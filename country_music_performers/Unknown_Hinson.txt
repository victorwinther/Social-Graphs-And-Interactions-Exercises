==Biography==
Stuart Daniel Baker, a music teacher and studio musician from [[Albemarle, North Carolina]], created his alter-ego for ''The Wild Wild South'', a Charlotte-area public-access program that featured comedy sketches and concert footage. Baker and co-star Don Swan played the characters of Unknown Hinson and Rebel Helms, respectively. After Swan's death in 1995, Baker created ''The Unknown Hinson Show'', a direct spin-off of ''The Wild Wild South''. ''The Unknown Hinson Show'' won [[Creative Loafing|Creative Loafing Charlotte's]] "Best Of" poll for Best Public-Access Television Show four years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainx.com/ae/1999/1027unknown.php |title=Into the Unknown &#124; Asheville Arts and Entertainment &#124; Mountain Xpress |publisher=Mountainx.com |access-date=August 13, 2011}}</ref> After the series ended, Baker continued in his role as Unknown Hinson, performing live concerts and releasing several recordings.

==Career==

===Live performing career===
Hinson has performed with many notable [[rockabilly]], [[country music|country]], and [[psychobilly]] acts such as [[The Reverend Horton Heat]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Hank III]], and [[Ed King]]. Hank III, grandson of [[Hank Williams]], has Hinson's face tattooed on his bicep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/inside-the-heathen-mind-of-hank-iii/Content?oid=929012 | title=Inside the Heathen Mind of Hank III: An interview with country music's self-exiled prince |publisher=[[Boise Weekly]] | date=August 9, 2006| access-date=November 18, 2015}}</ref>
In late 2008, working under the name Danny Baker, Hinson was hired to play bass as well as lead guitar in Billy Bob Thornton's band The Boxmasters. For this  gig, Baker appears without the familiar Unknown Hinson wardrobe and makeup, instead appearing in a vintage '60s suit, white shirt, and black pencil tie. His manager and booking agent was his wife, Margo Baker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/charlotte/obituary.aspx?pid=163309087#fbLoggedOut |title=Margo Elizabeth Cogan Baker Obituary: View Margo Baker's Obituary by Charlotte Observer |publisher=[[Legacy.com]] |access-date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/unknown-hinson |title=Unknown Hinson: Information from |publisher=[[Answers.com]] |access-date=September 4, 2013}}</ref>

According to a November 10, 2012 post on his Facebook page, Hinson decided to quit touring after 17 years. He cited rising costs and indicated his plans to find something new to do. After the death of his wife, Margo Baker, Unknown Hinson resumed touring again.

On June 3, 2020, Baker announced on his Facebook page that he would not be playing any more shows due to [[osteoarthritis]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hinson|first=Unknown|date=June 3, 2020|title=My dear friends, Unfortunately I don't...|url=https://www.facebook.com/Officialunknownhinsonstuartbaker/photos/a.250536291967520/1159941584360315/?type=3&theater|publisher=Facebook.com}}</ref> On July 17, 2023, he announced on his Facebook page that he was recovering from two strokes and undergoing physical therapy.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/Officialunknownhinsonstuartbaker/posts/pfbid02rLvnEmaffWWQuQqGZyaHM4gKzyQXMXQsZ8m8uuLYwk1kUaBuphGS1NT5tMATRVuRl Facebook post from July 17, 2023]</ref>

===Recording career===
[[File:Unknown Hinson.jpg|thumb|upright|Hinson in 2009]]
Unknown Hinson wrote his own music, and produced all of his own recordings. His music often parodied the dark elements of contemporary country and redneck culture. In early 2009, Hinson's "Torture Town" won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards and Vox Pop vote for Best Alternative Country.

===Voice acting career===
Hinson, credited as Baker, provided the voice of Early Cuyler, a balding hillbilly squid from [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]], on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night [[Adult Swim]] program ''[[Squidbillies]]'' for 15 years.<ref name="yasharoff">{{Cite news|last=Yasharoff|first=Hannah|title='Squidbillies' star Unknown Hinson fired over 'extremely offensive' posts about BLM, Dolly Parton|url=https://www.jacksonville.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/08/19/squidbillies-star-unknown-hinson-fired-over-blm-dolly-parton-posts/3398793001/|date=August 19, 2020|access-date=August 19, 2020|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Controversy==
On August 13, 2020, Baker received backlash after posting comments about [[Dolly Parton]], calling her a "bimbo" and "slut" on his Facebook page in response to a recent news article concerning Parton's support of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.<ref name=Andrew/> Not long after this post, the Facebook page went offline, but returned on the following day with the posts concerning Parton removed.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Baker subsequently posted a response to those who were upset, telling liberals to "unfriend" him and telling them to have fun "forsaking your own race, culture, and heritage."<ref name=Andrew>{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Andrew|title= Unknown Hinson, 'Squidbillies' Star, Goes on Tirade About Dolly Parton's Black Lives Matter Support |url= https://popculture.com/country-music/news/unknown-hinson-squidbillies-star-tirade-dolly-parton-black-lives-matter-support//|date=August 19, 2020|access-date=August 19, 2020|website=Pop Culture}}</ref>

The producers of ''Squidbillies'' fired Baker from the series over his remarks.<ref name="yasharoff"/> [[Reverend Musical Instruments|Reverend Guitars]] of Ohio abruptly stopped marketing their Stuart Baker signature series guitars on August 14, 2020, and posted, "we are no longer associated with Unknown Hinson.
