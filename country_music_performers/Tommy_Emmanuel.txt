'''William Thomas Emmanuel''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (born 31 May 1955) is an Australian guitarist. Originally a session player in many bands, he has released many award-winning recordings as a solo artist. In June 2010, Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM);<ref name="It's an Honour: AM">{{cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1142663 |title=It's an Honour – Honours – Search Australian Honours |publisher=Itsanhonour.gov.au |date=14 June 2010 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> in 2011, he was inducted into the [[Australian Roll of Renown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcmf.com.au/What-s-On/Roll-of-Renown/ |title=Roll of Renown|publisher=TCMF |access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref> In 2019, he was listed by MusicRadar as the best [[acoustic guitar]]ist in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|date=12 December 2019|first=Matt |last=Parker |title=The 10 best acoustic guitarists in the world today|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/the-10-best-acoustic-guitarists-in-the-world-today|access-date=2021-08-03|website=MusicRadar|language=en}}</ref>

==Life and career==
One of six children, Emmanuel was born in [[Muswellbrook, New South Wales]], Australia, in 1955. He received his first guitar in 1959 at age four and was taught by his mother to accompany her playing [[lap steel guitar]]. In 1961, at the age of six, he heard [[Chet Atkins]] playing on the radio. He vividly remembers that moment and said it greatly inspired him as a musician.<ref name="pritcher">{{cite web |url=http://users.adam.com.au/donald/markinter.htm |title=The Official Tommy Emmanuel Web Site – Interview |publisher=Users.adam.com.au |date=19 April 1997 |access-date=17 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010192609/http://users.adam.com.au/donald/markinter.htm |archive-date=10 October 2013 }}</ref>

By the age of six, he was a working professional musician. Recognizing the musical talents of Emmanuel and his older brother, [[Phil Emmanuel|Phil]], their father created a family band, sold their home, and took his family on the road. With the family living in two station wagons, much of Emmanuel's childhood was spent touring Australia, playing rhythm guitar, and rarely going to school. After their father died in 1966, Australian Country Music star [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]] approached the family and asked permission to take the Emmanuel brothers on the road with his touring show travelling around Australia. Tommy Emmanuel would go on to record a number of Buddy Williams albums in the early 1970s. The family settled in Parkes after the [[New South Wales Department of Education]] insisted that the Emmanuel children had to go to school regularly. <ref name="cmonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymusiconline.net/tommyemmanuel.html |title=Tommy Emmanuel: c.g.p |publisher=Countrymusiconline.net|access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>

In his teen years, Tommy Emmanuel moved to Sydney, and was noticed nationally when he won a string of talent contests. <ref name="pritcher" /><ref name="musicfrisk">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfrisk.com/picture/interview/tommy.emmanuel.fingerstyle.02.14.2003.php |title=Tommy Emmanuel Interview |publisher=Music Frisk |date=14 February 2003 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> By the late 1970s, he was playing drums with his brother Phil in the group Goldrush as well as doing session work on numerous albums and jingles. He gained further prominence in the late 1970s as the lead guitarist in the Southern Star Band, the backing group for vocalist [[Doug Parkinson]]. During 1986–1988 and 1995, he joined the lineup of the leading New Zealand/Australian 1970s rock group [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]] that had reformed in 1982, touring widely with them, including a 1987 tour with [[Tina Turner]]; he left the group to embark on a solo career.

In 1994, Australian music veteran [[John Farnham]] invited him to play the guitar next to Stuart Fraser from [[Noiseworks]] for the ''Concert for Rwanda''. Emmanuel had previously been a member of Farnham's band during the early 1980s and featured on the album ''[[Uncovered (John Farnham album)|Uncovered]]'' and rejoined after the 1994 concert.

In July 1999, [[Chet Atkins]] commented that Emmanuel was a "fearless" [[fingerpicking]] guitar player and awarded Tommy and four others ([[John Knowles (guitarist)|John Knowles]], [[Marcel Dadi]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[Steve Wariner]]) the "Certified Guitar Player" title.<ref name=Certified>{{cite news|last1=St. James|first1=Adam|title=Tommy Emmanuel: Certified Guitar Player|url=https://www.guitar.com/articles/tommy-emmanuel-certified-guitar-player|access-date=3 June 2019|publisher=Guitar.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111083823/https://guitar.com/articles/tommy-emmanuel-certified-guitar-player|archive-date=11 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="Certified Wariner">{{cite magazine|last1=Thompson|first1=Art|title=Steve Wariner|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1013/steve-wariner/11636|magazine=[[Guitar Player]]|access-date=25 October 2015|date=1 September 2009}}</ref>

Emmanuel and his brother Phil performed live in Sydney at the closing ceremony of the [[Summer Olympics]] in 2000. The event was televised worldwide with an estimated 2.85&nbsp;billion viewers.<ref name="musicfrisk" />

In December 2007, he was diagnosed with heart problems<ref>{{cite web |url=http://break-hollywood.blogspot.com/2007/12/oz-music-legend-tommy-emmanuel-falls.html |title= Oz music legend Tommy Emmanuel falls ill|website=break-hollywood.blogspot.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316231641/http://break-hollywood.blogspot.com/2007/12/oz-music-legend-tommy-emmanuel-falls.html |archive-date=16 March 2010}}</ref> and was forced to take a break from his hectic touring schedule due to exhaustion but returned to full-time touring in early 2008.

In June 2010, Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM).<ref name="It's an Honour: AM"/>

At the 2011 ‘TommyFest’, Tommy took the chance to talk to the audience about his strong Christian faith.
“The Lord is my shepherd, so I lack nothing—it’s true!” he told the gathered crowds.

In 2012, Governor [[Steve Beshear]] awarded Emmanuel the state of Kentucky's honorific title of [[Kentucky Colonel]].<ref name="BroadwayWorld.com Kentucky Colonel">{{cite web|author1=Music News Desk|title=Tommy Emmanuel to Tour United States Alongside Martin Taylor in Early 2014|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Tommy-Emmanuel-to-Tour-United-States-Alongside-Martin-Taylor-in-Early-2014-20140114|access-date=25 October 2015|website=BroadwayWorld.com|date=14 January 2014}}</ref>

In 2009 he worked with fellow local artists [[Ray Burgess]], [[Marty Rhone]], [[John St Peeters]] and [[Swanee (singer)|John "Swanee" Swan]] to release a single, "Legends of the Southern Land".<ref name="Pascuzzi">{{cite news | archive-url = https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20131018132000/http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/63544/20131019-0020/www.mediasearch.com.au/music/wrap/legendsofthesouthernland.html | url = http://www.mediasearch.com.au/music/wrap/legendsofthesouthernland.html | title = 'Legends of the Southern Land' – a new Australian anthem | last = Pascuzzi | first = Carmine | work = MediaSearch | archive-date = 18 October 2013 | access-date = 13 May 2017 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

During a July 2019 concert he mentioned recently receiving American citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theday.com/article/20190719/ENT10/190719396 |title=Review: Acoustic guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, Mike Dawes dazzle Garde crowd |date=19 July 2019 |website=The Day |language=en-US |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

==Guitar style==
[[File:Tommy Emmanuel flickr.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Emmanuel's fingerstyle technique was featured at a June 2006 performance at [[City Stages]] in Birmingham, Alabama]]
Emmanuel had said that even at a young age he was fascinated by [[Chet Atkins|Chet Atkins's]] musical style (sometimes referred to as [[Travis picking]]) of playing bass lines, chords, melodies, and harmonies simultaneously using the thumb and fingers of the right hand, achieving a dynamic range of sound from the instrument. Although Emmanuel's playing incorporates a multitude of musical influences and styles, including [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]] and rock, this type of [[country music|country]] finger-style playing is at the core of his technique. While Emmanuel has never had formal music training and does not read or write music, his natural musical ability, intrinsic sense of rhythm, and charisma gained him fans from all over the world. As a solo performer, he never plays to a setlist and uses a minimum of effects onstage.<ref name="musicfrisk" /> He usually completes studio recordings in one take.

[[File:2024-09-18 Concert of Tommy Emmanuel and Mike Dawes at UdK Berlin Konzertsaal (Martin Rulsch) 163.jpg|thumb|Emmanuel uses a snare-drum brush to emulate the sound of a percussion kit]]
In his solo shows, he mainly plays guitars made by [[Maton]], an Australian guitar manufacturer. He usually travels with two custom Maton EBG808 TE models and one TE1 model, both of which are Tommy Emmanuel artist signature models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maton.com.au/product/te-series|title=The Maton TE Series - Maton Guitars Australia|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> He has played Maton guitars for most of his career and is somewhat of an ambassador for the company due to his long-standing association with the brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maton.com.au/artists/tommy-emmanuel|title=Tommy Emmanuel - Maton Guitars Australia|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> Emmanuel is known for the battered and worn-down appearances of his guitars; a result of his dynamic, energetic playing and percussive techniques. One of his signature performances, for example, involves striking the whole body of the guitar in various places with his hands or a drummer's [[Drum brush#Brushes|snare-drum brush]] to emulate the sound of a percussion kit.

Emmanuel usually keeps one Maton EBG808 in standard guitar tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E), while he tunes his second Maton EBG808 to D-G-D-G-B-E (G6 tuning) and his TE1 to C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}. He generally uses 0.12 gauge (light) strings on one EBG808 and 0.13 gauge (medium) strings on the second Maton EBG808 and on the TE1. This allows him to quickly change tuning by swapping between guitars during a show if needed, rather than spending time onstage re-tuning one guitar.{{Cn|date=December 2023}}

Emmanuel often curls his left thumb around the neck of the guitar onto the [[fretboard]] to play some notes, rather than using only his fingers to play — contrary to how classical guitarists play, but not unusual for jazz and country guitarists. He frequently plays common three-finger chord shapes with just two fingers. He commonly uses a [[thumbpick]], a flat pick ([[plectrum]]), his fingers, or a combination of these in his playing, a style known as [[hybrid picking]]. Amongst his trademark rapid virtuoso licks and cascading harmonic progressions, he often uses a technique that imitated an electric guitar's tremolo system on acoustic guitar — by pressing the palm of his right hand against the [[Sound board (music)|sound board]] of the guitar near the neck joint, while maintaining forward pressure with his left hand on the top of the [[headstock]]. The guitar neck slightly bends away from the body and consequently affects the pitch of the strings to achieve the desired sound.{{Cn|date=December 2023}}

==Influences==
As a young man in Australia, Emmanuel wrote to his hero [[Chet Atkins]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Eventually, Atkins replied with words of encouragement and a long-standing invitation to drop by to visit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://justjazzguitar.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=329&Itemid=52 |title=Just Jazz Guitar Online – Tommy Emmanuel Interview |publisher=Justjazzguitar.com |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>

In 1997, Emmanuel and Atkins recorded as a duo, releasing the album ''[[The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World]]''. It would be Atkins's last album, with the exception of "Solo Sessions" which Atkins' estate released posthumously.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chet Atkins: Solo Sessions|url=https://www.misterguitar.us/news/solorelease.html|access-date=2021-04-25|website=www.misterguitar.us}}</ref> Emmanuel and Atkins appeared together on [[The Nashville Network]]'s 'Country Christmas' in late 1997, and on that occasion, Atkins stated about him: "He is one of the greatest guitar players I've ever seen." Atkins gave Emmanuel the guitar on which [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith]] recorded "Guitar Boogie", one of the foundation performances of the blues guitar world and a regular feature of Emmanuel's shows.

In July 1999, at the 15th Annual Chet Atkins Appreciation Society Convention,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.misterguitar.com/caas/index.html |title=The Chet Atkins Appreciation Society |publisher=Misterguitar.com |date=21 December 1997 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> Atkins presented Emmanuel with a Certified Guitar Player award, an honour Chet personally bestowed to only four guitarists.<ref name="pritcher" /> This award gains its fame from being bestowed by Atkins himself, a widely recognised leader in guitar music. The award states: "In Recognition of His Contributions to the Art of Fingerpicking." Tommy performed at the Chet Atkins Appreciation Society (CAAS) in July each year in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/002881.html |title= Tommy Emmanuel Interview|website=www.modernguitars.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135648/http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/002881.html |archive-date=9 May 2008}}</ref>

In addition to being influenced by Chet Atkins, Emmanuel has stated that he and his brother [[Phil Emmanuel]] were inspired by and modelled themselves on [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Bruce Welch]] of [[the Shadows]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zollo |first1=Paul |title=Tommy Emmanuel: On Becoming "The World's Greatest Living Guitarist" |url=https://americansongwriter.com/tommy-emmanuel-on-becoming-the-worlds-greatest-living-guitarist/ |access-date=17 February 2022 |work=American Songwriter |date=20 August 2020}}</ref>
