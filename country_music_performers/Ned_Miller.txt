'''Henry Ned Miller''' (April 12, 1925 – March 18, 2016) was an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter. Active as a recording artist from 1956 to 1970, he is known primarily for his [[hit single]] "[[From a Jack to a King]]", a [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] hit in 1962 which reached [[Top 40|Top 10]] on the country music, adult contemporary, and [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|charts]], No. 1 for 5 weeks in [[CHUM Chart|Canada]], as well as reaching No.2 in the UK charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chumtribute.com/62-12-17-chart.jpg| title=CHUM Hit Parade - December 17, 1962}}</ref> He had several more chart singles in his career, although none matched the success of "From a Jack to a King". He also composed and recorded "Invisible Tears".

==Biography==
Miller's start as a songwriter came when he was sixteen years old.<ref name="allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p24586/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Ned Miller > Biography )))]</ref> He later joined the [[United States Marine Corps]], from which he was later discharged.

In 1956, both [[Gale Storm]] and [[Bonnie Guitar]] had Top Five hits with different versions of the song "[[Dark Moon (song)|Dark Moon]]", which Miller co-wrote.<ref name="allmusic"/> Another song he wrote, "A Fallen Star", was a country hit for [[Jimmy C. Newman]]. Very notable is also his uptempo song "Cave In", which in 1960 was the flip side of [[Warren Smith (singer)|Warren Smith]]'s No.&nbsp;5 country hit "I Don't Believe I'll Fall In Love Today" recorded for the [[Liberty Records]] label. He also wrote and recorded the song "From a Jack to a King", which was released on Fabor Records but saw little success on the charts.<ref name="oldies">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Ned-Miller.html|title=Ned Miller Biography|website=Oldies.com}}</ref> After being briefly signed to [[Capitol Records]], Miller returned to Fabor and persuaded them to re-release "[[From a Jack to a King]]". The song proved successful the second time around, and became a crossover hit for Miller.<ref name="allmusic"/> It sold over two million copies by July 1963, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Miller was not particularly interested in his singing career, and rarely toured owing to [[stage fright]].<ref name="oldies"/> He gave up recording in the 1970s and soon moved to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], [[Arizona]], and later to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].<ref name="oldies"/>

Country music artist [[Ricky Van Shelton]] covered "From a Jack to a King" in the 1980s; his version reached Number One on the country music chart.<ref name="allmusic"/>
