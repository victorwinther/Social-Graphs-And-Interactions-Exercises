'''Melvin Huston McDaniel''' (September 6, 1942 – March 31, 2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusicsover.com/2011/03/31/mel-mcdaniel/|title=» Died On This Date (March 31, 2011) Mel McDaniel / Country Music Star |website=Themusicsover.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref> was an American [[country music]] artist. Many of his top hits were released in the 1980s, including "[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]", "[[Big Ole Brew]]", "[[Stand Up (Mel McDaniel song)|Stand Up]]", "[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]" (which reached number one on the country chart), "[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]", "[[Stand on It (Bruce Springsteen song)|Stand on It]]", and a remake of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Let It Roll (Let It Rock)]]".

McDaniel's type of country music has been referred to as "the quintessential happy song" in comparison to other country artists who discuss broken hearts and lost loves. When asked why most of his songs were positive in their outlook, McDaniel told the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' that "there's enough things in the world to keep you bummed out" and that his fans did not want to "hear me singing something that's gonna bum 'em out some more."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tIIgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2818,1429291&dq=mel+mcdaniel+real+good+feel+good+song&hl=en|title=Good Ol' Boy|last=Perala|first=Andrew|date=October 19, 1989|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|access-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>
