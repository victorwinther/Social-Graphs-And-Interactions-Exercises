==Career==
Lovett began his music career as a singer-songwriter. By the early 1980s, Lovett had already distinguished himself in the burgeoning [[Texas]] folk acoustic scene.  He had performed in the New Folk competition at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]] in 1980 and 1982.<ref name = "KFF">"Kerrville Folk Festival Finalist History", compiled by Doug Coppock ([http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220031051/http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp |date=February 20, 2006}})</ref> An American singer, Buffalo Wayne, whom he had met in 1978 during a college trip to Germany, invited Lovett to play with him at the 1983 [[Schueberfouer]] in Luxembourg. One of the [[happening|events]] at the [[funfair]] was an American musical tent.  The owner of that event was a fan of the [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[house band]] J.

Some of his other film roles include ''[[Bastard out of Carolina (film)|Bastard Out Of Carolina]]'' (1996), ''[[The New Guy]]'' (2002), ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' (2007), and a humorous role in ''[[Angels Sing]]'', a family Christmas movie (alongside fellow actors and musicians such as [[Harry Connick, Jr.]], [[Connie Britton]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1833888/ |title=Angels Sing |publisher=IMDb|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> His television acting forays include guest roles on ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', a recurring role on ''[[The Bridge (2013 TV series)|The Bridge]]'' (as Flagman, a lawyer), and appearances as himself on ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' and ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.

Lovett was given an award called an "Esky" for Surest Thing in [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire's]] 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue. The magazine said of Lovett: "The secret of Lyle Lovett's endurance comes down to the three C's: class, [[charisma]] and consistency... In the studio and on stage with his giant orchestra, he's spent two decades gracefully matching genuine songcraft with A-list musicianship".

In 2010, Lovett appeared on an episode of ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]'' that also featured [[John Prine]] and [[Ray LaMontagne]].

In 2011, Lovett was named ''Texas State Artist Musician ''by the Texas Commission on the Arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.texas.gov/initiatives/texas-state-artist/state-musician/ |title=State Musician &#124; Texas Commission on the Arts |website=Arts.texas.gov |access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref>
