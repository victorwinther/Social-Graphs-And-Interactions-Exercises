'''The Lynns''' are an American [[country music]] duo, consisting of twin sisters [[Peggy Lynn]] and [[Patsy Lynn]] (born August 6, 1964<ref name="whitburn"/>), who are the youngest daughters of [[Oliver Lynn]] and singer [[Loretta Lynn]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lynns-mn0000054423|title=The Lynns biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>

They recorded one album for [[Reprise Records]], which charted two singles on [[Hot Country Songs]]. The Lynns have received [[Country Music Association|CMA Award]] nominations for Vocal Duo of the Year in 1998 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/cma-awards/1998.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114055402/http://www.cmt.com/cma-awards/1998.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 14, 2014|title=1998 CMA awards|work=CMT.com|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/cma-awards/1999.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114055400/http://www.cmt.com/cma-awards/1999.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 14, 2014|title=1999 CMA awards|work=CMT.com|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>

Their album was met with mixed reception. Peter Margasak of ''Chicago Reader'' wrote that "musically they don't show much more spunk. Their singing...is no match for their mother's, but they're certainly not alone there....most of the material is typical Nashville mush: weepy ballads and tame, predictable rockers."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/triumph-of-the-swill/Content?oid=895774|title=Triumph of the swill|last=Margasak|first=Peter|date=March 12, 1998|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref> Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] praised the duo's "powerful voices" but criticized the "formulaic production".<ref name="ankeny"/>
