They hail from the neighbouring counties of [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Bedfordshire]] in England. "[[Shire]]" is the original term for what is usually known as a county in the United Kingdom. The duo took the band name to maintain a British identity and take a small part of Britain to the United States. After playing hardly half a dozen shows together, The Shires caught the attention of [[Decca Records]], who signed them in the United Kingdom, and they secured a contract with American record label [[Universal Music Group Nashville]], thus becoming the first English country act to be signed to a major Nashville label.<ref name="The Sunday Times Article">[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article1405270.ece The Sunday Times: That British twang, Country is being reborn in Bedford, not Nashville] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513064640/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article1405270.ece |date=13 May 2014 }}.

In 2019, Earle and Rhodes were awarded Honorary Doctorates of the Arts by the University of Bedfordshire for their services to the Arts.

In March 2020, The Shires were announced to be playing the main stage at the [[C2C: Country to Country]] festival, replacing [[Old Dominion (band)|Old Dominion]] who withdrew due to concerns over the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], making The Shires the first UK country act to perform a set on the main stage.

March 2020 saw the release of a compilation album called Greatest Hits which  saw the end of their record deal with their record label Decca. The album featured highlights from all three studio albums to that point  as well as many of the bands singles. However, chart wise it failed to equal the success of their other albums only reaching NO52.

The duo also released in March 2020 a new album for their new label BMG entitled Good Years. A single "This Independence Day" was included. This album also saw the group return to the top five of both the Country and National charts which they had also achieved with their previous two studio albums.
