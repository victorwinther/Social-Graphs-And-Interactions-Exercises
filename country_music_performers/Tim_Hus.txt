'''Tim Hus''' (born in [[Nelson, British Columbia]])<ref name="Myles" /> is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[country music|country]]/[[folk music|folk]] singer, based out of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada.

Tim Hus and his Travelin' Band, which includes bull [[fiddle]]r Riley Tubbs, Billy MacInnis on lead guitar and fiddle, and occasionally Pat Phillips on drums, have toured from coast to coast performing their true Canadian music. His music is coined as "Canadiana Cowboy Music" and tells tales of the Historic West and those who formed it. Tim has shared the stage with many other great talents such as Canadian legend [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Tim Harwill]] and [[Gary Fjellgaard]] and worked with [[Corb Lund]] on the song "Hurtin' Albertan".

He has worked as a carpenter's helper, framer, warehouse hand, [[forklift]] driver, van driver, treeplanter, brewery worker, beer truck driver, fruit picker, fisherman, pine cone picker, sawhand, cabinet maker, well driller, painter, courier, assembly line worker, salmon farmer, furniture mover, labourer, and a maintenance man.

In September 2016, Hus fell while helping a friend repair a roof, shattering his heel. During the resulting time in hospital, somebody used Hus's identity to open several credit card accounts.<ref name="Myles">{{cite news |last1=Myles |first1=Ruth |title=Housebound on the Range: Smashed heel won't stop Stompin' Tom disciple Tim Hus |url=https://calgaryherald.com/life/swerve/housebound-on-the-range-smashed-heel-wont-stop-stompin-tom-disciple-tim-hus |access-date=10 October 2021 |work=Calgary Herald |date=3 February 2017 |language=en-CA}}</ref>
