== History ==

Having met in [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]], banjo player Dave Johnston requested Jeff Austin to join and sing in his band The Bluegrassholes. Austin, who played no [[Musical instrument|instrument]], revealed to Johnston that he owned a [[mandolin]], who then told him to come to the performance and "play anything, just play fast and loud."<ref name="austin">{{Cite web|url=http://yondermountain.com/yonder/jeffbio.htm|title=Yonder Mountain String Band; Biography of Jeff Austin|access-date=2006-11-28|publisher=Yonder Mountain Enterprises|year=2001|author=Yonder Mountain Enterprises |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061111153830/http://www.yondermountain.com/yonder/jeffbio.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-11-11}}</ref>

After the collapse of The Bluegrassholes, Johnston moved to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado, in order to further his bluegrass musical skills. Similarly, Austin moved to Colorado, but instead took up residence in the mountain town of [[Nederland, Colorado]] . Johnston soon joined him there.<ref name="allmusic">{{allMusic|id=p484180|tab=biography|label= Biography for Yonder Mountain String Band|access-date=2006-11-28|year=2006|last=Ruhlmann|first=William}}</ref> It was during this time in Nederland that Johnston and Austin met [[Bass guitar|bassist]] Ben Kaufmann and [[guitar]]ist Adam Aijala at a local club named the Verve.<ref name="allmusic"/> In December 1998, the four musicians formed Yonder Mountain String Band which was to open for a band at the [[Fox Theatre (Boulder)|Fox Theatre]] in Boulder. The band developed both a bluegrass and [[jam band]] fan base, and can often be found on [[Concert|tour]]. Their debut album ''[[Elevation (Yonder Mountain String Band album)|Elevation]]'' was released on [[Frog Pad Records]], an [[independent record label]] run by the band, in the fall of 1999.

From 1999 to 2001 they performed as one of the many attractions at [[NedFest]],<ref name="nedfest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nedfest.com/|title=NedFest; Nederland Music and Arts Festival|access-date=2006-11-28|publisher=NedFest|year=2006|author=NedFest}}</ref> a [[music festival]] held in the band's hometown.  By 2000, the group was also playing larger venues, such as [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco, California]]. In 2005, their recording of "[[Think for Yourself]]" was included on the album ''[[This Bird Has Flown – A 40th Anniversary Tribute to the Beatles' Rubber Soul]]''.

In 2008, the band performed at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]].

In 2010, it was revealed that Yonder Mountain would host a music festival at Mulberry Mountain in [[Ozark, Arkansas]] called Yonder Mountain's Harvest Festival. This is the same site where the larger Wakarusa festival is held and where the previous Mulberry Mountain Harvest Fest was held. In 2011, the festival's headliners included [[Bela Fleck and the Flecktones]], the Simcha Aknin Band, [[Railroad Earth]] and the [[Emmitt-Nershi Band]].<ref name="harvestfest">{{Cite web|url=http://headstash.com/news-nugs/festivals/950-harvest-fest-2011-ymsb-bela-fleck-rre-emmitt-nershi/|title=Harvest Fest 2011|access-date=2011-06-12|publisher=HeadStash|year=2011|author=HeadStash}}</ref>

In April 2014, Austin left the band due to "creative differences and conflicting career goals".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jambands.com/news/2014/04/23/jeff-austin-leaving-yonder-mountain-string-band/|title=Jeff Austin Leaving Yonder Mountain String Band|date=23 April 2014|website=Jambands.com|access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref> After touring with the band since Austin's departure, fiddle player Allie Kral and mandolin player Jake Jolliff became official members of Yonder Mountain String Band in May 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yondermountain.com/|title=Yonder Mountain String Band -|website=Yondermountain.com|access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref> In 2020, multi-instrumentalist/mandolinist Nick Piccininni joined after playing with the madgrass group Floodwood.
