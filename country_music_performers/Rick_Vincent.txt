'''Rick Vincent''' is an American [[country music]] artist. Signed to [[Curb Records]] in 1992, Vincent released his debut album, ''A Wanted Man'', the following year and had two singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart. The album and its two singles remain Vincent's only contributions as a recording artist.

Vincent moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1989 to pursue his musical career. After songwriter and producer [[Wendy Waldman]] discovered one of his demo tapes, he signed to [[Curb Records]] in 1992.<ref name="post">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/89597436/|title=Rick Vincent: ''A Wanted Man'' review|last=Sharpe|first=Jerry|date=June 11, 1993|work=Weekend Edition|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=19|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}</ref> His lone Curb album, ''A Wanted Man'', charted two singles: "The Best Mistakes I Ever Made" and "Ain't Been a Train Through Here in Years".<ref name="whitburn"/> The album received a positive review from [[Brian Mansfield]] of ''[[Allmusic]]'', who said that Vincent "writes thoughtful and literate lyrics" while praising Vincent's singing voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-wanted-man-mw0000093123|title=''A Wanted Man''|work=Allmusic|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}</ref> Similarly, a review in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' praised Vincent's lyricism and influence from the [[Bakersfield sound]], while also noting his "strong, rich baritone".<ref name="post"/> A third single from the album, "Hello, She Lied", did not chart,<ref name="lied"/> and Vincent never recorded again.
