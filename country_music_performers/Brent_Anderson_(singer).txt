'''Brent Anderson''' (born in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentandersonmusic.com/biography|title=Brent Anderson biography|work=Brent Anderson|accessdate=29 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114045037/http://www.brentandersonmusic.com/biography|archive-date=14 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>) is an American [[country music]] singer. He has charted on [[Hot Country Songs]] with the single "Amy's Song".

Anderson learned to play [[bass guitar]] at age 7, and later began playing [[acoustic guitar]] in a trio that included his father and father's cousin. By 17, Anderson had signed his first songwriting deal. He then signed with Sea Gayle, a division of [[Arista Nashville]] owned by [[Brad Paisley]].<ref name="weekly">{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Jessica|date=5 December 2011|title=Who's New: Brent Anderson|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=18|issue=50|page=18|issn=1074-3235}}</ref>

In late 2011, he released his debut single "Amy's Song". The song samples [[Pure Prairie League]]'s 1973 hit "[[Amie (song)|Amie]]" and includes backing vocals from [[Vince Gill]] and Pure Prairie League founder [[Craig Fuller]].<ref name="weekly"/> Taste of Country reviewer Billy Dukes gave the song four stars out of five, praising Anderson's "smoky" voice and the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/brent-anderson-amys-song/|title=Brent Anderson — 'Amy's Song' review|last=Dukes|first=Billy|date=7 September 2011|work=Taste of Country|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>

He wrote the 2014 song [[Lonely Tonight]], which was sung by [[Blake Shelton]] and hit number 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Country Airplay]] charts.

Although Anderson released no more material through Arista, he co-produced [[Chris Janson]]'s album ''[[Buy Me a Boat]]'' and the 2017 single "[[Fix a Drink]]". These songs also feature Anderson on background vocals and acoustic guitar.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Buy Me a Boat |others=Chris Janson |year=2015 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Warner Bros.
