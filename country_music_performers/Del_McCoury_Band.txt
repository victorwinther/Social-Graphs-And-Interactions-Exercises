The '''Del McCoury Band''' is a [[Grammy award]]-winning American [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band.

==History==
Originally the band was called [[Del McCoury]] and the Dixie Pals with Del on guitar and his brother Jerry on bass. The band went through a number of changes in personnel until the 1980s when the band solidified its line-up, adding McCoury's sons, [[Ronnie McCoury|Ronnie]] and [[Robbie McCoury|Robbie]] on mandolin and banjo, respectively.<ref>Kingsbury, Paul, [https://books.google.com/books?id=untabCgOVkgC&dq=del+McCoury&pg=PA335 The Encyclopedia of Country Music]. Oxford University Press, 1998. p. 335</ref> In 1988, the "Dixie Pals" name was dropped in favor of the current name. Fiddler Tad Marks and bass player Mike Brantley joined in the early 1990s while the band became a national touring act.<ref name=DM-nodep-1996>{{cite news|last1=Yates|first1=Don|title=Album Review: Del McCoury Band - The Cold Hard Facts|url=http://nodepression.com/album-review/del-mccoury-band-cold-hard-facts|access-date=17 April 2017|work=No Depression|date=31 October 1996|archive-date=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418163126/http://nodepression.com/album-review/del-mccoury-band-cold-hard-facts|url-status=dead}}</ref> The addition of fiddler [[Jason Carter (fiddler)|Jason Carter]] and bassist [[Mike Bub]] in 1992 created a lineup that was unchanged for 13 years.
