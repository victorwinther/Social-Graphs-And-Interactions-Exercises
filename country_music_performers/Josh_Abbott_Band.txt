Former recent members include Preston Wait (fiddle, guitar, steel guitar) and Caleb Keeter (guitar). 

==Biography==
Josh Abbott founded the band in 2006 in [[Lubbock, Texas]] while attending [[Texas Tech University]], where he was a member of the Texas Epsilon chapter of [[Phi Delta Theta]]. He founded the band while in grad school with fraternity brothers Austin Davis, Neel Huey, and Andrew Hurt. The band recorded a 4-song demo including "Taste" in 2007 along with fiddler Preston Wait and began touring in 2008. Huey and Hurt dropped out to pursue careers while Preston Wait and Eddie Villanueva officially joined. The band then recorded their debut album “Scapegoat” in 2008 as well. Caleb Keeter and James Hertless joined in 2010, with Hertless eventually departing in 2018.

The sophomore album, ''She's Like Texas'', followed in 2010 and entered the [[Top Country Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/shes-like-texas-r1716295/charts-awards|title=''She's Like Texas'' chart positions|work=Allmusic|accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref> Michael Berick of [[Allmusic]] rated it four stars out of five, comparing it to [[Steve Earle]] and saying that Abbott's songwriting showed "maturity". They had their first sell-out crowd at "Billy Bobs Texas" in the historic Fort Worth Stockyards on February 10, 2010, selling 6,000 tickets.<ref name="amg">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/shes-like-texas-r1716295|title=''She's Like Texas'' review|last=Berick|first=Michael|work=Allmusic|accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>
