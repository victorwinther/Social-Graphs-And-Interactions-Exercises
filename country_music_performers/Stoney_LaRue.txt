'''Stoney LaRue''' (born '''Stoney Larue Phillips'''; 1977) is an American [[Texas country]]/[[Red dirt (music)|Red dirt]] artist.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Taft, Texas]], LaRue was raised in Yanush/Buffalo Valley, Oklahoma, where he still visits regularly and began playing country music at a young age.

LaRue moved to [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], and began to play in the various bars around the college town, as well as his brother, Bo Phillips. He befriended [[Jason Boland & the Stragglers|Jason Boland]] and [[Cody Canada]] and the three moved into the infamous "Yellow House" where they would have late night jam sessions and entertain other various musicians around the town, like [[Mike McClure]] and [[Brandon Jenkins (singer/songwriter)|Brandon Jenkins]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Galleywinter Interview with Cody Canada |url=http://www.galleywinter.com/main/News/article/sid=402.html}}</ref> LaRue was heavily influenced by Woody Guthrie, Bob Childers, Mike Hosty and the "Red Dirt" music scene.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode228 episode 228 of the Americana Music Show], published January 12, 2015</ref> 
 
In 2002, LaRue led The Organic Boogie Band and released ''Downtown'', recorded in private sessions at Cain's Ballroom in [[Tulsa]]. LaRue's 2005 follow-up, ''The Red Dirt Album'', reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' sales charts in its debut week. The next year, Stoney released his first live record ''Live at Billy Bob's Texas''.

LaRue sang backing vocals on [[Miranda Lambert]]'s 2013 single "[[All Kinds of Kinds]]."<ref name="taste">{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/miranda-lambert-all-kinds-of-kinds/|title=Miranda Lambert, 'All Kinds of Kinds'&nbsp;– Song Review|author=Billy Dukes|date=June 10, 2013|publisher=Taste of Country|access-date=July 7, 2013}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==
On the morning of July 20, 2015, LaRue was arrested and charged with domestic abuse after an altercation involving his then girlfriend Amanda Winsworth. Winsworth claimed in court documents that she was getting ready for work when LaRue began physically assaulting her and ultimately pushed her down a flight of stairs in their home. LaRue was released from jail on $4,000 bond ({{Inflation|US|4000|2015|fmt=eq|r=-2}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}) later that day. The next morning, Winsworth rescinded part of her account of the assault on Twitter stating that the incident had been blown out of proportion by the media.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schwab |first=Kyle |title=Girlfriend says in court documents that musician LaRue punched her |url=https://www.oklahoman.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/22/girlfriend-says-in-court-documents-that-musician-larue-punched-her/60733862007/ |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=The Oklahoman |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Whitaker |first=Sterling|title=Stoney LaRue Arrested, Charged With Domestic Abuse |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/stony-larue-arrested-domestic-abuse/ |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=Taste of Country |language=en}}</ref>
