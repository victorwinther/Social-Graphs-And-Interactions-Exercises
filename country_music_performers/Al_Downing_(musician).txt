That same year, Downing produced "Midnight Lace," which reached the 50s on the charts, and "I Ain't No Fool," which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the "Story Behind The Story" reached the Top 40 and "Bring It On Home" reached the Top 20.

In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including "Mr. Jones."

In July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.

In 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry.
