'''Charles Samuel Bush''' (born April 13, 1952) is an American [[mandolin]]ist who is considered an originator of [[progressive bluegrass]] music. In 2020, he was inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] as a member of [[New Grass Revival]]. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame a second time in 2023 as a solo artist.

==History==
Born in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], Kentucky, Bush was exposed to country and bluegrass music at an early age through his father, Charlie's, record collection, and later by the [[Foggy Mountain Boys|Flatt & Scruggs]] television show. Buying his first mandolin at the age of 11, his musical interest was further piqued when he attended the inaugural Roanoke, VA Bluegrass Festival in 1965.  As a teen, Bush took first place three times in the junior division of the National Oldtime Fiddler's Contest in Weiser, ID. He joined guitarist Wayne Stewart, his mentor and music teacher during Sam's teen years, and banjoist [[Alan Munde]] (later of Country Gazette) and the three recorded an instrumental album, ''Poor Richard's Almanac'', in 1969.<ref>{{cite web

The New Grass Revival went through numerous personnel changes, with Bush remaining as the sole original member. Bassist and vocalist [[John Cowan]] joined in 1974, with [[banjo]] ace [[Béla Fleck]] and acoustic guitarist [[Pat Flynn (musician)|Pat Flynn]] being enlisted in 1981. From 1979 through 1981, the group toured with [[Leon Russell]], opening the shows and backing Russell during his headlining set.<ref>{{Cite journal

Beginning in 1980, Bush and Cowan periodically jammed with the Nashville-based Duckbutter Blues Band, whose other members were blues guitarist Kenny Lee, drummer Jeff Jones, and bassist Byron House. Bush recorded his debut solo album, ''Late as Usual'', four years later. In 1989, Bush and Fleck joined [[Mark O'Connor]], [[Jerry Douglas]], and [[Edgar Meyer]] in an all-star bluegrass band, [[Strength in Numbers (band)|Strength in Numbers]], at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]] in [[Colorado]]. When the New Grass Revival dissolved in 1989, Bush joined [[Emmylou Harris]]' Nash Ramblers, touring and recording with Harris for the next five years.

In 1995, Bush worked as a sideman with [[Lyle Lovett]] and Bela Fleck's [[Flecktones]]. He formed his own band, featuring Cowan and ex-Nash Ramblers Jon Randall and Larry Atamanuick, shortly before recording his second solo album, ''Glamour & Grits'', in 1996. He released his next album, ''Howlin' at the Moon'', in 1998, with many of the same players and special guests, including Harris, Fleck and [[J. D. Crowe]].

In the winter of 1997, Bush and the New Grass Revival reunited for an appearance on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] as the backup band for [[Garth Brooks]]. On March 28, 1998, Bush's hometown of [[Bowling Green, KY]], honored him with a special "Sam Bush Day" celebration.

Following ''Howlin' at the Moon'' in 1998, he released ''Ice Caps: Peaks of Telluride in 2000'', which was a live recording. In 2004, Randall left Bush's band and [[Brad Davis (musician)|Brad Davis]] took over harmony vocals and guitar duties.

In 2006, Bush released ''[[Laps in Seven]]''. The release was significant because it marked the return of the [[banjo]] to Bush's recordings, played by [[Scott Vestal]]. The guitarist, Keith Sewell, performed on the recording, but shortly after took a job with the [[Dixie Chicks]]. Bush sought a new guitarist for his recordings and road band and found [[Stephen Mougin]].

In 2007, Bush released his first [[live concert]] DVD, titled ''On The Road''. 2007 also marked the first time he had been chosen to host the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Awards.

Bush contributed to two bluegrass [[tribute album]]s to the British [[Progressive Rock]] band [[the Moody Blues]] – 2004's ''[[Moody Bluegrass]]: A Nashville Tribute to the Moody Blues'', and 2011's ''[[Moody Bluegrass]] TWO...Much Love''. Bush provided the lead vocal for the [[Ray Thomas]] song "Nice To Be Here" on the latter album.

==Performance==

As well as being an accomplished [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] vocalist, Bush also is an accomplished instrumentalist on mandolin and [[fiddle]] winning title of National Fiddle champion at fifteen years of age.  He was a founding member of the [[New Grass Revival]] and has been called a modern-day [[Bill Monroe]], or as Sam would tell . .
{{cquote|. . if Bill was the father of bluegrass then I could be the mother because Monroe would say: 'here comes that mother now!'}}
Sam, affectionately  "Sammy", or "Mr. Entertainment", also recalls meeting Mr. Monroe as a young teen. After demonstrating his mandolin technique Monroe offered the advice: "stick to the fiddle".
[[File:Sam Bush and Byron House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|With Byron House, March 27, 2007.]]
Sam is one of the main attractions at the annual [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]] in [[Telluride, Colorado]] and plays the eight p.m. set on Saturday night as well as many guest appearances throughout the weekend. He is affectionately known as "The King of Telluride" for his perennial appearances there (and [[Emmylou Harris]] the "Queen of Telluride").  Sam did tour with Harris' band, The Nash Ramblers. Additional collaborations include recording and live performances with many virtuoso musicians and artists such as [[Doc Watson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Ann Savoy]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Peter Rowan]], Russ Barenberg, [[David Grisman]], Mark O'Connor, Edgar Meyer, and importantly; "Strength in Numbers", a band consisting of [[Bela Fleck]], [[Mark O'Connor]], [[Edgar Meyer]], [[Jerry Douglas]], and Sam Bush.

Strength in Numbers was a collaboration born from jam sessions at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. The music on their CD release entitled "The Telluride Sessions" was all instrumental and recorded live, showcasing the individual talent of each player and their ability to improvise. During recent years (2000–2008) there have been many variations of the Strength in Numbers band, also known as "Bluegrass Sessions", always including Jerry Douglas, ([[Dobro]]), and usually bassist Byron House, also from [[Bowling Green, KY]]. Other musicians include Gabe Witcher ([[fiddle]]), [[Bryan Sutton]] (guitar), [[Tim O'Brien (musician)|Tim O'Brien]] ([[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], guitar, vocals) and Darol Anger ([[fiddle]]).

Sam Bush Band tours extensively, appearing at many small venues and large festivals such as the [[Strawberry Music Festival]] ([[Memorial Day]] and Labor Day), Rockygrass (late July), and every spring at the [[Americana Festival (music)|Americana Festival]], [[Merlefest]] in [[Wilkesboro, North Carolina]].  Sam Bush is known as one of the liveliest performers at these festivals, and makes many guest appearances with the other artists.
