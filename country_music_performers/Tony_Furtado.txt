==Awards and honors ==
* Won [[National Bluegrass Banjo Championship]], [[Winfield, Kansas]], 1987 and 1991

==Musical style==
Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumental-ist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef.  Comparisons to [[Ry Cooder]] were rooted in Furtado's combination of jazz, Celtic, and old-time music. On his third album, ''Full Circle'' (1994) he concentrated on acoustic blues and [[slide guitar]], with Cooder as an influence.

"Furtado mixes Americana, folk, indie-rock, blues, and jazz styles."<ref>[http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=1001 "Tony Furtado goes for a lucky 'Thirteen'"] by Jason MacNeil, January 2007, ''Country Standard Time''</ref>

"As a banjo virtuoso, Furtado is well known for his envelope-pushing, progressive bluegrass stylings. His picking is rapid-fire quick, sharp and clear, and puts him in the school of Béla Fleck and [[David Grisman]]."<ref>[http://www.telluridegateway.com/articles/2007/03/09/the_pulse/pulse03.txt "Furtado brings eclectic bag of tricks to Opera House"] by Katie Klingsporn, March 8, 2007, ''Telluride Daily Planet''.</ref>

"He mixes bluegrass roots with a mainstream pop streak, easily holding the spotlight, thanks to his restrained virtuosity on acoustic and slide guitar and a warmly engaging voice reminiscent of T Bone Burnett, sans preachiness. – ''Paste'' magazine
