Her self-titled debut was released in November 2011 and her debut single was released in February 2012. She released her first music video titled "Suspicious Minds" on November 2, 2011 on CMT, Canada.

==Early life and education==
Leah Daniels grew up on a small farm in [[Uxbridge, Ontario|Uxbridge]], Ontario. Daniels was constantly surrounded by music and singing. She was introduced to music at an early age by a grandfather who taught her how to yodel and an uncle who schooled her in classic rock. She began to write songs at age 12 preferring music that incorporated a country pop music sound.

Daniels began performing as a young girl in choirs and singing competitions. Her first exposure to country music came at age 10 singing at the CNE Open Country singing contest. While attending school in [[Uxbridge, Ontario]] Leah began to perform in musicals. She performed roles as Eliza Doolittle in "[[My Fair Lady]]", Sandy in "[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]" and Anita in "[[West Side Story]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Boyce|first= Conrad|title=When Did They Grow Up?|newspaper= Uxbridge Cosmos|date= February 28, 2008}}</ref> Her first professional singing job was at a dinner theatre called, "Al Capone’s Birthday". Soon after this at age 18 Leah was hired to work as a singer/dancer in the shows "School of Rock" and "Twistin’ to the Sixties" at a theme park called Canada's Wonderland. Here Leah met and began to sing with the musicians who form her current band.

In 2005 Daniels studied musical theatre at Sheridan College and the following year she studied voice at Humber College. At this point in 2007 Leah left school to pursue her ambition of writing, recording and releasing her own original music. In 2008, she recorded and released her first 3-song Demo "No Escape". It was considered to be mostly pop/R&B but one song "Perfect World" stood out as almost having a country flavour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hayward|first= Jeff|title=Hey, hey Leah!: Uxbridge singer holds CD release party Saturday|newspaper=Uxbridge Times Journal |publisher=[[Metroland Media Group]]|date=February 28, 2008}}</ref> The positive feedback to "Perfect World" inspired Leah to focus on country music writing at this point.

==Career==
In 2010, Daniels began to perform regularly as a country artist. She won the Durham Region Music Award for Country Artist of the Year. She also performed at the [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] alongside such music legends as Dwight Yoakam and Tanya Tucker.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoult|first=Mark|url=http://www.communitypress.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2714972&archive=true|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115093743/http://www.communitypress.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2714972&archive=true|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2013|title=Country crooners vie for coveted jamboree spot|website=Communitypress.ca|date=August 19, 2010|accessdate=January 10, 2012}}</ref> She followed this with a September 2010 appearance in the New Artist Showcase at the 2010 CCMA Music Week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mills|first= Brandi|url=http://ccma.org/press_release.cfm?PressReleaseID=0201J44E5248A0441 |title=New Artist Showcase Line-Up Announced for Country Music Week 2010|publisher= [[Canadian Country Music Association]]|date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 10, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907093906/http://www.ccma.org/press_release.cfm?PressReleaseID=0201J44E5248A0441|archivedate=September 7, 2011|format=Press release}}</ref>
