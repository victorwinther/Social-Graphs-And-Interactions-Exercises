==Personal life==
Dalton has taken an interest in saving [[Nevada]]'s wild horses after she found some of them roaming around [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]]. In her "Mustang Messenger", Lacy's ''Let 'em Run Foundation'' newsletter she writes: <blockquote>...the New Year will find me attempting to view the restoration of horse slaughter for human consumption in some sort of light that will keep my head from exploding. Our wonderful vet here said 
"at least they won't be going to Mexico as much, where slaughter methods are unspeakable ... I was moved to write a song which we'll soon share with you on YouTube; for now, here are the lyrics: “''ODE TO SLAUGHTERHOUSE SUE AND THE BUTCHERIN’ CREW''”<ref>[http://www.letemrun.com/lerfdecember11nl.pdf Lacy's ''Let 'em Run Foundation''{{'}}s newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712020635/http://www.letemrun.com/lerfdecember11nl.pdf |date=2013-07-12 }}, retrieved and quoted with permission on June 1, 2013</ref><ref>See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.lacyjdalton.com/girlsdvd.htm|title=Lacy J.
