Riley later saw moderate country music chart action but never again duplicated the success of "Harper Valley PTA". She became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] in the mid-1970s and began recording gospel music during the late 1970s.

==Early life and rise to fame==
Riley was born in [[Anson, Texas]], United States.<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=343}}</ref> As a teenager, she married Mickey Riley and gave birth to a daughter, Kim Michelle Riley, on January 11, 1966.<ref name=Bio/> The family moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], after receiving a letter from [[Weldon Myrick]], who heard a demo tape of Riley's and believed she could be successful.<ref name=Bio/> Riley worked as a secretary for Passkey Music in Nashville while recording demos on the side.<ref name=Harper>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kanabel.com/jcrharpervalley.html|title=Jeannie C. Riley Harper Valley|date=26 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826032348/http://www.kanabel.com/jcrharpervalley.html|access-date=9 August 2021|archive-date=2006-08-26}}</ref>

Riley's career was stagnant until former [[Mercury Records]] producer [[Shelby Singleton]] received a [[demo tape]] of Riley's voice.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Singleton's fledgling label [[Plantation Records]] was starting to enjoy success. Seeing potential in the [[Tom T. Hall]] demo song "[[Harper Valley PTA]]", Singleton worked with Riley to record it.
<ref name=Harper/> The record quickly became one of the best-known country music songs of all time. Riley was the first woman to hold the Number 1 spot on the pop and country charts with the same song.<ref name=IMDB/>

==Success of "Harper Valley PTA"==
"[[Harper Valley PTA]]" was released in 1968 and immediately became a hit. It topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and [[Hot Country Songs]] charts,<ref name=Tarradell/> a feat not repeated by a female artist until [[Dolly Parton]]'s 1981 hit "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]". The song is about Mrs. Johnson, a [[widow]]ed woman who confronts members of the [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] after her daughter brings home a note from school critical of her mother's penchant for [[miniskirt]]s and dating various men. Mrs. Johnson turns the tables on the PTA and exposes its hypocrisy one member at a time, noting that their private behavior is far worse than hers.

Riley became an overnight sensation as the single earned her the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] and was named the [[Country Music Association]] Single of the Year. Riley also became one of the few country artists ever nominated in the major pop [[Grammy Award]] categories of "Best New Artist" and "Record of the Year".{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The single sold over five and a half million copies worldwide and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] just four weeks after its release. The album of the same name sold over one million units to earn Riley another gold record.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

The song's success helped Riley make country music history in 1969 as the first female vocalist to have her own major network variety special, ''Harper Valley U.S.A.'', which she hosted with [[Jerry Reed]]. The show featured performances by [[Mel Tillis]] and the song's writer, Tom T. Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455521/|title=Harper Valley, U.S.A. (1969)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-20}}</ref>

The song spawned a [[Harper Valley PTA (film)|1978 film]] and a [[Harper Valley PTA (TV series)|1981-82 television series]], both titled ''Harper Valley PTA'' and starring [[Barbara Eden]] as the widow Mrs. Johnson.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

==After "Harper Valley PTA"==

During the late 1960s and into the very early 1970s, Riley ranked among the most popular female vocalists in the country music industry. She had five [[Grammy Award]] nominations and four [[Country Music Association]] nominations, and performed a duet with [[Loretta Lynn]]. She had success on the country charts again, but on a lesser scale.

Other hits following "Harper Valley PTA" include "The Girl Most Likely," "There Never Was A Time," "The Rib," "The Back Side of Dallas," "Country Girl," "Oh Singer," and "Good Enough to Be Your Wife."<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Riley became known as much for her [[sex appeal]] and beauty as for her music, foreshadowing [[Shania Twain]] and other contemporary female vocalists by nearly three decades. At a time when many country queens were keeping a wholesome image by wearing [[gingham]] dresses, Riley kept in tune with typical late-1960s fashion by donning [[miniskirt]]s and [[go-go boots]] for her stage outfits (somewhat in the character of the protagonist in "PTA").<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  Her [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] persona opened doors (and perhaps started a sexual revolution) in country music, as hemlines of other female country artists' stage outfits began rising in the years that followed. But Riley was not comfortable with that image, and she eventually abandoned it for a more traditional wardrobe (floor-length gowns and ankle-length dresses typically worn by other female country artists).  In the 1993 CBS documentary, ''The Woman of Country'', she noted that during the "Harper Valley" period, her publicist and manager were largely responsible for creating and playing up her sexy image (matching the character pictured on the "Harper Valley" album cover).

==Late 1970s and the 1980s==
Riley's success brought a number of offers from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], and she appeared with [[Bing Crosby]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Ed Sullivan]] and others on various television programs.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0727064/|title=Jeannie C. Riley|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-20}}</ref>

Riley left Plantation Records for [[MGM Records]] in 1972, recording several albums, but only two of her singles from the period, "Good Morning Country Rain" and "Give Myself A Party," cracked the top 30.  Later stints at [[Mercury Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]] produced only a couple of charted singles, but she remained in demand as a concert artist well into the 1980s.

Riley became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and began recording [[gospel music]] in the mid-1970s.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, Brien. [http://www.texnews.com/1998/2000/local/riley0812.html 'Harper Valley' singer finds strength in faith.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612183029/http://www.texnews.com/1998/2000/local/riley0812.html |date=2008-06-12 }} ''[[Abilene Reporter-News]]'', August 12, 2000. Retrieved 2008-02-09.</ref> As result of her conversion, she distanced herself from "PTA" for a time due to its content. The song remained part of her live set, however, and she still performs it in her shows. She published her 1980 [[autobiography]], ''From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top,'' which told the story of pop-music stardom and later move to [[gospel music]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Riley released a gospel album with the same title in 1981.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

==Personal life==
Jeannie and Mickey Riley divorced in 1970 at the height of her career.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Following her shift from country music to gospel, they remarried in 1975 and settled in [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]], [[Tennessee]]. After the release of her autobiography, ''From Harper Valley to the Mountaintop'', and a gospel album of the same name in 1980, she suffered a bout of depression and was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. The Rileys divorced again in 1991. Two years later, Mickey moved back in to help Jeannie battle depression&mdash;an arrangement that continued until he remarried three years later. Jeannie married Billy Starnes, a childhood friend, in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://roundtop.com/culture/jeannie-c-rileys-road-to-love/|title=Country Singer Jeannie C.

Riley sued Big Lots' parent company, Consolidated Stores Corporation, for $250,000 in 2003 after suffering from a fall the previous year. Riley stated that injuries from the fall kept her from performing and resulted in lasting disability.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Staff 7/17/2003|first=CMT com|title=Riley Sues Store Over Injury|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1474144/riley-sues-store-over-injury/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130084337/http://www.cmt.com/news/1474144/riley-sues-store-over-injury/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 30, 2020|access-date=2021-11-04|website=CMT News}}</ref>

Note: The single of "Things Go Better With Love" and "The Back Side of Dallas" seems to have been published in several different formats. Some label "Things Go Better..." as the A side while others do not letter the sides. One photo available online of an unlettered single has the "Back Side ..." side stamped "PLUG SIDE". Evidently the label changed its mind at least once about which side to promote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Jeannie-C-Riley-The-Back-Side-Of-Dallas/release/9304448|title=Jeannie C.
