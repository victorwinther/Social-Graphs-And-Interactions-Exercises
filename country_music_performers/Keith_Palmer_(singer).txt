'''Keith Palmer''' (June 23, 1957 – June 13, 1996)<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|author=Joel Whitburn|authorlink=Joel Whitburn|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=314|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> was an American [[country music]] artist. He was born Bryon Keith Palmer on June 23, 1957, in [[Hayti, Missouri]], United States, and was raised in [[Corning, Arkansas]]. His name was actually supposed to be "Byron", but there was a mistake on the birth certificate.

He began his music career in 1975 as pianist for [[the Dixie Echoes]], where he remained for three years. In 1991, Palmer released an album for [[Epic Records]] which produced two singles: "Don't Throw Me in the Briarpatch" and "Forgotten but Not Gone", both of which entered the U.S. Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart (now [[Hot Country Songs]]). He also co-wrote [[Reba McEntire]]'s 1991 single "[[For My Broken Heart (song)|For My Broken Heart]]". Palmer died of cancer on June 13, 1996, in [[White House, Tennessee]], at age 38.
