'''Lionel Burke Cartwright''' (born February 10, 1960) is an American [[country music]] artist. Between 1988 and 1992, Cartwright charted twelve singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts, including a {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 single in 1991's "[[Leap of Faith (Lionel Cartwright song)|Leap of Faith]]". He also charted in the Top 10 on the same chart with "Give Me His Last Chance", "I Watched It All (On My Radio)" and "My Heart is Set on You". Cartwright has also released three studio albums, all on [[MCA Records]].

==Biography==
Cartwright was born in [[Gallipolis, Ohio]], but was raised in [[Glen Dale, West Virginia]]. Cartwright was interested in music from an early age. He first took piano lessons as a child, before going on to master guitar and eight other instruments.<ref>[http://www.moodybluegrass.com/artists.html Moody Bluegrass]</ref> Lionel first performed publicly at age ten in community gatherings.<ref name="allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1547/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Lionel Cartwright > Biography )))]</ref> He also went on to serve as performer, arranger and musical director on [[Spike TV|The Nashville Network]]'s musical [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] ''[[I 40 Paradise]]'' and ''Pickin' at the Paradise''.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Later on, Cartwright moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and worked as a demo singer.<ref>[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Lionel-Cartwright.html Lionel Cartwright biography: OLDIES.com]</ref> He was eventually spotted by [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], a producer at [[MCA Records]], while performing in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Brown thought that Cartwright needed more experience before being signed to a record deal, and by 1986, Cartwright was signed to MCA.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Cartwright's [[Lionel Cartwright (album)|self-titled]] debut album was released in 1989 under the production of [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]]. Lead-off single "You're Gonna Make Her Mine" charted at No.&nbsp;45 on the country charts, followed by three straight Top 20 hits: "Like Father, Like Son" at No.&nbsp;14, "Give Me His Last Chance" at No.&nbsp;3 and "In My Eyes" at No.&nbsp;12.<ref name="allmusic"/> Cartwright wrote nine of the album's ten songs, and played [[guitar]], [[fiddle]], [[piano]] and [[mandolin]] on it.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Lionel Cartwright |others=Lionel Cartwright |year=1989 |type=CD booklet |publisher=MCA Records |id=MCAD-42276}}</ref>

In 1990, Lionel received a nomination for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist of the Year]] by the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], alongside [[Clint Black]] and [[Garth Brooks]], losing to Black.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1990/BB-1990-03-10.pdf|title=ACM Names Awards Nominees|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=11, 101|date=March 10, 1990}}</ref>

His next album, ''[[I Watched It on the Radio]]'', followed in 1990. It was led off by the No.&nbsp;8 "I Watched It All (On My Radio)", which he co-wrote with [[Don Schlitz]]. After it came the No.&nbsp;7 "My Heart Is Set on You" and No.&nbsp;31 "Say It's Not True". The album was also his highest peak on [[Top Country Albums]], at No.&nbsp;21. Brown produced this album as well.

''[[Chasin' the Sun]]'' was the title of his third and final MCA release, which was issued in 1991. Unlike with his first two albums, Cartwright worked with several producers and studio musicians. Although the album produced his only No.&nbsp;1 country hit in its lead-off single "Leap of Faith", the other two singles were not as successful: "What Kind of Fool" reached No.&nbsp;24 and "Family Tree" missed the Top 40, with a No.&nbsp;62 peak. After the latter, he charted two more singles ("Be My Angel" and "Standing on the Promises") which were never included on an album, and left MCA in 1992. He wrote "If That's What You Call Love" on [[Kathy Mattea]]'s 1997 album ''[[Love Travels]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/love-travels-mw0000080698 |title=Love Travels by Kathy Mattea on AllMusic |website=[[AllMusic]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503132505/http://www.allmusic.com/album/love-travels-mw0000080698 |archivedate=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2013-02-01 }}</ref> a song which also featured him on piano and background vocals.<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media notes |title=Love Travels |others=Kathy Mattea |year=1997 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Mercury Nashville |id=314 532 899 2}}</ref>

Since exiting MCA, Cartwright has composed themes for television series, including ''[[30 Minute Meals]]''. By 2013, he had become worship pastor at HopePark Church in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hopepark.com/lionel-cartwright/ |title=HopePark/Lionel Cartwright |url-status=dead |accessdate=2013-02-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131034236/http://www.hopepark.com/lionel-cartwright/ |archivedate=2013-01-31 }}</ref>
