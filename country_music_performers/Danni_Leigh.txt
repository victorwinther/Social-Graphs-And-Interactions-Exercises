Leigh has also performed a number of small gigs in the [[Austin, Texas]], area,<ref name="Bombs Over Baghdad">{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A226212|title=Bombs Over Baghdad|accessdate=February 3, 2008|date=August 27, 2004|author=Christopher Gray|work=The Austin Chronicle}}</ref> where she moved in 2002.<ref name="Immigrant Song">{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:104026|title=Immigrant Song|accessdate=February 3, 2008|date=October 4, 2002|author=John T.

As her career declined in the US, Leigh later moved again, this time to Spain, many years later and performed elsewhere in Europe and Asia. She even reached the rest of South America. During the tours, she met and eventually married her bandmate Mike McKenzie.<ref name=WinchesterStar/> The couple returned to Nashville in order to restart her career, but the birth of her only child, a son, in 2010 led her to emphasize both motherhood and becoming a businessperson. Leigh then moved with her husband back to [[Strasburg, Virginia]], her birthplace, where she started her boutique-cum-fitness studio in 2018 and opened another in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].<ref name=WinchesterStar/>
