'''Julienne Irwin''' (born March 14, 1993) is an American [[singing|singer]] from [[Bel Air, Maryland]]. Irwin was a finalist on the [[America's Got Talent (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

==Biography==
Prior to her ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' debut, Irwin has stated she has never performed publicly or received any vocal lessons. According to her bio on the [[NBC]] website, Irwin attended Harford [[Christianity|Christian]] School where she was a [[cheerleader]] and became the [[class president]]. She is also said to want to sing the [[national anthem]] at [[Camden Yards]], the home of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].

Irwin is a very devoted [[country music]] fan. In her own words, on her public website, she states:
<blockquote>
I live for country music. If it didn't exist, a huge piece of my life would be missing. It wakes me up in the morning and puts me to sleep at night, and it's on my mind 24 hours a day.<ref name="JIrwinMusic">{{cite web

She also values her education:
<blockquote>
School is such an integral part of my life. I really think it has molded me into who I am today.<ref name="JIrwinMusic"/>

===2007: ''America's Got Talent''===
As in the previous year, the show consisted of a nationwide search, through thousands of applicants all competing for the top one million dollar prize.

Irwin first auditioned in [[New York City|New York]], with an a cappella rendition of "[[How Do I Live]]" ([[LeAnn Rimes]]) by [[Diane Warren]].<ref>{{cite web

<blockquote>
.Julienne, I still don't think you've done enough to win, but I've gotta say, that was a brilliant performance.  And I think if America gives votes for people that make me look stupid, you're going to get lots of votes.

The "Season Finale" was about entertainment, performance reviews and announcement of results.  Irwin performed "[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]" with the famous country singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  After the song, Swift was asked, based on her experience as a teenage Country Music singer, what advice she would offer to Irwin.  In reply, Swift commented:
<blockquote>
... She [Irwin] has such an adorable personality, and that's so much of the battle right there.  You know, being so endearing and so so humble.  I think she should just stay who she is.  I think she's got it.

</blockquote>

Afterward, a prerecorded message was played from four-time [[Country Music Association|CMA]] and three-time [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]] Female Vocalist of the Year winner, [[Martina McBride]].  In it she said:
<blockquote>
I just want to take this chance to let you know that I'm really impressed with your [Irwin's] singing.  You have a great voice. It's wonderful to watch you. As a matter of fact, watching you brings back a lot of memories of myself singing when I was your age...
  <ref name="AGTSeasonFin"/>
</blockquote>

It was later announced that Irwin was the first contestant eliminated of the final four.

==Career==
On September 9, 2007, Julienne Irwin got to live her dream of singing the national anthem at Camden Yards, as reported in the September 10, 2007 issue of the Baltimore Sun.  In the words of Sun reporter, John-John Williams IV:
<blockquote>

Before she performed, the Bel Air resident showed signs of a typical awe-struck teenager. Her jaw dropped after a brief conversation with Orioles starter Melvin Mora.

"Oh my gosh!" she mouthed to her father, Felix "Phil" Irwin.

When it was time to perform, Julienne displayed the poise and maturity that captured fans this summer. The words of the anthem flowed with the clarity and strength of a professional. Julienne later said she was a bundle of nerves inside.<ref name="Camden Yards">{{cite news|last=Williams|first=John-John|date=2007-09-10|title=She's got talent -- and hometown pride, too|work=The Baltimore Sun|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/bal-md.irwin10sep10,0,5727159.story|access-date=2007-10-15}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

</blockquote>

The story goes on to say that Julienne is settling into life as a student. She began her freshman year at Harford Christian School in Darlington earlier that week.

On September 23, 2007, Julienne Irwin's singing once again brought her to the national stage.  She was invited to sing the national anthem to a crowd of 140,000 spectators at the Dodge Dealers 400, at Dover International Speedway, as televised on ABC to a nationwide audience.<ref>{{cite press release

<blockquote>
A little over two months ago, for my 15th birthday, I went into the recording studio (for the first time ever!!!) to record some demos. Four of which were new songs, written for me, and the final two were a full version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" and "Fields of Gold".<ref name="JIrwinMusic2">{{cite web
