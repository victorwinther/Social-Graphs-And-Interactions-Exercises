==Biography==
During the 1970s, Van Zant performed with his first band, the Austin Nickels Band. They later changed their name to [[The Johnny Van Zant Band]] releasing their debut solo album, ''[[No More Dirty Deals]]'', in 1980. Early members of the Johnny Van Zant Band consisted of Van Zant on lead vocals, Robbie Gay on guitar, Danny Clausman, on bass, Erik Lundgren on lead guitar, Robbie Morris, drums and [[Joan Hecht]] (previously Joan Cusimano) and Nancy Henderson on background vocals. Van Zant released three more solo albums between 1981 and 1985, before taking a break from the music business.

He became lead vocalist and chief songwriter for the reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987 and continues to record and perform with them today. He released another solo album, ''Brickyard Road'', in 1990, which featured the popular title track, which was a #1 hit on the U.S. [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for three weeks. He also records and performs with his brother, Donnie, as [[Van Zant (band)|Van Zant]] since 1998. Van Zant and Lynyrd Skynyrd performed in Arizona on April 9, 2022, during Arizona Bike Week at WestWorld of Scottsdale. He stated that original member [[Gary Rossington]] was recovering and still needed prayers.

In May 2006, less than one day before he was to perform at [[KSAN (FM)|KSAN-FM]] 107.7 ''The Bone's Bone Bash 7'', Van Zant underwent emergency surgery to have his [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] removed. Treated at [[Stanford University Medical Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], after reporting pain to a doctor earlier in the day.
