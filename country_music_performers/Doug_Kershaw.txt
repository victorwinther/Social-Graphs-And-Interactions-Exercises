'''Douglas James Kershaw''' (born January 24, 1936<ref name="fiddle" /><ref name="McCall-p263" />) is an American [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]] player, singer and songwriter from [[Louisiana]]. Active since 1948, he began his career as part of the duo [[Rusty and Doug]], along with his brother, [[Rusty Kershaw]]. He had an extensive solo career that included fifteen albums and singles that charted on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. He is also a member of the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]], being inducted in 2009.

== Early life ==
Born in an unincorporated community called Tiel Ridge in [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron Parish]], Kershaw spoke [[Louisiana French]] and did not learn English until the age of eight. By that time, he had mastered the fiddle, which he played from the age of five, and was on his way to teaching himself to play 28 instruments.<ref name = "CMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529012212/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |title=Doug Kershaw Bio |publisher=Cmt.com |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref> His first gig was at a local bar, the Bucket of Blood, where he was accompanied by his mother on guitar.<ref name="LouisianaRocks">{{cite book|last1=Aswell|first1=Tom|title=Louisiana Rocks!: The True Genesis of Rock and Roll|date=2013|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781455607839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSHTGsnI8skC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22Bucket+of+Blood%22&pg=PA222|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>

Kershaw became interested in Cajun music during parties his parents would host on the family's [[houseboat]] in Louisiana, where he first heard Cajun bands playing the music.

=="Doug and Rusty"==
Doug grew up surrounded by [[Cajun music|Cajun]] fiddle and [[accordion]] music. After teaching his brother, Rusty, to play guitar, he formed a band, the Continental Playboys, with Rusty and older brother Nelson "Peewee" Kershaw in 1948.<ref name="LouisianaRocks"/> With the departure of Peewee from the group, in the early 1950s, [[Rusty & Doug]] continued to perform as a duo. In 1955, when Kershaw was nineteen, he and Rusty performed on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' [[KWKH]] radio broadcast in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana.<ref name="Stabler-p233">{{cite book|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|edition=3rd|page=233|isbn=978-0312264871}}</ref> The two also performed at the WWVA Jamboree (later renamed [[Jamboree U.S.A.]]), in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], West Virginia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dregni|first1=Michael|title=Rockabilly: The Twang Heard 'Round the World: The Illustrated History|date=2011|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9780760340622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06VWZ69WBAEC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22WWVA+jamboree%22&pg=PA144|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>

Although the brothers initially sang in French, [[J. D. "Jay" Miller]], owner of the [[Feature Records]] label, persuaded them to incorporate songs in English into their repertoire. In 1955, Doug and Rusty recorded their first single, "So Lovely, Baby." Released on the Hickory label, the tune went to number 14 on the country music charts. Later that same year, Doug and Rusty were invited to become members of the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' cast. The Kershaws appeared at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and became regular members of the Opry cast the following year.<ref name = "CMT" /><ref>{{cite web

Despite the demands of his music career, Doug enrolled in [[McNeese State University]], in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], where he earned an [[undergraduate degree]] in Mathematics. At the peak of their early career, in 1958, Doug and Rusty both enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. They devoted their attention to the military until their discharge three years later.<ref name="LouisianaRocks"/>

== "Louisiana Man" and solo career ==
After fulfilling their military obligation, the two brothers recorded "[[Louisiana Man]]", an autobiographical song that Doug had written while in the Army. The song not only sold millions of copies but over the years has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music.<ref name="Woodstra-p255">{{cite book|last=Woodstra|first=Chris|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings|publisher=Backbeat Books|edition=1st|year=1997|page=255|isbn=978-0879304751}}</ref> The song was eventually [[cover version|covered]] by more than 800 artists.

There were three albums released by the duo on [[Hickory Records]], only one being released before they split up. The first was ''Rusty and Doug Sing Louisiana Man'' (LPM 103) in 1961. ''Kershaw (Genus Cambarus)'' (LPS 163) was released in 1972 and was a double LP. ''Louisiana Man'' (HR 4506) was the final Hickory album, released in 1974. By 1964, the brothers had elected to go their separate ways. It took another three years before Kershaw signed a songwriters' contract with BMI, in 1967.

In June 1969, Kershaw made his first network television appearance on the debut of the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash Show]]''.<ref name="LouisianaRocks"/> After watching Kershaw's ''Johnny Cash Show'' performance as an eight-year-old boy, [[Mark O'Connor]] became inspired to learn to play the fiddle.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/11/19/mark-oconnors-art-fiddling-with-the-best/ad489226-573c-4281-b521-c7aff4a63e5a/ |title=Mark O'Connor's Art: Fiddling With The Best |author=Himes, Geoffrey |work=washingtonpost.com |access-date=5 May 2022 }}</ref> He capped the year with a week-long engagement at the New York City's [[Fillmore East]] as opening act for [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Derek and the Dominos]]. While it seemed to many rock and pop fans that Kershaw had appeared out of nowhere, he had already sold more than 18 million copies of the records he had made in the early '60s with his brother, Rusty. "Louisiana Man" had been a Top 10 country hit in 1961 and its follow-up, "Diggy Liggy Lo", had done almost as well. His performance in front of a national audience led to [[Warner Bros. Records]] signing him to a long-term contract.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard De La Font Agency, Inc: Doug Kershaw|url=http://delafont.com/music_acts/E/doug-kershaw.htm|publisher=Delafont.com|access-date=2014-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709010841/http://delafont.com/music_acts/E/doug-kershaw.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 1969, he performed at the Newport folk festival along with Joni Mitchell, Arlo Guthrie, Ramblin Jack Elliott, Big Mama Thornton, and Mimi Fariña, among others. Newcomers that year were Don McLean, James Taylor, and Jerry Jeff Walker. In November 1969, "Louisiana Man"  was broadcast back to Earth by the crew of the [[Apollo 12]] Moon mission.<ref>{{cite news|title=Born on the Bayou: Exploring Louisiana in 18 Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/born-on-the-bayou-exploring-louisiana-in-18-songs-20120611|access-date=21 August 2017|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=11 June 2012}}</ref> Beyond the southern venues, Kershaw became widely known in mainstream America as he played at major urban concert halls.

In 1970, Kershaw contributed a violin part to Arlo Guthrie's [[Single (music)|record single]] "[[Alice's Restaurant|Alice's Rock and Roll Restaurant]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Arlo-Guthrie-Alices-Rock-And-Roll-Restaurant-Ring-Around-A-Rosy-Rag/release/2544222 |title=Arlo Guthrie - Alice's Rock And Roll Restaurant / Ring-Around-A-Rosy Rag (Vinyl) |publisher=[[Discogs]] |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref>

In 1971, Kershaw had an acting and musical cameo in the [[Western (genre)|Western film]] ''[[Zachariah (1971 film)|Zachariah]]'', starring [[Don Johnson]] and [[John Rubinstein]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|author-link=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}</ref>

Kershaw's playing was featured in the [[Richard Brooks]] 1971 film ''[[Dollars (film)|Dollars]]''.

In 1972, Kershaw played electric fiddle in Grand Funk's "Flight of the Phoenix" off their LP ''Phoenix''. Capitol SMAS 11099<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Grand-Funk-Phoenix/release/1441635 |title=Grand Funk* - Phoenix (Vinyl, LP, Album) |publisher=[[Discogs]] |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref>

== Later life ==
Despite the success of his solo career, Kershaw was plagued by depression and [[sadness|sorrow]]. His father had committed suicide when he was only seven.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Tanya|title=100 Ways to Beat the Blues: An Uplifting Book for Anyone Who's Down|date=May 11, 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0602-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6REhl5DWDwwC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+suicide&pg=PA61|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> Marrying his wife, Pam, at the [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]] on June 21, 1975, Kershaw began raising his own family that included five sons – Douglas, Victor, Zachary, Tyler, and Elijah; and two grandsons and a granddaughter. His son Tyler plays drums in his band, and manages his shows as well.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doug Kershaw and Steve Riley|url=http://fqfi.org/frenchquarter/artists/detail/674/Doug-Kershaw-and-Steve-Riley|access-date=21 August 2017|publisher=French Quarter|archive-date=August 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822020703/http://fqfi.org/frenchquarter/artists/detail/674/Doug-Kershaw-and-Steve-Riley|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1978, Kershaw appeared briefly as a fiddler in the film ''[[Days of Heaven]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Days of Heaven – Full Cast & Crew |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/days-of-heaven/cast/2030112469/ |website=[[TV Guide]] |access-date=14 September 2022}}</ref>

Kershaw rebounded with his biggest selling hit, "Hello Woman", which reached the country music Top 40. By 1984, Kershaw's battle with [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol abuse]] came to a close and his previously erratic behavior changed for the better.<ref name="CMT" />

In 1988, he recorded a duet, "[[Cajun Baby]]", with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]],<ref name="LouisianaRocks" /> that became a Top 50 country hit. Kershaw released a French-language album, ''Two Step Fever'', in 1999, and Michael Doucet of Beausoleil is featured on the duet "Fievre De Deux Etapes". ''Hot Diggity Doug'' was released in mid-2000 and ''Still Cajun After All These Years'' followed in early 2001.  His brother Rusty died on October 23, 2001.<ref name="cmt-rusty">{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Edward|title=CMT: Rusty Kershaw, of Rusty & Doug, Dead at 63|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1450284/rusty-kershaw-of-rusty-doug-dead-at-63.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117022900/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1450284/rusty-kershaw-of-rusty-doug-dead-at-63.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 17, 2012|publisher=Cmt.com|date=October 23, 2001|access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref>

Kershaw formerly owned and operated The Bayou House, a restaurant in Lucerne, Colorado, but parted ways with his partners in 2007 due to his displeasure with management and ambiance.<ref name="greeley">{{cite web|first=Kyle|last=Haas|url=http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20080528/BUSINESS/642059053|title=Bayou House closes its doors|publisher=Greeley Tribune|date=May 28, 2008|access-date=2010-01-27}}</ref>

== Notes ==
:1.{{note|a}} This recording of "Louisiana Sun" dates from the 1960s, and likely features an uncredited [[Rusty Kershaw]].
:2.{{note|b}} Promo copies exist with a re-recording of the song as "Don't Mess With My Popeye's", done specially for the fast food chain.
