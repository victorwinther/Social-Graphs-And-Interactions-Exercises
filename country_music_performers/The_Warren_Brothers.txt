'''The Warren Brothers''' are an American [[country music]] duo composed of brothers Brett Warren (lead vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica, [[mandolin]], piano) and Brad Warren (background vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar).<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=King of Nothing |title-link=King of Nothing |others=The Warren Brothers |year=2000 |publisher=BNA Records |id=BNA07863-67903-2}}</ref> The duo has released three [[studio album]]s: ''Beautiful Day in the Cold Cruel World'' (1998) and ''King of Nothing'' (2000) on [[BNA Records]], as well as ''[[Well Deserved Obscurity]]'' (2004) on Sig/429 and a 2005 compilation album, ''Barely Famous Hits''. These four albums have produced nine charting [[single (music)|singles]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, with the highest being "Move On" at No.&nbsp;17 in late 2000-early 2001. Brad and Brett have also co-written songs for [[Taylor Swift]], [[Dierks Bentley]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Martina McBride]].

== History ==
Brad and Brett Warren grew up in [[Tampa, Florida]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=449|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> They previously headlined local Christian heavy metal bands including a [[Christian rock]] heavy metal band called St. Warren. They moved from Florida to [[Nashville]] in 1995.<ref name="whitburn"/>

The duo signed to [[BNA Records]] in 1997 and released its debut album, ''Beautiful Day in the Cold Cruel World'', in late 1998. This album produced three [[single (music)|singles]]: "Guilty," "Better Man", and "She Wants to Rock," all of which charted within the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Pemberton Roach of [[Allmusic]] rated the album four stars out of five, comparing its sound to that of "slick, roots-influenced pop artists like [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] and [[Glenn Frey]]" and saying that such a sound "avoid[s] any trace of Nashville clichés in favor of honest, straightforward lyrics and energetic, polished playing."<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r380176|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Beautiful Day in the Cold Cruel World'' review|last=Roach|first=Pemberton|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref> Following the release of this album, The Warren Brothers toured with [[Tim McGraw]] and his wife, [[Faith Hill]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p350399/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Warren Brothers biography|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref>

In September 2000, the duo released its second album, ''King of Nothing''.<ref name="allmusic"/> Its first single release was the No.&nbsp;22 "That's the Beat of a Heart," which featured a guest vocal from [[Sara Evans]] and was included on the [[soundtrack]] to the 2000 film ''[[Where the Heart Is (2000 film)|Where the Heart Is]]''.<ref name="whitburn"/> The second single from ''King of Nothing'' was the duo's highest-peaking single, the No.&nbsp;17 "Move On,"<ref name="whitburn"/> and finishing off the single releases was the No.&nbsp;33 "Where Does It Hurt."

A seventh single, "Hey Mr. President", was released in 2003, peaking at No.&nbsp;28. Following it were the non-album single "Break the Record" and two separate releases of "Sell a Lot of Beer," on which McGraw sang [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]].<ref name="whitburn"/> This latter song was included on the duo's third studio album, 2004's ''Well Deserved Obscurity''. A compilation entitled ''Barely Famous Hits'' followed in 2005, and the same year, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] signed the brothers to their own [[reality television]] series called ''Barely Famous: The Warren Brothers''. They were also dropped from BNA in 2005. The brothers served as judges for one season of the talent competition ''[[Nashville Star]]'' as well.

==Songwriting careers==
In the latter half of the 2000s, the duo began writing songs for other artists. Hill released two of the duo's co-writes as singles: "[[The Lucky One (Faith Hill song)|The Lucky One]]" in 2006, and "[[Red Umbrella]]" in 2007. Also, that year, McGraw performed "[[If You're Reading This]]" at the [[Academy of Country Music]] awards and released that song as a single after radio stations began playing a [[Broadcasting|telecast]] of the song.<ref name="gac2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5560359,00.html |title=News: Headlines: Tim McGraw Song Remains TV Moment |access-date=February 5, 2010 |work=[[Great American Country]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123220835/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5560359,00.html |archive-date=January 23, 2013 }}</ref>

[[Martina McBride]] released two Warren Brothers co-writes from her 2007 album ''[[Waking Up Laughing]]'': "[[Anyway (Martina McBride song)|Anyway]]" and "[[How I Feel (Martina McBride song)|How I Feel]]," the former of which was also the first co-writer's credit of her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qcknightnews.com/2.10350/martina-mcbride-will-keep-you-up-singing-with-waking-up-laughing-1.1376891 |title=Martina McBride Will Keep You Up Singing With Waking Up Laughing |last=Papadatos |first=Markos |date=May 16, 2007 |work=The Knight News |access-date=February 5, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> McBride released a third Warren Brothers song, "[[Wrong Baby Wrong Baby Wrong|Wrong Baby Wrong]]," in January 2010.
