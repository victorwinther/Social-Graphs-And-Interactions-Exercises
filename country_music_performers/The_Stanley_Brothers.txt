'''The Stanley Brothers''' were an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] duo of singer-songwriters and musicians, made up of brothers [[Carter Stanley]] (August 27, 1925 – December 1, 1966) and [[Ralph Stanley]] (February 25, 1927 – June 23, 2016).<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=Colin Larkin|publisher=Guinness Publishing|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=2361/2}}</ref> Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo artist after Carter's death, from 1967 until his own death in 2016.

==Early lives==
Carter and Ralph Stanley were born on a small farm in [[Dickenson County, Virginia]]. Music was a part of their lives even in their early years, and they listened to the [[Bill Monroe|Monroe Brothers]], [[J. E. Mainer|J.&nbsp;E. Mainer's Mountaineers]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on local radio.

==Careers==
The brothers formed a band, the Lazy Ramblers, and performed as a duo on [[WJCW|WJHL]] radio in Johnson City, Tennessee.<ref name="country_music">{{cite book |title= Country Music: The Encyclopedia| edition= 3rd |last= Stambler|first= Irwin|author2=Grelun Landon |year= 2000|publisher= St. Martin's Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-312-26487-9|pages= 457–8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C|access-date= February 6, 2010}}</ref> World War II interrupted their musical career, but once both brothers returned from the United States Army, they resumed their musical pursuits. They formed their band, the Stanley Brothers and the [[Clinch Mountain Boys]], in the month of November 1946<ref>Back of 33rpm album cover "In Memory of Carter Stanley/ An Empty Mansion by The Stanley Brothers. Testimonial story by Ralph Stanley. Old Homestead Records OHCS 118.</ref> as the first band to copy the [[Bill Monroe|Monroe sound]].<ref name=mmc426>Malone, McCulloh 1975, p.&nbsp;426.</ref> Carter played guitar and sang lead, while Ralph played [[banjo]] and sang with a strong, high [[tenor]] voice. Additional members of this early band were [[Pee Wee Lambert|Darrell "Pee Wee" Lambert]] on [[mandolin]] and Bobby Sumner on [[fiddle]]. Sumner soon was replaced by [[Leslie Keith]].<ref name=r80>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;80.</ref>

On December 26, 1946, the band began performing at radio station [[WZAP|WCYB]] in Bristol, Tennessee as stalwarts of the famed ''Farm and Fun Time'' radio show.<ref name=w3>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;3.</ref> They made their recording debut in September 1947 for [[Rich-R-Tone Records]] which had been founded the year before. Their records sold well, "outselling even [[Eddy Arnold]]" regionally.<ref name=r82>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;82.</ref> Up to now, Ralph had been playing his banjo with two fingers on recordings and in concerts, but in 1948, he switched to the three-finger style (popularised by [[Earl Scruggs]]).<ref name=r84>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;84.</ref> In March 1949, the Stanley Brothers began recording for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=r87>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;87.</ref> During this time, [[Bill Monroe]] was not particularly fond of groups like the Stanley Brothers and [[Flatt & Scruggs]] who he believed "stole" his music by copying it; they were seen as "economic threats."<ref name=s88>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;88.</ref><ref name=r85>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>

Financially hard times in the early 1950s forced the brothers to take a short break in their musical career. They began working for the [[Ford Motor Company]] in Detroit. Eventually, Monroe and the Stanley Brothers became friends, and Carter performed for several months with Bill Monroe in the summer of 1951. In August 1951, Ralph was involved in a serious automobile accident that almost ended his career.<ref name=w4>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Following his recovery, Carter and Ralph reunited to front their Clinch Mountain Boys.

As bluegrass music grew less popular in the late 1950s, the Stanley Brothers moved to Live Oak, Florida and headlined the weekly ''Suwannee River Jamboree'' radio show on [[WQHL (AM)|WNER]] from 1958 to 1962. The three-hour show was also syndicated across the Southeast.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> In 1966, the brothers toured Europe, and upon returning home, they continued to perform together until Carter's death in December 1966.<ref name=w5>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;5.</ref>

Many years later, Ralph revived the Clinch Mountain Boys until his death in 2016. He performed with them through 2013. He recorded one last album in 2014, ''Side By Side'', with his son, Ralph II. Among the musicians who have played in the revived Clinch Mountain Boys were [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Larry Sparks]], [[Curly Ray Cline]], Jack Cooke, Roy Lee Centers, Charlie Sizemore, Ray Goins, and Ralph Stanley II. Ralph's career received a big boost with his prominent role on the very successful soundtrack recording of the 2000 feature film, ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', which featured the song "[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]" among others.

==Legacy==
The Stanley Brothers were inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] in 1992. In 2005, The Barter State Theatre of Virginia premiered an original stage production, ''Man of Constant Sorrow: The Story of the Stanley Brothers'', written by Dr. Douglas Pote.

The University Press of Mississippi published the first full-length biography of the Stanley Brothers, ''Lonesome Melodies: The Lives and Music of the Stanley Brothers'' by David W. Johnson, on February 1, 2013. The paperback edition was published March 1, 2014.
