==Career==
In 2004, Fairchild signed to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Her first album, ''[[Ride (Shelly Fairchild album)|Ride]]'', was issued in early 2005. Its lead-off single, "You Don't Lie Here Anymore", co-written with Clay Mills, peaked at No.&nbsp;35 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, although subsequent singles failed to chart. She toured in support of the album including an opening spot on [[Rascal Flatts]]' sold-out ''Here's to You'' tour which also featured [[Blake Shelton]], but was dropped from Columbia by the end of the year.

In 2008, Fairchild signed a record deal with [[Stroudavarious Records]] which was founded by producer [[James Stroud]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/audio/shelly-fairchild-its-all-gonna-work-out|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106212430/http://www.roughstock.com/audio/shelly-fairchild-its-all-gonna-work-out|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2009|title=Shelly Fairchild — "It's All Gonna Work Out"|work=Roughstock|accessdate=January 5, 2009}}</ref> Her first release was the song "It's All Gonna Work Out", which she released for a charity album called ''We Are Enterprise''.

She co-wrote a song called "Love Everybody", which was an anchor for this record.<ref name="Shelly Fairchild — Sip Magazine">{{cite web|url=https://thesipmag.com/shelly-fairchild/|title=Shelly Fairchild |author=Lauchlin Fields |date=November 2, 2015|work=The 'Sip |accessdate=October 5, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, Fairchild was one of three background singers for [[Martina McBride]]'s "Everlasting Tour". Touring with McBride, Fairchild explained, was a huge highlight of her career.

Martina is somebody I’ve looked up to as a singer my whole life."<ref name="Shelly Fairchild — Sip Magazine"/>
