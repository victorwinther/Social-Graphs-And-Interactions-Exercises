==Biography==
Shaver was born in [[Corsicana, Texas]], and raised by his mother, Victory Watson Shaver. Until he was 12, he spent a great deal of time with his grandmother in Corsicana, so his mother could work in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]. He sometimes accompanied his mother to her job at a local nightclub, where he was first exposed to country music.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol17/issue49/music.shaver.html |title=The Christian Life |website=Austinchronicle.com |date=March 23, 2012 |access-date=February 24, 2013}}</ref>

Shaver's mother remarried about the time that his grandmother died, and Shaver and his older sister Patricia moved in with their mother and new stepfather. Shaver left school after the eighth grade to help his uncles pick cotton, but occasionally returned to school to play sports.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Cite web|url=http://www.texicanmusic.com/pearlbio.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230160237/http://www.texicanmusic.com/pearlbio.htm|url-status=dead|title=texicanmusic.com|archive-date=December 30, 2006|website=Texicanmusic.com}}</ref>

Shaver joined the [[U.S. Navy]] on his 17th birthday.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Friskics-Warren |first=Bill |date=2020-10-29 |title=Billy Joe Shaver, Outlaw Singer and Songwriter, Dies at 81 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/arts/music/billy-joe-shaver-dead.html |access-date=2024-03-16 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Upon his discharge, he worked a series of dead-end jobs, including trying to be a [[rodeo]] clown.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Weeks |first=Isaac |date=2015-06-15 |title=Songwriting legend Billy Joe Shaver is the real deal when it comes to outlaw country |url=http://charlestoncitypaper.com/2015/06/15/songwriting-legend-billy-joe-shaver-is-the-real-deal-when-it-comes-to-outlaw-country/ |access-date=2024-03-16 |website=Charleston City Paper |language=en-US}}</ref> About this time, he met and married Brenda Joyce Tindell. They had one son, [[Eddy Shaver|John Edwin, known as Eddy]], who was born in 1962. The two divorced and remarried several times.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Shaver took a job at a lumber mill to make ends meet. One day, his right (dominant) hand became caught in the machinery, and he lost the better part of two fingers and contracted a serious infection. He eventually recovered, and taught himself to play the guitar without the missing fingers.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Shaver set out to hitchhike to Los Angeles. He could not get a ride west, so he went to the other side of the highway and headed east, accompanying a man who dropped him off just outside [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The next ride brought him to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he found a job as a songwriter for $50 per week.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> His work came to the attention of [[Waylon Jennings]], who filled most of his album ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'' with Shaver's songs after meeting in a travel trailer at Willie Nelson's 4 July picnic. Other artists, including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]], began to record Shaver's music. This led to him getting his own record deal.

The first few recording companies he signed with soon folded.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He was never able to gain widespread recognition as a singer, although he never stopped recording his own music. On his records, he has been accompanied by other major rock and country musicians such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[Chuck Leavell]] and [[Dickey Betts]] (of the [[Allman Brothers]]), [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Flaco Jiménez]], and [[Al Kooper]].

After losing his wife, Brenda, and his mother to cancer in 1999, Shaver lost his son and longtime guitarist [[Eddy Shaver]], who died at age 38 on December 31, 2000. The listed cause of death was a heroin overdose, but there were suspicious circumstances surrounding the case as his face was bruised as if he had been punched multiple times, and the daughter of an Austin police officer was at the residence at the time. Folk country artist [[Todd Snider]] wrote and dedicated his song "Waco Moon" to Eddy. Shaver nearly died the following year when he had a heart attack on stage during an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] show at [[Gruene Hall]] in [[New Braunfels, Texas]]. After successful heart surgery, Shaver came back to release ''[[Freedom's Child]]'' in 2002.

In 1999, Shaver performed at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. In November 2005, he performed on the ''CMT Outlaws'' in 2005. In 2006, Shaver was inducted in the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]]. He later served as spiritual advisor to Texas independent gubernatorial candidate [[Kinky Friedman]]. For his efforts, the Americana Music Convention awarded him their Lifetime Achievement Award in Songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puremusic.com/shaver1.html |title=Billy Joe Shaver |website=Puremusic.com |access-date=February 24, 2013}}</ref> He lived in Waco, Texas.

[[Bob Dylan]] mentioned Shaver in his song "I Feel a Change Comin' On" (Bob Dylan and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]) on the album, ''[[Together Through Life]]'' (2009) – "I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver, And I'm reading James Joyce". Shaver is also the "hero" of the song, "Why Can't I Write Like Billy Joe" on the album ''Stormy Love'' by [[Bugs Henderson]].

Shaver's voice is heard on the themes to the [[Adult Swim]] television show ''[[Squidbillies]]''. The opening themes are only a stanza long and end with a ''[[sotto voce]]'' spoken-word portion. Season 1 Episode 5 of [[Mike Judge]]'s ''Tales From The Tour Bus'' features the life of Shaver.

=== Death ===
Shaver died on October 28, 2020, from a [[stroke]] at the age of 81.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Hudak |first1=Joseph |last2=Doyle |first2=Patrick |date=October 28, 2020 |title=Billy Joe Shaver, Seminal Outlaw Country Songwriter, Dead at 81 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/billy-joe-shaver-songwriter-dead-obituary-1082610/ |access-date=October 28, 2020 |website=Rollingstone.com}}</ref>

==Shooting in Lorena, Texas==
On April 2, 2007, police in [[Lorena, Texas]], issued two arrest warrants for Shaver on charges of aggravated assault and possessing a firearm in a prohibited place, in connection with an incident outside a tavern, Papa Joe's Texas Saloon, in Lorena two days prior, on March 31, in which Shaver shot a man, Billy Bryant Coker, in the face with a handgun. Coker's injuries, however, were not reported as life-threatening.

Witnesses interviewed by police report hearing Shaver say "Where do you want it?" and then, after the shot was fired, "Tell me you are sorry." and "No one tells me to shut up." Coker told police the attack was unprovoked. Shaver's attorney declared that Shaver had shot Coker "in self-defense" after Coker threatened Shaver with a knife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/pdf/04/040407shaver_affidavit.pdf |title=Affidavit |website=Alt.coxnewsweb.com |access-date=February 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309105627/http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/pdf/04/040407shaver_affidavit.pdf |archive-date=March 9, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In an August 2014 [[NPR]] interview, Shaver said that he shot Coker because he was "such a bully" and that "I hit him right between a mother and a fucker. That was the end of that. He dropped his weapons and said, 'I'm sorry.' And I said, 'Well, if you had said that inside, there would have been no problem.'"<ref name=autogenerated3 />

After unsuccessfully attempting to surrender to police in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]],  who were unaware of the warrant, Shaver turned himself in at McLennan County Jail in Waco on April 3. He was released after an hour on $50,000 bond and gave his scheduled performance at Waterloo Records in Austin that evening,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053195/arrest-warrant-issued-for-billy-joe-shaver|title=Arrest Warrant Issued For Billy Joe Shaver|date=April 3, 2007|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/stories/2007/04/4shaverbail.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429024444/http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/stories/2007/04/4shaverbail.html|date=April 29, 2007}}</ref> where he reportedly told fans, "Don't forget to pray for me, and tell your kids to pray for me, too."

He was acquitted in a Waco court on April 9, 2010, after testifying that he acted in self-defense, with friends Willie Nelson and Robert Duvall in attendance for support.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/04/09/arts/AP-US-People-Shaver-Shooting-Trial.html Country Singer Shaver Acquitted in Texas Shooting] New York Times (requires reg. to verify)</ref><ref>[http://www.countryweekly.com/billy_joe_shaver/news/4660 Country Weekly.com published April 14, 2010 by Bob Paxman] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423204545/http://www.countryweekly.com/billy_joe_shaver/news/4660 |date=April 23, 2010 }} Billy Joe Shaver Acquitted in Shooting</ref>

Texas-based country musician [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]] wrote a song about the incident titled "Where Do You Want It?". The song has been recorded by [[Whitey Morgan and the 78's]] and appears on their [[Whitey Morgan and the 78's (album)|self-titled second album]], released by [[Bloodshot Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/album/whitey-morgan-and-78s |title=Whitey Morgan and the 78's |publisher=Bloodshot Records |access-date=February 24, 2013}}</ref>

==Acting==
In 1996, Shaver took a part in the film ''[[The Apostle]]'' playing opposite [[Robert Duvall]]. He had additional speaking roles in the Duvall film ''[[Secondhand Lions]]'' (2003) and in ''[[The Wendell Baker Story]]'' (2005).

In 2004, a documentary of his life, ''A Portrait of Billy Joe'', was released. The documentary was directed by [[Luciana Pedraza]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Pedraza|first=Luciana|title=Portrait of Billy Joe|date=2004|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420084/|others=Billy Joe Shaver|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref> In 2006, a documentary of a concert, ''Billy Joe Shaver – North Carolina 2006'' was released on YouTube along with a limited number of DVDs.

Comedian [[Norm Macdonald]] was an avid Shaver fan and personal friend, opening his book ''Based on a True Story'' with a quote from one of his songs, and praising his songwriting on his podcast ''[[Norm Macdonald Live]]''. In 2018, Shaver appeared as a guest on Macdonald's [[Netflix]] program ''[[Norm Macdonald Has a Show]]''. In addition, Shaver's song ''I'm Just an Old Chunk of Coal'', was chosen as the closing music for Macdonald's posthumous Netflix comedy release of 2022 ''[[Norm Macdonald: Nothing Special]]''.
