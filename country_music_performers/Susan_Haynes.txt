By 2005, she began work on her album, which he and Mark Wright produced. Its lead-off single "Crooked Little Heart" failed to chart, but a cover of [[Maria McKee]]'s "Drinkin' in My Sunday Dress" peaked at No.&nbsp;51 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts in 2005. Following the latter single, Haynes' album was released only to digital retailers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3475 |last=Remz |first=Jeffrey B. |title=''Susan Haynes'' review |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |work=[[Country Standard Time]]}}</ref> "Not That Bad" was scheduled to be released as her third single.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=19 |last=Remz |first=Jeffrey B. |title=Susan Haynes marries |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |work=[[Country Standard Time]]}}</ref> After the Nashville division of Epic Records was closed in May 2006, Haynes exited the label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4479747-1.html |last=Stark |first=Phyllis |title=Sony BMG Folds Epic Nashville, Lays Off 20 Staffers |date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=January 26, 2009 |work=Radio Monitor}}</ref>
