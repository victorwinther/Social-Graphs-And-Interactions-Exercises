'''Thomas Rhett Akins Sr.''' (born October 13, 1969) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. Signed to [[Decca Records]] between 1994 and 1997, he released two albums for that label (1995's ''[[A Thousand Memories]]'' and 1996's ''[[Somebody New (album)|Somebody New]]''), followed by 1998's ''[[What Livin's All About]]'' on [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]]. ''[[Friday Night in Dixie]]'' was released in 2002 on [[Audium Entertainment]]. Overall, his albums have accounted for fourteen singles on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]], including the number one "[[Don't Get Me Started]]" from 1996.

Although he has not charted a single since 2006, Akins has written singles for other country music singers, primarily as one-third of the songwriting team [[The Peach Pickers]], alongside [[Dallas Davidson]] and [[Ben Hayslip]]. He is also the father of country singer [[Thomas Rhett]].

==Early life==
Thomas Rhett Akins Sr. was born on October 13, 1969, in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], to Pamela (née LaHood) and Thomas Akins.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p141711/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rhett Akins biography |access-date=2008-03-09 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> By age 11, he and his two younger brothers had formed a band.<ref name="encyclocountry">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLZz02EzmBYC&pg=PA166|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-992083-9|page=7}}</ref>  Rhett played football at the [[University of Georgia]] and studied business but gave up his studies after a year. He then worked for his father’s oil and gas distribution company.

==Career==
===1992–1994: Move to Nashville and recording contract===
In 1992,<ref name="encyclocountry"/> after performing in the theme park show "Music Country Music" at Fiesta Texas in San Antonio, Texas, Akins moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and performed in "Country Music USA" at Opryland Theme Park. Akins then became a demo singer before [[Decca Records]] signed him to a recording contract.<ref name="encyclocountry"/>

===1994–1997: ''A Thousand Memories'' and ''Somebody New''===
Akins's first single was "What They're Talkin' About", a No.&nbsp;35 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts in late 1994, followed by the No.&nbsp;36 "I Brake for Brunettes". After these first two singles came his signature song, "[[That Ain't My Truck]]". This was his breakthrough hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;3 on the country charts in mid-1995. All three of these songs were included on his 1995 debut album ''[[A Thousand Memories]]'', which also produced the No.&nbsp;17 "She Said Yes". Also in 1995 and 1996, Akins toured with [[Reba McEntire]].<ref name="allmusic"/> In 1995, he was named one of ''Country America's'' "Top New Stars".<ref name="encyclocountry"/>

Akins' second album, ''[[Somebody New (album)|Somebody New]]'', produced his only number one hit in "[[Don't Get Me Started]]", which peaked in August 1996. The other three singles from ''Somebody New'' were less successful, with "Love You Back" (the second single) becoming his last top 40 hit at No.&nbsp;38.

===1997–2004: Transfer to MCA Nashville, ''What Livin's All About'', and ''Friday Night in Dixie''===
After Decca's Nashville division was merged into [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] in 1997, Akins was transferred to MCA Nashville for the release of his third album, 1998's ''[[What Livin's All About]]''. This album was even less successful, however, with its lead-off single "More Than Everything" falling one space short of top 40 in the U.S., although it was a No.&nbsp;25 hit on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts in Canada. Also in 1998, Akins charted with a cover of [[Eddie Rabbitt]]'s 1980 number one hit "[[Drivin' My Life Away]]", which Akins covered on the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[Black Dog (1998 film)|Black Dog]]''.

In 2000, he voiced the character of Tom Sawyer in MGM's animated remake of ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' alongside fellow country singer [[Mark Wills]], who voiced Huckleberry Finn, as well as [[Lee Ann Womack]], who voiced Becky's singing voice. A fourth album, ''[[Friday Night in Dixie]]'', was released in 2002 on [[Koch Records]]. This album's only two singles, "Highway Sunrise" and "In Your Love", peaked at No.&nbsp;55 and No.&nbsp;57, respectively.

===2005–2006: BNA Records and ''People Like Me''===
Akins did not release another single until his signing with [[BNA Records]] in 2005, when he released the No.&nbsp;57-peaking "Kiss My Country Ass", which was later recorded by [[Blake Shelton]] for his 2010 extended play ''[[Hillbilly Bone]]''. It was included on his album ''People Like Me'', which was originally to have been released via BNA on June 14, 2006, but was ultimately self-released in June 2007. "[[If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away]]" was the second single from ''People Like Me'', which failed to chart for Akins, but was later recorded by [[Justin Moore]], whose version went to number 1. ''Down South'' followed in 2008, as did its only single, the title track, which again failed to chart.

===2009–2010: ''Michael Waddell's Bone Collector: The Brotherhood Album''===
In 2009, Akins released the single "Hung Up", which did not chart. It was later included on the 2010 album ''Michael Waddell's Bone Collector: The Brotherhood Album'', a collaboration with fellow [[country music]] singer [[Dallas Davidson]], released through [[Reprise Records]] Nashville.

===Songwriting career===
In the late 2000s, Akins began writing songs for other artists, primarily with [[Ben Hayslip]] and [[Dallas Davidson]], collaboratively known as [[The Peach Pickers]]. Among the singles that Akins has co-written are "[[Put a Girl in It]]" recorded by [[Brooks & Dunn]], "[[Barefoot and Crazy]]" by [[Jack Ingram]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.couleenews.com/articles/2009/08/14/features/01akins.txt|title=For Rhett Akins, life is good|last=Erickson|first=Randy|date=2009-08-14|work=Coulee News|access-date=2009-08-21}}</ref> "[[Gimmie That Girl]]" and "[[The Shape I'm In (Joe Nichols song)|The Shape I'm In]]" by [[Joe Nichols]], "[[All About Tonight (Blake Shelton song)|All About Tonight]]", "[[Honey Bee (Blake Shelton song)|Honey Bee]]", "[[I Lived It]]", and "[[Boys 'Round Here]]" by [[Blake Shelton]], "[[When She Says Baby]]", "[[Just Gettin' Started]]", "[[Tonight Looks Good on You]]" by [[Jason Aldean]], "[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]" by [[Josh Turner]], "Hot Mess" by [[Tyler Farr]], "[[Farmer's Daughter (Rodney Atkins song)|Farmer's Daughter]]" and "[[Take a Back Road (song)|Take a Back Road]]" by [[Rodney Atkins]], "[[Bait a Hook]]" and "[[Point at You]]" by [[Justin Moore]], "[[I Can Take It from There]]" by [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]], "[[I Know Somebody]]" by [[LoCash]], "[[Parking Lot Party]]", "[[That Don't Sound Like You]]" by [[Lee Brice]], "[[Hey Girl (Billy Currington song)|Hey Girl]]" by [[Billy Currington]], "[[I Don't Want This Night to End]]", "[[Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Every Day]]" by [[Luke Bryan]], "[[Wild in Your Smile]]", "[[Mind Reader (Dustin Lynch song)|Mind Reader]]", "[[Small Town Boy (song)|Small Town Boy]]" by [[Dustin Lynch]], "[[It Goes Like This (song)|It Goes Like This]]", "[[Get Me Some of That]]" and "[[Star of the Show]]" by [[Thomas Rhett]], "Granddaddy's Gun" by [[Aaron Lewis (musician)|Aaron Lewis]] and "[[A Buncha Girls]]", "[[Young & Crazy (Frankie Ballard song)|Young & Crazy]]" by [[Frankie Ballard]], "[[Kick It in the Sticks]]", "[[Small Town Throwdown]]" by [[Brantley Gilbert]]., "[[Ready Set Roll]]" by [[Chase Rice]], "[[Dirt on My Boots]]" by [[Jon Pardi]], “[[To Be Loved by You (Parker McCollum song)|To Be Loved By You]]” by [[Parker McCollum]] and "Missing" by [[William Michael Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/files/pdfs/country_update_1121.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.billboard.com |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202222613/http://www.billboard.com/files/pdfs/country_update_1121.pdf |archive-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
