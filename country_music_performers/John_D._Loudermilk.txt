His best-known songs include "[[Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)|Indian Reservation]]", a 1968 hit for UK singer [[Don Fardon]] and a  U.S. No. 1 hit in 1971 for [[Paul Revere & the Raiders|The Raiders]]. He wrote "[[Ebony Eyes (John D. Loudermilk song)|Ebony Eyes]]", a 1961 U.K. No. 1 and U.S. No. 8 for [[the Everly Brothers]]; "[[Tobacco Road (song)|Tobacco Road]]", a 1964 Top 20 hit in both the U.S. and the U.K. for [[the Nashville Teens]]; "This Little Bird", a U.K. No. 6 for [[Marianne Faithfull]] in 1965; and "[[Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye]]", a U.S. Top Ten hit in 1967 for [[the Casinos]] and No. 1 country hit for [[Eddy Arnold]] the following year.

==Early life and career==
Loudermilk was born in Durham, North Carolina, to Pauline and John D. Loudermilk Sr., an illiterate carpenter.<ref name=theguardian>{{cite news|last= Sweeting|first= Adam|title= John D Loudermilk obituary |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/27/john-d-loudermilk-obituary|access-date=November 22, 2016|newspaper =[[The Guardian]]|date=September 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=washingtonpost/> The family were members of the [[Salvation Army]]. He was influenced by the singing of the [[Christian Church]]. His cousins [[Ira Louvin|Ira]] and [[Charlie Louvin|Charlie Loudermilk]] were known professionally as [[the Louvin Brothers]].<ref name="Kingsbury2004">{{cite book|editor1=Paul Kingsbury|editor2=Laura Garrard|editor3=Daniel C. Cooper|editor4=John Rumble|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsiL49XFbnkC&pg=PT1241|date=16 December 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-984044-1|page=1241}}</ref> Loudermilk was a graduate of Campbell College (now [[Campbell University]]), a private North Carolina Baptist Convention-owned college in [[Buies Creek, North Carolina]].

As a young boy, Loudermilk learned the guitar, and while still in his teens wrote a poem that he set to music, "[[A Rose and a Baby Ruth]]". The owners of local television station [[WTVD]], where he worked as a graphic artist, allowed him to play the song on-air, resulting in [[country music|country]] musician [[George Hamilton IV]] putting it on record in 1956. It spent 20 weeks on the ''Billboard'' magazine pop chart, reaching No. 6.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=273}}</ref>

After [[Eddie Cochran]] had his first hit [[gramophone record|record]] with Loudermilk's "[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]", Loudermilk's career path was underway.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=john-d-loudermilk-mn0000217963 |tab=biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=John D. Loudermilk Biography |first=Richie |last=Unterberger |author-link=Richie Unterberger |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref>

Loudermilk recorded some of his own songs—including "Sittin' in the Balcony", which reached No. 38 on the pop charts in 1957—as "Johnny Dee", for the North Carolina-based [[Colonial Records]] label.

In 1958, he signed with [[Columbia Records]] and recorded five unsuccessful singles to 1959, including the original version of "Tobacco Road".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihesm.com/ |title=John D. Loudermilk Website |first=Kees |last=van der Hoeven |publisher=Ihesm.com |access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref> In 1961, he signed with [[RCA Victor]], where he had a number of hits:

* "Language of Love" (US No.&nbsp;32, UK Top 20) in 1961
* "[[Thou Shalt Not Steal (song)|Thou Shalt Not Steal]]" (US No.&nbsp;73) in 1962
* "Callin' [[Ben Casey|Doctor Casey]]" (US No.&nbsp;83) in 1962
* "Road Hog" (US No.&nbsp;65) in 1962

It was as a songwriter that Loudermilk made his mark. In 1963 he wrote another all-time hit for George Hamilton IV, "[[Abilene (song)|Abilene]]". Working out of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, Loudermilk became one of the most productive songwriters of the 1960s and 1970s, penning [[country music|country]] and pop music hits for [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Johnny Tillotson]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[the Nashville Teens]], [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]], [[Kris Jensen]], and [[Sue Thompson]]. His song "The Pale Faced Indian" (later known as "[[Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)|Indian Reservation]]") was a hit in the 1970s; and "[[Tobacco Road (song)|Tobacco Road]]" was a hit in the 1960s and 1970s for, among others, the Nashville Teens, [[Blues Magoos]], [[War (U.S. band)|Eric Burdon & War]], and [[David Lee Roth]]. Several singers recorded "Midnight Bus"; Loudermilk commented that the best was by [[Betty McQuade]] from [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.noise11.com/news/betty-mcquade-dies-at-70-20111229 |title=Betty McQuade Dies at 70 |first=Paul |last=Cashmere |author-link=Paul Cashmere |work=Noise11 |date=December 29, 2011}}</ref>

After suffering from prostate cancer and respiratory ailments, Loudermilk died on September 21, 2016, at his home in Christiana, Tennessee. He was 82. The actual cause of death was a heart attack, according to his son Michael.<ref name=washingtonpost>{{cite news|last=Schudel|first= Matt |title= John D.

== "Indian Reservation" ==
{{main|Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)}}
A well-known story surrounding one of Loudermilk's songs is that, when he was asked by the ''Viva! NashVegas'' radio show about the origins of the Raiders' hit song "[[Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)|Indian Reservation]]", he fabricated the story that he wrote the song after his car was snowed in by a blizzard and he was taken in by [[Cherokee]] Indians.<ref name=TallTale>{{YouTube|id=LNeou8cx8_o |title="The Story Behind 'Indian Reservation'" on Viva! NashVegas}}</ref> A self-professed [[prank]]ster,<ref name=theguardian/> he spun the tale that a Cherokee chieftain, "Bloody Bear Tooth" asked him to make a song about his people's plight and the [[Trail of Tears]], even going so far as to claim that he had later been awarded "the first medal of the [[Cherokee Nation]]", not for writing the song, but for his "blood"; further fabricating that his "great-great grandparents, Homer and Matilda Loudermilk" were listed on the [[Dawes Rolls]].<ref name=TallTale/> Had this tall tale been true, he would have been a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, which he was not.<ref name=TallTale/>

In spite of the song's title, neither the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], nor the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]], nor the [[Cherokee Nation]] of Oklahoma communities (the only [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally-recognized]] Cherokee tribes) are known as "reservations".
