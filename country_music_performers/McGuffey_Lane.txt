'''McGuffey Lane''' is an American [[country rock]] band from [[Athens, Ohio]], and/or [[Columbus, Ohio]], United States. The group was formed in 1972 by Terry Efaw and Steve Reis, who played together under the name Scotch & Soda. After adding songwriter, lead singer, and guitarist Bobby E. McNelley, they branded themselves McGuffey Lane, the location of Reis's [[Athens, Ohio]], home.

The band eventually expanded to a sextet and became well-known locally, releasing their first album on their own Paradise Island record label. The [[LP record|LP]] sold more than 40,000 copies,<ref name=amg>{{cite web|author=Sandra Brennan |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mcguffey-lane-mn0000397192/biography |title=McGuffey Lane &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> and eventually resulted in their signing with [[Atco Records]]. They reissued the debut in 1980 and toured with the [[Charlie Daniels Band]], [[The Judds]], and the [[Allman Brothers Band]]. The follow-up, ''Aqua Dream'', featured the single "Start It All Over", which spent three weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 97 in February 1982.<ref name="Hot 100 chart history">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/mcguffey-lane |title=McGuffey Lane &#124; Billboard |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2019-02-22 |archive-date=2019-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223094337/https://www.billboard.com/music/mcguffey-lane |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The group scored several minor hits on the country charts, but their label wanted to market them more as a pop-country act in the vein of [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]. They moved to [[Atlantic Records]] to focus more on country chart success, but as they prepared 1984's ''Day By Day'', keyboardist Tebes Douglass was killed in a [[car crash]]. Soon after, Bobby Gene McNelley left the group to pursue a solo career as a songwriter in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In 1985, McGuffey Lane was dropped from Atlantic. In 1986, they released a [[Christmas]] album in support of the Central Ohio Lung Association; toward the end of that year, they inked a sponsorship with [[Miller Beer]], but a planned comeback fizzled.

The group played into the late 1980s but had dissolved by 1990. In 1995, they reunited after releasing a greatest hits album, and continued performing locally in Ohio into the 2000s. Two full-length releases followed the reunion, in 1998 and 2002. On August 18, 2009,  they opened for [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] at [[Lifestyle Communities Pavilion|The LC]] in Columbus, Ohio. In March 2010, Lick Records signed a distribution deal with E1 Entertainment, which allows the new McGuffey Lane album to be sold in [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Best Buy]].

==Zachariah's Red Eye Reunion==
Every January, McGuffey Lane holds an annual reunion concert featuring many acts who also played at Zachariah's Red Eye Saloon. The first two reunions were held at Villa Milano Banquet and Conference Center, located on Schrock Road on the northeast side of Columbus, Ohio. After the initial two events, John Schwab (who is the organizer of the event) started looking for a larger venue to host the reunion concert, as it had outgrown Villa Milano. He settled on Lifestyles Communities Pavilion (now [[KEMBA Live!]]). The 2013 Reunion currently holds the indoor attendance record at the LC. The fourteenth anniversary took place on January 25, 2014.

Some acts who have taken part in the event are: Rob McNelly (son of original lead singer Bobby Gene McNelly and current guitarist for [[Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band]]), John David Call (steel guitarist for [[Pure Prairie League]]), Steve Smith, Gary Ballen, Delyn Christian, Tom Ingham, the Dan Orr Project, Cliff Cody, Grassanine, and [[Erica Blinn]].
