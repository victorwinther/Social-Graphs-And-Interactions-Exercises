== Career ==
[[File:Lauderdale-fls.jpg|thumb|left|Jim Lauderdale at MerleFest in 2007.]]

After graduating from college, Lauderdale lived in Nashville for five months in the summer of 1979 while he tried to get a recording or publishing deal. He hung out a lot with [[Roland White]], an accomplished mandolin player, with whom he cut a record. But things never took off, so he decided to move to New York,<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013>{{cite web|last=Dye|first=David|title=Buddy Miller And Jim Lauderdale On World Cafe |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/11/176161225/buddy-miller-and-jim-lauderdale-on-world-cafe|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=January 3, 2014|format=audio interview|date=April 11, 2013}}</ref> where he played in [[Floyd Domino]]'s band and performed as a solo artist. In 1980 he met singer-songwriter [[Buddy Miller]].<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 /> He played in Miller's band in the active twang music scene that was evolving at the time.<ref name=DO-1999 />

During his time in New York City, he also worked in the mailroom and as a messenger at ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref name=NPR-Buddy&JimTDC /> He often was assigned to pick up and drop off photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]]'s equipment.<ref name=DO-1999 />

Lauderdale joined the national touring production of ''[[Pump Boys & Dinettes]]'', which eventually reached Los Angeles where he met musicians [[Rosie Flores]], Billy Bremmer, [[Pete Anderson]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], and others.<ref name=DO-1999 /> John Ciambotti became Lauderdale's manager and Lauderdale relocated to Los Angeles in the late 1980s, recording an album for CBS (which was later released as ''The Point of No Return''). The record was influenced by the [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] sound of [[Buck Owens]].<ref name=DO-1999 />

Armed with a catalog of a few hundred songs he had written, Lauderdale was able to get a publishing deal with a small company called Blue Water Music (based in Houston, with a small office in Nashville). Living in Los Angeles he made a record with Anderson producing, but it was never released.<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 />

Lauderdale then got a publishing deal with Reprise and moved into the second floor of Buddy and Julie Miller's house until he got his own place in Nashville.<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 />

In 2013, Lauderdale started his own record label, Sky Crunch, so that he could release his many albums on a schedule that suited him.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode275 Americana Music Show #275], published December 1, 2015</ref>

In April 2018, Lauderdale signed to Yep Roc Records.<ref name=Yep-Roc-Records>{{cite web|title=Yep Roc Records Welcomes Jim Lauderdale!|url=http://www.yeproc.com/yep-roc-records-welcomes-jim-lauderdale|access-date=May 23, 2018|date=April 24, 2018}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===

Lauderdale's solo debut, ''Planet of Love'', was produced by [[Rodney Crowell]] and [[John Leventhal]] and released in 1991.<ref name=DO-1999 /><ref name=MusicMonitor-TurnLeft>{{cite web |last=Winkworth |first=Bruce |title=Go to the Country, Turn Left |url=http://www.penduluminc.com/MM/articles/lauderdale.html |work=The Music Monitor|access-date=December 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106152010/http://www.penduluminc.com/MM/articles/lauderdale.html|archive-date=November 6, 2006}}</ref> ''Lost in the Lonesome Pines'', a 2002 collaboration with [[Ralph Stanley]], won the [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]].

In 2007, he began a collaboration with [[Larry Campbell]], the band Olabelle, and others in the ''American Beauty Project,'' a loose collection of musicians dedicated to reimagining in performance the [[Grateful Dead]]'s two classic 1970 albums, ''[[Workingman's Dead]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]''.

In 2011, Lauderdale toured with [[Hot Tuna]], an ensemble act that included [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Jack Casady]], Barry Mitterhof, [[G.E. Smith]], and, for a time, [[Charlie Musselwhite]]. He has also toured with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rhonda Vincent]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and others.

==== Dr. Ralph Stanley ====
Lauderdale wrote and produced two bluegrass records with [[Ralph Stanley]]. Their first collaboration, ''I Feel Like Singing Today'', was nominated for a Grammy.

==== Buddy Miller ====

Lauderdale released a record called ''Buddy and Jim'' with long-time friend and collaborator [[Buddy Miller]] in 2013.<ref name=NPR-Buddy&JimTDC>{{cite web|title=Buddy Miller & Jim Lauderdale: Tiny Desk Concert|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/183595144/buddy-miller-jim-lauderdale-tiny-desk-concert|work=Tiny Desk Concert|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|format=video performance and interview|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref> Lauderdale said they recorded it in three days in Miller's home studio. Miller did the mixing and producing.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Robert Hunter ====
Lauderdale has often collaborated with [[Grateful Dead]] lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]].<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

Lauderdale's first collaboration with Hunter was ''Headed for the Hills'' and the second was ''Patchwork River'' in May 2010. The June 2011 release ''Reason and Rhyme'' was their third collaboration. Additionally, they wrote songs for a [[North Mississippi Allstars]] record that was released in the fall of 2013.<ref name=TwangNation2013 />

Two 2013 releases, ''Black Roses'' and ''Blue Moon Junction,'' were co-written with Hunter. ''Black Roses'' features North Mississippi Allstars' Cody and [[Luther Dickinson]], whom Lauderdale met in Nashville at the Americana Music Festival,<ref name=CMTEdge-2014>{{cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Brian T.|title=Jim Lauderdale Teams Up for New Albums, Grammy Nod|url=http://www.cmtedge.com/2014/01/09/jim-lauderdale-teams-up-for-new-albums-grammy-nod/|work=CMT Edge|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] / [[Country Music Television|Country Music Television, Inc.]]|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref> as well as [[Muscle Shoals]] musicians [[Spooner Oldham]] and [[David Hood]]. The album was recorded at their father [[Jim Dickinson]]'s studio, Zebra Ranch in Mississippi.<ref name=CMTEdge-2014 />

2013's ''Blue Moon Junction'' features Lauderdale's work as a singer and songwriter, some of them co-written with Hunter in a solo, acoustic format. Lauderdale produced the record.<ref name=CMTEdge-2014 /> Lauderdale says that they have more material that might make a good follow-up album, and hopes they will have time to collaborate again soon.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Nick Lowe ====
Lauderdale performed solo as the opening act for [[Nick Lowe]] on the latter's 1995 tour of the U.S. and Europe with the Impossible Birds. He later recorded with longtime members of Lowe's band and other British musicians at London's Goldtop Studio, sessions resulting in the 2017 album ''London Southern''.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Roland White ====

On August 3, 2018, Lauderdale released ''Jim Lauderdale and Roland White,'' a previously lost record made with mandolin master [[Roland White]]. The disc was recorded in Earl Scruggs' basement in 1979, and the songs were only found recently by White's wife.<ref name=RollingStone-2018/>

=== The Jim Lauderdale Phenomenon ===
The term "the Jim Lauderdale Phenomenon", coined by singer-songwriter [[Kim Richey]] and cited in an April 2000 article in ''[[The Tennessean]]'' by writer Peter Cooper, is an ironic reference to the fact that Lauderdale was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for his work with Stanley but was released from a record deal with [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA]] not long after. He was also released from contracts with Warner Bros., Columbia, and Atlantic Records.<ref name=Tennessean-RCA-drop>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Peter|title=Without 'star-level' clout, Lauderdale released from RCA|url=http://www.insurgentcountry.com/jim_lauderdale_dropped_from_rca.txt|work=[[The Tennessean]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221172233/http://www.insurgentcountry.com/jim_lauderdale_dropped_from_rca.txt|archive-date=February 21, 2001}}</ref><ref name=CL-Whisper-review>{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=James|title=Music: Jim Lauderdale, Whisper|url=http://web.cln.com/archives/atlanta/newsstand/030798/v_rec7.htm|work=[[Creative Loafing]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010222041342/http://web.cln.com/archives/atlanta/newsstand/030798/v_rec7.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2001}}</ref> The article notes that many country artists that were signed to major labels in the 1990s failed to get radio airtime and had their contracts dropped after making one or two albums.<ref name=Tennessean-RCA-drop/> The problem became widespread in Nashville during this period, when a lot of good music was being created and recorded, but the megastars dominated the airwaves.<ref name=DO-PenPal-1998>{{cite news|last=Rowland|first=Hobart|title=Pen pal: Jim Lauderdale is the write man in the wrong place|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1998-05-21/music/pen-pal/|access-date=December 14, 2013|newspaper=Dallas Observer|date=May 21, 1998}}</ref>
