== Notes ==
{{noteslist|refs=

{{efn|name="dob.uncertainty"|''[[The Santa Clarita Valley Signal]]'' reports that Edward's age when he died on October 23, 2022 as 86,<ref name="signal.edwards.2022.10.24"/> which would put his birth year as 1935 or 1936. However, AllMusic reports Edward's date of birth as March 20, 1939.<ref name="allmusic.bio"/> The use of AllMusic for biographical details is not fully supported by Wikipedia editors (see [[WP:RSP]]), so it is not being used in this article to verify his date of birth unless subsequent reports clarify his birth date. AllMusic is, however, being used to verify his place of birth.}}
