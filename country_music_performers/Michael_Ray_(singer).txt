'''Michael Ray Roach''' (born April 29, 1988) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. He is signed to [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He has released two albums for the label: ''[[Michael Ray (album)|Michael Ray]]'' and ''[[Amos (album)|Amos]]''.

==Biography==
Ray was born in [[Eustis, Florida]]. He was inspired by his grandfather Amos "Wilson" Roach, who played music for him and taught him how to play guitar, in addition to having him perform at assisted living centers. Ray chose to form a band in southern Florida after graduating high school, and a disc jockey at [[WPCV]] began playing his music. He released an album independently in 2010, which was discovered by manager Tony Conway.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Ray was mentored by [[John Rich]] of [[Big & Rich]] on the singing competition ''[[The Next: Fame Is at Your Doorstep]]'', which he won. He and Rich co-wrote Big & Rich's 2015 single, "[[Run Away with You]]".<ref name=People-5Things-2015>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Danielle|title=5 Things to Know About 'Kiss You in the Morning Singer' Michael Ray|url=http://www.people.com/article/michael-ray-5-things-to-know|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=September 13, 2015|access-date=September 13, 2015}}</ref> After winning the competition, Ray was signed to [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]] Nashville. His first EP, ''Tour Bootleg'', was released in 2014. Two of the EP's tracks, "[[Kiss You in the Morning]]" (which went to number one on the [[Country Airplay]] charts in 2015) and "[[Think a Little Less]]," appeared later on his [[Michael Ray (album)|self-titled second album]], released in 2015, becoming his first and third singles, respectively. The track "[[Real Men Love Jesus]]" was named as Ray's second single. Ray supported the album with a tour.<ref name="allmusic"/>

On June 16, 2017, Ray released the single "[[Get to You (Michael Ray song)|Get to You]]" ahead of his third studio album, ''[[Amos (album)|Amos]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMc1uiutcWA|title=Michael Ray - "Get To You" (Chapter 1)|date=June 16, 2017 |access-date=January 27, 2022|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> After the album's release in 2018, it produced two more singles: "[[One That Got Away]]" and "Her World or Mine."
