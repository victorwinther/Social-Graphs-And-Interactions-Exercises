'''Ferlin Eugene Husky''' (December 3, 1925 – March 17, 2011)<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/arts/music/ferlin-husky-country-singer-dies-at-85.html "Velvet-Voiced Ferlin Husky Dies at 85"] ''New York Times''. Retrieved 2014-7-16.</ref> was an American [[country music]] singer who was equally adept at honky-tonk, ballads, spoken recitations, [[rockabilly]] and pop tunes.

From 1948 to 1953, he recorded under the [[stage name]] Terry Preston.<ref name="McArdle 2011"/> He also created and recorded as the comic, outspoken hayseed character, Simon Crum. In the 1950s and '60s, his hits included "[[Gone (Ferlin Husky song)|Gone]]" and "[[Wings of a Dove (Bob Ferguson song)|Wings of a Dove]]", each reaching number one on the country charts. Between 1953 and 1975, he had 11 top 10 hits, two dozen top 20 hits and a total of 50 songs in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine's top 100 country songs. His versatility and matinee-idol looks propelled a seven-decade entertainment career.<ref name="McArdle 2011">McArdle, Terence "County music showman had comic alter ego" (March 18, 2011) ''The Washington Post'', p. B7</ref> In 2010, he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==
Ferlin Husky was born in [[Gumbo, Missouri]], an unincorporated community in northwestern [[St. Francois County, Missouri]].<ref>[http://www.ferlinhusky.com/Ferlin_Husky_Biography.html "Ferlin Husky Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217015934/http://ferlinhusky.com/Ferlin_Husky_Biography.html |date=2016-02-17 }}, FerlinHusky.com; retrieved July 16, 2014.</ref> His mother named him Furland, but his name was misspelled on his birth certificate. Husky grew up on a farm near [[Flat River, Missouri|Flat River]] and attended school in [[Irondale, Missouri|Irondale]]. An uncle taught him to play the guitar. After dropping out of high school, he moved to [[St. Louis]], where he worked as a truck driver and steel mill worker while performing in [[honky tonk]]s at night.<ref name="McArdle 2011"/>

During World War II, Husky served in the [[United States Merchant Marine]] for five years, entertaining troops on transport ships. His website states that his ship participated in the [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] invasion of [[Cherbourg]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His Simon Crum character evolved from stories he told during those years about a Missouri neighbor named Simon Crump.<ref name="McArdle 2011"/>

After the war, Husky continued to develop his Simon Crum character while working as a [[disc jockey]] in Missouri and then in [[Bakersfield, California]], into the late 1940s.<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Fifties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-732-0|page=177}}</ref> He began using the stage name Terry Preston at the suggestion of [[Smiley Burnette]] who claimed Ferlin Husky would never work on a marquee.<ref name="McArdle 2011"/> He signed with [[Capitol Records]] in 1953 as a honky-tonk singer under the guidance of [[Cliffie Stone]], who also managed [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]].<ref name="Larkin50"/> When at Capitol, he returned to using his given name although for his first few singles his last named was listed as "Huskey".<ref name="Larkin50"/> A few singles failed before "[[A Dear John Letter]]" with [[Jean Shepard]] became a number one hit that year topping Billboard magazine's country charts and reaching number four on its pop charts.<ref name="Larkin50"/> They followed it up that year with "Forgive Me John" which reached number four on Billboard's Most Played Country and Western Juke Boxes chart and number 24 on its Hot 100 chart turning the unknown singers into star performers in the United States.<ref name="Larkin50"/> In 1955, Husky had a solo hit with "I Feel Better All Over (More Than Anywheres Else)" / "Little Tom". As Simon Crum, he signed a separate contract with Capitol Records and began releasing records, the biggest of which was 1959's "Country Music is Here to Stay" reaching number two for three weeks.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In the late 1950s, Husky had a long string of hits, including the number one "Gone" which stayed at the top of the charts for ten weeks in 1957 and was on the charts for a total of 27 weeks. (Husky had previously recorded the song in 1952 as Terry Preston, but the earlier version lacked the newly emerging [[Nashville sound]] production of [[Bradley Studios]],<ref name="CMWW">{{cite magazine|last=Snoddy|first=Glen|title=Nashville, The Recording Center|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Record-World/70s/72/Record-World-Country-Music-Who%27s-Who-1972_428.pdf|magazine=Country Music Who's Who|publisher=Record World|date=1972|access-date=10 May 2024}}</ref> which included [[String section|strings]] and backup singers).<ref name="Larkin50"/> "Gone" was a [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] success, also reaching number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop music chart]]. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London, UK|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/92 92]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/92}}</ref> The song's popularity led to a stint as a summer replacement host in 1957 on CBS-TV's ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''.<ref name="McArdle 2011"/>

He began acting, appearing on the ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'', and played himself in the 1957 film ''[[Mister Rock and Roll (film)|Mister Rock and Roll]]''<ref name="Larkin50"/> (his website states he had bit parts in 18 films, including with [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] and [[Mamie Van Doren]]). He received sole top billing in a 1971 low budget, [[Backcountry|back country]] film with the film's opening credits stating, "Ferlin Husky in ''[[Swamp Girl]]''".

in 1960, Bob Ferguson's "Wings of a Dove" became his biggest hit, topping the country charts for 10 weeks and reaching number 12 on the pop chart.<ref name="Larkin50"/> Husky was also known for his ability to imitate other popular country singers, including Tennessee Ernie Ford and [[Kitty Wells]].<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Although he did not have more chart-toppers, he charted three dozen hits between 1961 and 1972, with the biggest being "Once" (1967) and "Just for You" (1968). In late 1972, after over 20 years with Capitol, Husky signed with [[ABC Records]], where he scored several top 40 hits into 1975,<ref name="Larkin50"/> with the biggest being the top 20 "Rosie Cries a Lot" (1973). Husky briefly retired in 1977 following heart surgery, then resumed touring.<ref name="Larkin50"/> He remained a popular concert draw, performing at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and elsewhere. He was married four times and for the last six years of his life lived with his long-time love, [[Leona Williams]] (former wife of [[Merle Haggard]]).

Husky suffered from [[cardiopathy]] for many years and was hospitalized several times beginning in the late 1970s, including for heart surgery in 2005 and for blood clots in his legs in 2007. He was admitted to St. John's Hospital in [[Springfield, Missouri]], on April 19, 2009, with [[congestive heart failure]] and [[pneumonia]]. On July 15, 2009, his spokesman said he was recuperating at home after being released from a Nashville hospital.

On February 23, 2010, the [[Country Music Association]] announced his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was heralded for his vocal and comic prowess—and "all around showmanship"—that left a legacy as "one of the best entertainers country music has ever produced".

On January 16, 2011, he was honored at West St. Francois County High School in [[Leadwood, Missouri]], where local singers and the high-school choir sang some of his hits. Husky also donated several items of memorabilia, including his Country Music Hall of Fame award, to the city of Leadwood which are permanently stored at the high school.

On March 8, 2011, Husky was hospitalized again after several days after not feeling well. By the weekend, he had improved and moved out of the [[coronary care unit]]. On March 17, he died of congestive heart failure at his daughter's home in [[Westmoreland, Tennessee]].<ref>Cooper, Peter "Ferlin Husky dies in Tennessee at 85" (March 17, 2011) ''The Tennessean''</ref>

He was buried next to his son, Danny Louis Husky, in [[Hendersonville Memory Gardens]] in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]].
