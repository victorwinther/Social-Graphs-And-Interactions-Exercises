'''Whiskeytown''' was an American [[alternative country]] band formed in 1994 from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. Fronted by [[Ryan Adams]], the group included members [[Caitlin Cary]], [[Phil Wandscher]], Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, and [[Mike Daly]]. They disbanded in 2000 with Adams leaving to pursue his solo career. Whiskeytown gradually expanded its sound outside the confines of alternative country while still maintaining its alternative roots.

The band released three albums. No two albums shared a consistent lineup; Adams and Cary remained the only constants.

== History ==
After performing punk rock with a band called The Patty Duke Syndrome, Adams founded Whiskeytown in 1994 in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. The music of country-rock artist [[Gram Parsons]] served as his inspiration. The band initially consisted of Adams, violinist [[Caitlin Cary]], drummer Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, bassist Steve Grothmann and guitarist [[Phil Wandscher]].<ref name=Guardian2001>{{cite news |title='I'm not a star to myself.

=== ''Faithless Street'' era (1995–1996) ===
''[[Faithless Street]]'', released on Mood Food Records in 1995, established the band as one of the genre's leaders, thanks to glowing reviews in publications such as ''[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]'', and helped the band score a major-label record deal with the [[Geffen Records]] imprint Outpost.

''Faithless'' was re-released on the imprint in 1998 with nearly a dozen bonus tracks from the era. Among the bonus tracks were previously unreleased tracks and tracks that had been released on earlier albums and EPs, including ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'' and ''[[Rural Free Delivery (EP)|Rural Free Delivery]]''. One track, "Oklahoma," was removed. Adams claimed that the reason for the re-release was the muddy sound of the original version and his distaste for "Oklahoma," which was added to the album despite his objections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435210/09011998/whiskeytown.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040521063536/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435210/09011998/whiskeytown.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 21, 2004 |title=News – Articles – 1435210 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=September 1, 1998 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

=== ''Strangers Almanac'' era (1997–1998) ===
Whiskeytown's 1997 major-label debut, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', helped to establish Adams' reputation as a songwriter. In the midst of the album's recording, Gilmore and Grothman left, and Wandscher left soon after the album's release. The band cycled through numerous members throughout the next year, including [[Jeff Rice]] and Steven Terry, both of whom were involved in the recording of ''Almanac'' but left later that year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The band's reputation preceded it in the live setting. In a 1997 ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' article titled Whiskeytown: half band, half soap opera, a June 1997 show at Mac's Bar in [[Lansing, Michigan]] was described by fans as a half-baked performance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McCollum |first=Brian |date=October 24, 1997 |title=Whiskeytown: half band, half soap opera |url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/1997%20Shows/1997.10.25.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203081214/http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/1997%20Shows/1997.10.25.htm |archive-date=February 3, 2011 |access-date=November 14, 2023 |website=answeringbell.com}}</ref>

Despite the band's internal strife, ''Almanac'' was a successful album with critics, with the tracks "16 Days" and the Replacements-esque "Yesterday's News" receiving significant radio play. The positive reviews came from increasingly mainstream publications such as ''Rolling Stone'', who claimed at the time, ''"If there's to be a [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] among the bands that are imprecisely dubbed alternative country, look to Whiskeytown."''<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whiskeytown/albums/album/100139/review/5940837/strangers_almanac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118110424/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whiskeytown/albums/album/100139/review/5940837/strangers_almanac|date=November 18, 2007}}</ref>  In January 1998, the band taped a live performance for ''[[Austin City Limits]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/1998%20Shows/1998.01.26.htm |title=01/26/98 |publisher=Answeringbell.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

During the tour for ''[[Stranger's Almanac]]'', most of the band was fired or quit at a concert in Kansas City. The only people who started and finished the tour were Adams, [[Caitlin Cary]], [[Mike Daly]] and tour manager [[Thomas O'Keefe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2001/12/01/ryan-adams-saving-private-ryan/ |title=Ryan Adams: Saving Private Ryan |publisher=Magnetmagazine.com |date=December 1, 2001 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

=== ''Pneumonia'' and the band's demise (1999–2001) ===
The band managed to add a new core member in multi-instrumentalist [[Mike Daly]], who contributed significantly to the band's sound on their third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]]''.

The album's recording was a much different affair from the first two—likely because of the band's constantly changing dynamic. The traditional country of the first two albums, especially ''Faithless'', was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop sound, very similar to [[Wilco]]'s 1999 album ''[[Summerteeth]]''. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]]' [[Tommy Stinson]] and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' [[James Iha]].

Despite the album's completion and Whiskeytown's sizable fanbase, Outpost Records closed during the merger between Polygram and Universal, and as a result the album stayed in limbo for nearly two years, effectively ending the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2000-12-21/music/swan-song/2|title=Swan Song – Page 2 – Music – Phoenix – Phoenix New Times|first=Bill|last= Holdship|date=December 21, 2000|access-date=January 3, 2011|publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]]}}</ref>

[[Lost Highway Records]], the roots-minded label imprint of [[Universal Music]], picked up the album after signing Adams (who, in the interim, recorded his highly acclaimed debut solo record ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' on indie label [[Bloodshot Records]]) and released it in May 2001 [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r532907|pure_url=yes}}].

=== Post-Whiskeytown and talk of reunion ===
Since the band dissolved, most core members have chosen to remain active in music. Cary, who married original drummer Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, has released three solo albums and created a female folk trio named [[Tres Chicas]].<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5935412/cary_strikes_up_tres_chicas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002100552/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5935412/cary_strikes_up_tres_chicas|date=October 2, 2007}}</ref> In 2010 she formed a duo group called The Small Ponds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmallponds.com/home.cfm |title=Home |publisher=The Small Ponds |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> with Matt Douglas of Raleigh band The Proclivities. In 2013, Cary and solo artist [[Jon Lindsay (musician)|Jon Lindsay]] co-founded the [http://www.ncmusiclovearmy.org/ NC Music Love Army] – a collective of many notable musicians from North Carolina who oppose the leadership of the newly emerged Republican supermajority in their home state. Between 2013 and 2014, the group has put out nine releases on their own label (Love Army Records), as well as thru [[Redeye Distribution]] and [[Bloodshot Records]].

Adams has remained in the spotlight since the band's breakup, releasing numerous solo albums, including three in 2005. In 2004, Adams founded [[Ryan Adams and The Cardinals]], an alternative rock band. The band released several albums before disbanding in 2009.<ref name=RollStone2008>{{cite magazine |title=Ryan Adams and the Cardinals |date=October 28, 2008 |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/23181054/page/29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922234353/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/23181054/page/29 |archive-date=September 22, 2008 }}</ref> He has drawn considerable praise from such legends as [[Elton John]] and [[Phil Lesh]] for his songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449631/20011004/john_elton.jhtml?headlines=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005182343/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449631/20011004/john_elton.jhtml?headlines=true |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 5, 2001 |title=Elton John Bags Technology; Praises Eminem, Ryan Adams – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=October 5, 2001 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>  In February 2001, original Whiskeytown guitarist [[Phil Wandscher]] joined Adams at a Seattle show to perform two songs.  It was the first time the two had appeared onstage together in 3½ years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/2001%20Shows/2001.02.13.htm |title=02/13/01 |publisher=Answeringbell.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

Adams and Cary have claimed to be reuniting Whiskeytown on multiple occasions, as recently as 2010, but nothing new has been released yet. He told an interviewer in January 2017 that he was writing a book about the band, but had no plans to record or tour with Whiskeytown.<ref name=JamBase17>{{cite news |title=Ryan Adams Writing Book About Whiskeytown |date=January 25, 2017 |first=Andy |last=Kahn |work=JamBase |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/ryan-adams-writing-book-whiskeytown }}</ref> A scheduling conflict was blamed as the reason for the reunion not taking place. The band did reunite for a one-off, impromptu gig after one of Adams' shows in Raleigh, NC, in 2005. Gilmore, Cary, and Adams were joined on-stage by Adams' pedal steel player, Jon Graboff, and bassist [[Catherine Popper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/2005%20Shows/2005.06.08.htm |title=06/08/05 |publisher=Answeringbell.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>
