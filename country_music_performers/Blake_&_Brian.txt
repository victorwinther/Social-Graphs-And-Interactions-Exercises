'''Blake & Brian''' was an American [[country music]] duo composed of singer-songwriters Brian Gowan (born January 7, 1969, in [[Temple, Texas]]) and Blake Weldon (September 13, 1966, in [[Lufkin, Texas]]).<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=244|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}<!--|accessdate=6 October 2009--></ref>

The two were paired up by record producer Chuck Howard in 1995.<ref name="cst">{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=205 |title=Blake & Brian - ''Blake & Brian'' |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last=Allread |first=Walter |work=[[Country Standard Time]]}}</ref><ref name="baby"/> Their self-titled debut album was issued in 1997 on the [[Curb Records]] label. The album's lead-off single, "Another Perfect Day", peaked at No.&nbsp;45 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a mixed review, stating that although Gowan and Weldon were "indistinguishable vocally and equally malleable", and although some of the songs were derivative of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], the more up-tempo tracks were "punch[ed] up... with timeless [[Texas]] kick".<ref name="cst"/> After releasing this album, they charted two more singles ("The Wish" and "Amnesia"), the latter of which was not included on an album. By 1999, Blake & Brian had parted ways. Gowan released a solo album entitled ''Warm Spanish Wine'' in 2000.<ref name="baby">{{cite web |url=http://cdbaby.com/cd/gowan2 |title=Warm Spanish Wine |accessdate=2008-07-13 |work=CDBaby.com}}</ref> He also co-wrote [[Rodney Atkins]]' 1997 debut single "In a Heartbeat" and three songs on Atkins' 2003 debut album ''[[Honesty (Rodney Atkins album)|Honesty]]''.
