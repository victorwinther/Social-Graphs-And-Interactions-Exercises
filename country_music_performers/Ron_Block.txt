==Biography==
Ron Block heard a variety of music at an early age because his father owned a music store, Hogan's House of Music, in southern California. At home he was drawn to the bluegrass music of [[Bill Monroe]], [[J. D. Crowe]], and [[The Stanley Brothers]]. At the age of 13, after seeing [[Earl Scruggs]] on TV, he learned to play the banjo. In his teens he also learned acoustic and electric guitar. Later in his career, he recorded a solo album of instrumentals, titled ''Hogan's House of Music'' (2015), dedicated to the music store where he spent much of his youth.<ref name="Hogan's">{{cite web|last1=Lawless|first1=John|title=Hogan's House Of Music – Ron Block|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/hogans-house-of-music-ron-block/|website=Bluegrass Today|date=14 October 2015|access-date=2 June 2016}}</ref>
