== Life and career ==
Wetzel was born in [[Pittsburg, Texas]], with one of his names being a reference to outlaw country singer-songwriter [[David Allan Coe]].<ref name=":0" /> His mother was a touring country singer, bringing the young Koe along and his father worked in construction. He would perform on stage for the first time at age six.<ref name=":4" /> Later, Wetzel was a [[linebacker]] at [[Tarleton State University]] in [[Stephenville, Texas]], where he decided to pursue a career as a musician instead.<ref name=":0" />

Wetzel formed "Koe Wetzel and Konvicts", and self-released an EP and one full-length album. His "rowdy" music and lyrics became popular among college students and young adults, and ''Noise Complaint,'' released in 2016, was considered to be his breakout album.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Koe Wetzel: Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/koe-wetzel-mn0003724456/biography|access-date=2021-07-02|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref> Beginning with ''Noise Complaint'', the full name of the band was dropped, though Wetzel still performs with a bassist, one drummer, and two guitarists.<ref>{{Cite web|title=KOE WETZEL|url=https://www.chilifest.org/koe-wetzel/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=Chilifest 2020 Official Website|language=en-US}}</ref> The band signed with Red 11 Music in Austin, TX in early 2018 while being managed by 4-Tay Management out of Stephenville, TX until 2019 when the band signed a management deal with Floating Leaf Entertainment, establishing a joint venture between Wetzel and Jeb Hurt who had previously been the band's agent at Red 11 Music.

''Harold Saul High'' was released in 2019 to mixed reviews,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trigger|date=2019-06-24|title=Album Review – Koe Wetzel's "Harold Saul High"|url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/album-review-koe-wetzels-harold-saul-high/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=Saving Country Music|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Fox|first=Chris|date=2019-06-19|title=Koe Wetzel Earns High Marks in "Harold Saul High" {{!}}|url=http://texasmusicpickers.com/koe-wetzel-earns-high-marks-in-harold-saul-high/|access-date=2021-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kephart|first=Zackary|date=2019-06-27|title=Album Review: Koe Wetzel – 'Harold Saul High'|url=https://themusicaldivide.com/2019/06/27/album-review-koe-wetzel-harold-saul-high/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=The Musical Divide|language=en}}</ref> however sales were strong, and the album charted on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name=":3" />

In 2020, Wetzel released ''Sellout'', named in reference to his signing with major label [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|date=2020-12-01|title=Koe Wetzel Reassures the Masses That He'll Never Change on 'Sellout'|url=https://americansongwriter.com/koe-wetzel-reassures-the-masses-that-hell-never-change-on-sellout/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2023, Wetzel became<ref>{{Cite web|date=2023-01-19|title=Fort Worth hospitality vets partner with musician Koe Wetzel on new country venue|url=https://fortworth.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/koe-wetzel-riot-room-emil-bragdon/|access-date=2024-05-08|website=CultureMap Fort Worth|language=en-US}}</ref> a partner in the opening of a highly successful restaurant-bar and live music review in Fort Worth, Texas called Koe Wetzel's Riot Room.

== Musical style ==
Wetzel's music is usually described as fusing genres, especially rock and country while he has been rumored to personally refer to his blend of music as "Hillbilly Punk-Rock". In his youth, Wetzel was exposed to country, hip-hop, rap, and grunge including the music of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. In an interview for ''[[American Songwriter]]'', Wetzel described his album ''Harold Saul High'' as "...90s country meets early 2000s [[punk rock]] with early ’90s [[grunge]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] music in the background."<ref name=":5" />

His lyrics often deal with mature subject matter, and are known for containing explicit language.<ref name=":1" /> One example is the song "February 28, 2016": a song about drunkenness, and a reference to his arrest for [[public intoxication]] in Stephenville on that day.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Langeler|first=Wes|date=2021-02-28|title=Happy February 28th, AKA Koe Wetzel Day|url=https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2021/02/28/happy-february-28th-aka-koe-wetzel-day/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=Whiskey Riff|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2019, Wetzel's performance at the [[Great Texas Balloon Race]] was the subject of some controversy, after some festival goers were offended at his refusal to make his songs more family friendly. Wetzel responded in a [[Tongue-in-cheek|tongue in cheek]] manner, taking credit for breaking attendance records.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-30|title=Koe Wetzel throws shade at Great Texas Balloon Race over apology|url=https://www.ketk.com/news/local-news/koe-wetzel-throws-shade-at-great-texas-balloon-race-over-apology/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=KETK.com {{!}} FOX51.com|language=en-US}}</ref>
