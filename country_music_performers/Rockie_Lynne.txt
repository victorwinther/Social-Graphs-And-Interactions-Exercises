===Musical career===
He signed to Universal South Records in 2005, releasing his debut single "Lipstick" late that year under the name Rockie Lynne. This song became his first chart single, reaching as high as No.&nbsp;29 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts. It was the first single from his self-titled debut album, which was released in May 2006 via Universal South. The album's other two singles — "Do We Still" and "More" — both missed the Top 40, peaking at No.&nbsp;46 and No.&nbsp;48 respectively, and he exited the label by 2007. An independent album, ''Twilight'', followed in February 2007.

He has made 14 appearances on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry.

In late 2007, he became the first artist signed to Robbins Nashville, a newly established independent label founded by New York City-based Robbins Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=887|title=Rockie Lynne becomes first artist of new label|date=July 4, 2007|work=[[Country Standard Time]]|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref> He charted for the fourth time with the No.&nbsp;49 "I Can't Believe It's Me" in 2008.

As a veteran of the United States Army, he is often requested to perform for patriotic and military events and his original songs are regularly licensed for use in conjunction with veteran and patriotic-themed programming.

He is the founder of a national charitable organization founded in Minnesota, Tribute to the Troops, now in its 11th year.  The organization has four chapters: Minnesota, Illinois, Oregon, North Carolina.  This 501c3 has raised over 300,000 for a college fund designed to provide tuition for children who have lost a parent in active duty.

His original compositions have been included in regional and national network programs, of which highlights include an Emmy Award-winning program produced by Wisconsin Public Television, CBS "Criminal Minds" episodes and "Fox NFL Sunday" broadcast.
