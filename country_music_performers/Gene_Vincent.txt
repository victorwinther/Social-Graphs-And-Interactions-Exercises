'''Vincent Eugene Craddock''' (February 11, 1935 – October 12, 1971), known as '''Gene Vincent''', was an American [[rock and roll]] musician who pioneered the style of [[rockabilly]]. His 1956 top ten hit with his backing band [[the Blue Caps]], "[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly.<ref name=pc8/> His chart career was brief, especially in his home country of the US, where he notched three top 40 hits in 1956 and 1957, and never charted in the top 100 again.  In the UK, he was a somewhat bigger star, racking up eight top 40 hits from 1956 to 1961.

Vincent was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker the "Screaming End".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-12 |title=Gene Vincent: The hero before The Beatles |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/gene-vincent-heror-the-beatles/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|title=GENE VINCENT|first=Ian|last=Chaddock|website=Vivelerock.net|access-date=May 22, 2021|archive-date=December 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228151827/https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Craddock was born February 11, 1935, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=Concise |page=1218}}</ref> to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock.<ref name="musicianguide.com">{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000576/Gene-Vincent.html|title=Gene Vincent Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>  His musical influences included [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. His favorite composition was [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont overture]]. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now [[Virginia Beach]]), in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]], Virginia, near the [[North Carolina]] line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.

Craddock's father volunteered to serve in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German [[U-boat]]s during [[World War II]]. Craddock's mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop.

Craddock dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler {{USS|Chukawan|AO-100|6}}, with a two-week training period in the repair ship {{USS|Amphion|AR-13|6}}, before returning to the ''Chukawan''. He never saw combat but completed a [[Korean War]] deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} but was not part of the ship's company.

Craddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycle. On July 4, 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was shattered in an auto crash.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henderson|first=Derek|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70671058|title=Gene Vincent: a companion|year=2005|publisher=Spent Brothers Productions|isbn=0-9519416-7-4|location=Southampton|page=3|oclc=70671058}}</ref> He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain. He wore a steel sheath as a [[leg brace]]<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean-Éric |last1=Perrin |author-link1=:fr:Jean-Éric Perrin |first2=Jerôme |last2=Rey |first3=Gilles |last3=Verlant |author-link3=Gilles Verlant |title=Les Miscellanées du rock |year=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Fetjaine / La Martinière |page=252 |isbn=978-2-35425-130-7 |quote=Gene choisit de se faire poser une gaine d'acier autour des restes de son membre}}</ref> for the rest of his life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John

===Early music career===
Craddock became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene Vincent and formed a rockabilly band, Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LatestNewsGV.html|title=Official Gene Vincent website|publisher=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=2014-04-24|archive-date=November 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105110313/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LatestNewsGV.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band included Willie Williams on rhythm guitar (replaced in late 1956 by [[Paul Peek]]), Jack Neal on upright bass, Dickie Harrell on drums (died May 31, 2023, at age 82),<ref name="obiDH">{{cite web |url=https://www.lovingfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Richard-Harrell-6/#!/Obituary|title=Richard Dickie Be-Bop Harrell Sr.|date=|accessdate=July 8, 2023|website=lovingfuneralhome.com}}</ref> and [[Cliff Gallup]] on lead guitar.<ref name="Larkin"/> He also collaborated with another rising musician, [[Jay Chevalier]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]]. Vincent and His Blue Caps soon gained a reputation playing in various [[country music|country]] bars in Norfolk. There they won a talent contest organized by a local radio DJ, "Sheriff Tex" Davis, who then became Vincent's manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711034403/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 11, 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London, UK|title=Sheriff Tex Davis|date=September 13, 2007|access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Biggest hits===

"Be-Bop-a-Lula" was not on Vincent's first album and was picked by Capitol producer [[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]] as the B-side of his first single, "Woman Love". Prior to the release of the single, Lowery pressed promotional copies of "Be-Bop-a-Lula" and sent them to radio stations throughout the country. By the time Capitol released the single, "Be-Bop-a-Lula" had already gained attention from the public and radio DJs. The song was picked up and played by other U.S. radio stations (obscuring the original A-side song) and became a hit, peaking at number 7 and spending 20 weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=152}} and reaching number 5 and spending 17 weeks on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' chart,<ref>{{cite web|date=|title=Cash Box Country Singles 11/03/56|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210311111104/http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|archive-date=March 11, 2021|website=CASHBOX Magazine|access-date=March 11, 2021}}</ref> and launching Vincent's career as a rock-and-roll star.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32014167|title=Billboard's hottest hot 100 hits|date=1995|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=0-8230-7646-6|edition=|location=New York|pages=253|oclc=32014167}}</ref>

After "Be-Bop-a-Lula" became a hit, Vincent and His Blue Caps were unable to follow it up with the same level of commercial success, although they released critically acclaimed songs like "Race with the Devil" (number 96 on the ''Billboard'' chart and number 50 on the ''Cash Box'' chart) and "[[Bluejean Bop]]" (number 49 on the ''Billboard'' chart and another million-selling disc).<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

Cliff Gallup left the band in 1956, and Russell Williford joined as the new guitarist for the Blue Caps. Williford played and toured Canada with Vincent in late 1956 but left the group in early 1957. Gallup came back to do the next album and then left again. Williford came back and exited again before Johnny Meeks joined the band.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dregni|first=Michael|date=2019-04-22|title=Cliff Gallup|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/32416/cliff-gallup/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210303103647/https://www.vintageguitar.com/32416/cliff-gallup/|archive-date=March 3, 2021|website=Vintage Guitar® magazine|access-date=March 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Kevin|date=2009-02-01|title=Russell Williford.

Vincent and His Blue Caps also appeared several times on ''[[Town Hall Party]]'', California's largest country music barn dance, held at the Town Hall in Compton, California.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hillbilly-Music.com |url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/programs/story/index.php?prog=170 |title=Town Hall Party|publisher=hillbilly-music.com |access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref> They appeared on October 25, 1958, and July 25 and November 7, 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808469645/details |title=Gene Vincent – At Town Hall Party Production Details|publisher=Movies.yahoo.com|access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref>  However, by the end of 1959 the Blue Caps were no longer part of the billing on Gene Vincent records.  The late 1959 single "Wild Cat" was credited solely to Gene Vincent, and this would be the case on all subsequent Gene Vincent releases.

===Europe===
A dispute with the [[Internal Revenue Service|US tax authorities]] and the American Musicians' Union over payments to his band and his having sold the band's equipment to pay a tax bill led Vincent to leave the United States for Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farren|first=Mick|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/784882138|title=The Mammoth Book of Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll.|publisher=Constable & Robinson|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84901-461-8|editor-last=Driver|editor-first=Jim.|location=London|pages=50–51|chapter=Gene Vincent – The Genesis of the Dark Side|oclc=784882138}}</ref>

On December 15, 1959, Vincent appeared on [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]]'s TV show, ''Boy Meets Girl'', his first appearance in England. He wore black leather, gloves, and a medallion, and stood in a hunched posture.<ref name="Larkin"/> Good is credited with the transformation of Vincent's image.<ref name="Larkin"/> After the TV appearance he toured France, the Netherlands, [[West Germany|Germany]] and the [[UK]] performing in his US stage clothes.<ref>Farren, Mike (2004).

On April 16, 1960, while on tour in the UK, Vincent, [[Eddie Cochran]] and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]]. Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and further damaged his weakened leg.<ref name="Larkin"/> Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day. Vincent returned to the United States after the accident.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While they were preparing to board their taxi, Vincent and Cochran had rebuffed [[Tony Sheridan]]'s request to ride along with them to the next venue. After escaping that fateful road accident,<ref>https://www.rte.ie/radio/doconone/771586-are-you-tony-sheridan Martin Duffy. ''Are You Tony Sheridan?'' (RTÉ [[Doc on One]] radio documentary), 17 July 2010.</ref> Sheridan soon relocated to Hamburg, where he helped influence the musical training of many British groups who would later become part of the [[British Invasion]], including one of his backing bands, [[the Beatles]].

Promoter [[Don Arden]] had Vincent return to the UK in 1961 to do an extensive tour in theatres and ballrooms,<ref name="Larkin"/> including the Agincourt Ballroom, Camberley<ref name=":0">Ronnie Wood (Show) in conversation with Paul McCartney confirmed meeting Vincent at the venue. sky.com/ronnie</ref> with Chris Wayne and the [[The Echoes (English group)|Echoes]].

Vincent toured the UK again in 1963 with the [[The Outlaws (UK band)|Outlaws]], featuring future [[Deep Purple]] guitar player [[Ritchie Blackmore]], as a backing band. Vincent's alcohol problems marred the tour, resulting in problems both on stage and with the band and management.<ref>Bloom, Jerry (2008). ''Black Knight''. Omnibus Press.</ref>

===Later career===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2014}}
Vincent's attempts to re-establish his American career in [[folk rock]] and [[country rock]] proved unsuccessful; he is remembered today for recordings of the 1950s and early 1960s released by [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In the early 1960s, he also put out tracks on EMI's [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, including a cover of [[Arthur Alexander]]'s "Where Have You Been All My Life?" A backing band called the Shouts joined him.

[[File:Genevincent015e.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Vincent, 1967]]
In 1966 and 1967, in the United States, he recorded for [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]], backed by ex-members of the [[the Champs|Champs]] and [[Glen Campbell]]. Challenge released three singles in the US, and the UK [[London Records|London]] label released two singles and collected recordings on to an LP, ''Gene Vincent'', on the UK London label in 1967. Although well received, none sold well. In 1968 in a hotel in Germany, Vincent tried to shoot Paul Raven, later to find fame as [[Gary Glitter]]. He fired several shots but missed and a frightened Raven left the country the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channelhopping.onthebox.com/2012/12/14/regrettable-television-this-your-life-gary-glitter|title=Regrettable Television: This Is Your Life, Gary Glitter|publisher=Channelhopping.onthebox.com|date=December 14, 2012|access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref>
 
In 1969, he recorded the album ''I'm Back and I'm Proud'' for long-time fan [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]],<ref name="Larkin"/> produced by [[Kim Fowley]] with arrangements by [[Skip Battin]] (of the [[the Byrds|Byrds]]), [[Mars Bonfire]] on rhythm guitar, Johnny Meeks (of Blue Caps and Merle Haggard's [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]]) on lead guitar, [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] on drums, and backing vocals by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and Jackie Frisco.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=34}} While recording the track "Sexy Ways" for the album Vincent threatened to get a gun from his car and shoot [[Paul A.

On his 1969 tour of the UK he was backed by the [[The Wild Angels (band)|Wild Angels]], a British band that had performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. Because of pressure from his ex-wife Margaret Russell, the [[Inland Revenue]] and promoter [[Don Arden]], Vincent returned to the US.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagarty|first=Britt|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11869138|title=The day the world turned blue: a biography of Gene Vincent|date=1984|publisher=Blandford|isbn=0-7137-1531-6|location=Poole|pages=245|oclc=11869138}}</ref>

His final US recordings were four tracks for Rockin' Ronny Weiser's Rolling Rock label, a few weeks before his death. These were released on a compilation album of tribute songs, including "Say Mama", by his daughter, Melody Jean Vincent, accompanied by Johnny Meeks on guitar. On 19 September 1971, he began his last series of gigs in Britain.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=4}} He was backed by Richard Cole and Kansas Hook (Dave Bailey, Bob Moore, and bass player Charlie Harrison from Poco and Roger McGuinn's Thunderbyrd). They recorded four tracks ("Say Mama", "Be-Bop-A-Lula", "Roll Over Beethoven", "[[Distant Drums (song)|Distant Drums]]") at the BBC studios in [[Maida Vale]], London, for [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker's]] [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show. The fifth record ("[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]") remained unfinished.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=36}} He managed one show at the Garrick Night Club in [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], [[Lancashire]], and two shows at the Wookey Hollow Club in [[Liverpool]] on October 3 and 4. Vincent then returned to the US and died a few days later. In September, 1974, BBC launched pop label BEEB with a maxi single by Vincent ("Roll Over Beethoven", BEEB 001). The single comprised three of these tracks.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=BBC's BEEB to Bow With Maxi-Single |url= |magazine=Billboard |location= |publisher= |date=1974-09-14|page=56 |access-date=}}</ref> The four tracks are now on Vincent's album ''White Lightning''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Writing for [[AllMusic]], [[Ritchie Unterberger]] called Vincent "an American rockabilly legend who defined the greasy-haired, leather-jacketed, hot rods 'n' babes spark of rock and roll."<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Ritchie|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-vincent-mn0000803720|title=Gene Vincent|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] was less impressed by the musician's career, saying "Vincent was never a titan – his few moments of rockabilly greatness were hyped-up distillations of slavering lust from a sensitive little guy who was just as comfortable with 'Over the Rainbow' in his normal frame of mind." However, he included Vincent's [[compilation album]] ''The Bop That Just Won't Stop'' (1974) in his "basic record library", published in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981).<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: V|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=V&bk=70|access-date=March 21, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>
