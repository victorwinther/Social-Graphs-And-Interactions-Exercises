==Personal life==
The Hunter Brothers are a Canadian country band consisting of 5 brothers from Shaunavon, Saskatchewan: Luke, J.J., Ty, Brock, and Dusty. Their parents are Lorne and Norma Hunter,<ref name="mercury">{{Cite web|url=http://www.estevanmercury.ca/news/arts-entertainment/hunter-brothers-seeking-traction-on-country-and-western-circuit-1.2182127|title=Hunter Brothers seeking traction on country and western circuit|date=2016-02-24|website=www.estevanmercury.ca|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> and their uncle [[Jim Hunter (skier)|Jim Hunter]] is a Canadian Olympic skier.<ref name="vegas-sun">{{Cite web|url=https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/oct/04/canadians-hockey-dreams-lead-las-vegas/|title=Canadian's hockey dreams lead to Las Vegas|date=2008-10-04|website=www.lasvegassun.com/|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>

These brothers grew up farming in the Canadian prairies. They spent their summers singing in churches across the country. In the Winter, they were heavily involved in the hockey community. Some of the brothers even played for some major league teams.

When the 5 brothers are at home working on the farm, they often pass the time in the field by re-writing well known songs with words that are relevant to farming culture, performing them over their CB radios. They often share these songs online through their various social media platforms.

==Hockey Careers==
Four of the five brothers played [[junior ice hockey]] and three played in the professional [[minor leagues]]. J.J., Dustin, and Luke each played forward, while Brock and Ty were [[defenceman|defencemen]]. Ty played rep hockey before suffering a broken femur.<ref name="mercury" /> The remaining four brothers all sustained injuries of various kinds and returned home to continue farming with their parents on their family's 20,000 acre farm.<ref name="vegas-sun" />

J.J. Hunter played three seasons in [[Western Hockey League]] with the [[Kelowna Rockets]] and [[Prince Albert Raiders]]; he attended six NHL training camps (1999 Detroit Red Wings, 2001-2006 Edmonton Oilers) and was under contract with the Edmonton Oilers for 5 seasons playing NHL pre-season games and five years in their farm system. Altogether, he played 6 years of pro-hockey including parts of six seasons in the [[American Hockey League]] with the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]], [[Toronto Roadrunners]], [[Edmonton Road Runners]], [[Toronto Marlies]] and [[Manitoba Moose]]; and parts of four season in the [[ECHL]] with the [[Toledo Storm]] and [[Columbus Cottonmouths]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=45154|title=J.J. Hunter hockey statistics and profile|date=|website=www.hockeydb.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>

Dustin Hunter played junior hockey with the [[Melville Millionaires]] in the [[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]], then one professional season split between the [[Oklahoma City Blazers (1992–2009)|Oklahoma City Blazers]] and [[San Angelo Saints]] in the [[Central Hockey League]] before his career was abruptly ended due to a severe eye injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=73308|title=Dustin Hunter hockey statistics and profile|date=|website=www.hockeydb.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>

== Music career ==
===Early years===
Music has always brought these 5 brothers together. When they were younger, they spent their time mirroring music videos from other artists, and learning to become performers. What emerged was an organic pop-country sound. The Hunter Brothers quickly became known for their harmonies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.estevanmercury.ca/news/arts-entertainment/hunter-brothers-seeking-traction-on-country-and-western-circuit-1.2182127|title=Hunter Brothers seeking traction on country and western circuit|last=Park|first=Norm|website=Estevan Mercury|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> and stage presence.

===2016–2018: ''Getaway''===
In 2016, the brothers started recording a collection of songs with their label [[Open Road Recordings]]. On February 5, 2016 they released their debut single “El Dorado” to country radio<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.openroadrecordings.com/albums/hunter-brothers-eldorado/|title=Hunter Brothers – El Dorado – Open Road Recordings|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02|archive-date=2020-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814101818/https://openroadrecordings.com/albums/hunter-brothers-eldorado/|url-status=dead}}</ref> which helped put this new band on the map within the Canadian country music industry.

In the Spring of 2017, the Hunter Brothers released their debut album ''Getaway''. This album included two singles that earned them their first two songs that entered the top 10 on the Billboard charts: “Born and Raised”, and “[[Those Were the Nights]]”.

Their single "[[Born and Raised (song)|Born and Raised]]" from their ''Getaway'' album was selected as the official anthem for the 2018 IIHF [[World Junior Hockey Championship|World Junior Hockey]] Tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/news/2019-wjc-hunter-brothers-born-and-raised-in-hockey|title=Born and raised|website=www.hockeycanada.ca|language=en-ca|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> “Born and Raised” also won Saskatchewan Music Award for Single of the Year.
