'''Emilio H. Navaira III''' (August 23, 1962 – May 16, 2016) was an American singer-songwriter of [[Tejano music|Tejano]] and [[country music]]. He is the winner of one [[Grammy Award]] and one [[Latin Grammy Award]].

Known to most by the [[Mononymous person|mononym]] '''Emilio''', he charted more than ten singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Latin Tracks]] charts, in addition to six singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. Emilio was also one of the few Tejano artists to have significant success in both the United States and Mexico, and was called the "[[Garth Brooks]] of Tejano". His biggest country hit was the No. 27 "It's Not the End of the World" in late 1995, and his highest-charting single on any chart is "Por Siempre Unidos," which peaked at No. 7 on [[Latin Pop Airplay]] in 1996. Along with [[Selena]], Emilio was one of the most prominent artists that helped popularize Tejano music.<ref name=npr/>

==Early life==
Emilio H. Navaira III was born on August 23, 1962, in [[San Antonio]], Texas, to Mexican-American parents, Emilio Navaira, Jr. and Maria Hernandez.<ref>Burr, Ramiro. (August 21, 1998) [[San Antonio Express-News]] ''Colombian cumbias; Emilio's birthday bash.'' Section: Weekender; Page 22H.</ref> Growing up on the south side of San Antonio, Navaira found each influence in not only Tejano legends such as [[Little Joe y la Familia]], but also Lone Star country music heroes such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Bob Wills]], and [[George Strait]]. As a student, Navaira graduated from [[McCollum High School]] in 1980, received a music scholarship to [[Texas State University]], and majored in music with plans to become a teacher before ultimately deciding to pursue a career as an artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/navaira_emilio/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926102632/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/navaira_emilio/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 26, 2008|title=Emilio Navaira Bio – Emilio Navaira Career|work=MTV Artists}}</ref>

==Musical career==
In 1983 at age 21, Emilio began his performing career by singing lead vocals for [[David Lee Garza|David Lee Garza y Los Musicales]]. In 1987, Cuantas Veces by David Lee Garza Y Los Musicales beat out Alpha by [[Mexican American]] singer [[Selena]] for Album of the Year at the [[Tejano Music Awards]]. In 1989, Navaira formed his own band, Emilio y Grupo Rio.<ref name="kings">Hinojosa, Cassandra. (February 20, 2004) [[Corpus Christi Caller-Times]] ''Two Tejano kings. Grammy winners Navaira, Little Joe visit Kingsville'' Section: Weekend; Page E4.</ref> That same year Emilio signed with [[Columbia Records]] (then known as [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]]). This relationship resulted in Emilio recording more than fifteen studio albums to date, including several with his Rio Band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emilio Navaira {{!}} Album Discography {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/emilio-navaira-mn0000798858/discography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 22, 2016}}</ref>

By the mid 1990s, Emilio began crediting himself solely as Emilio, eventually switching his focus to country music.<ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Emilio.html |title=Emilio biography |access-date=November 12, 2007 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> Between 1989 and 1996, Emilio had released seven Spanish albums with cumulative sales of about 2 million.<ref name="corsses">DeVault, Russ.

Emilio signed with [[Capitol Records]] and released his first country music single called "It's Not the End of the World" which reached the Top 30 on the country charts in 1995. His album was a surprise success as well reaching No. 13 on the country charts and also a high placing on the Top 200. Several more singles including a Spanish version of "It's Not the End of the World" followed but none of these singles came close to the Top 40 except "Even If I Tried" which reached No. 41 in 1996. In 1997, he released a second country album, "It's on the House" but it was not as successful as his first country album. Two more minor country singles followed and gradually Emilio faded from country music and increasingly came back to Tejano music.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carlin|first1=Richard|title=Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary|date=2003|isbn=9781135361112|pages=124–125|publisher=Routledge }}</ref>
