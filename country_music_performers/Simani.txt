'''Simani''' (''pronounced "Sim 'n' I"'') was a [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] musical duet considered the cornerstone of traditional [[Music of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland music]]. Formed in 1977 by Bud Davidge and Sim Savory (November 29, 1946 &ndash; March 16, 2010), in [[Belleoram]], [[Fortune Bay]], their music keeps Newfoundland's unique heritage alive by putting old stories to song and by their recording of local jigs and reels. Their music is characterized by the [[Folk music|folk]]sy sound of [[Music of Newfoundland and Labrador|their native province]], including [[Celts|Celtic]], [[England|English]], and [[France|French]] influences.<ref name="gm100402">{{cite news |first=Joan |last=Sullivan |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Newfoundlander's 'little thing' was a big success |url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20100402.OBSAVORY02ATL//TPStory/Obituaries |date=April 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

It is believed that the name "Simani" is derived from someone asking Davidge who was playing that night at the local Legion, Davidge replied, "Sim and I". By the time the music began that night, the name was already set.

==History==
Davidge and Savory both knew each other growing up - Savory was in [[Belleoram]] and Davidge was in nearby [[Bay du Nord, Fortune Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bay du Nord]]. Savory was a natural and gifted musician and was always playing in bands. In 1970, after living and working in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] for some time, Savory moved back to Belleoram. Davidge was working with the school board at that time. A few years after that, which was a time when Savory wasn't in a band, they got together and decided to play a few tunes. One thing led to another, and in May 1977, they decided to play a gig in Belleoram at an old fisherman's lodge called The Schooner Lounge. The gig earned them about $20. Both critics and the general public enjoyed the bands so much that they decided to play more gigs. In 1981, four years after that initial performance in Belleoram, Davidge and Savory had written enough material that it was suggested the duo record an album, which they eventually did in [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Stephenville]].

Nearly all of Simani's recorded songs are originals, written by Davidge (who was also the vocalist for the group). Savory was a gifted musician, being a master of many instruments, as well as a very talented sound engineer. That variety of talent worked very well for Simani, and it showed in the quality of their recordings.

In a musical career that lasted 20 years, Simani were stars with major radio airplay and sold-out shows wherever they performed. Since their first recording "Saltwater Cowboys" in 1981, they have produced 12 recordings. Simani defined a sound that became predominant in many recording that were done in Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1980s. Their first few albums were recorded at Clode Sound in Stephenville and the remainder recorded at Sim's studio in Belleoram.

Simani is famous for their "Saltwater Cowboys" song, a song about Outward migration, a subject most people from Newfoundland are all too familiar with, and the effects that an outside culture has on Newfoundlanders who leave and then return home.

Simani is also well known for their Christmas mega-hit "Any Mummers Allowed In?". Before Davidge and Savory produced this song, the Christmas tradition of [[Mummering]] was declining. After its release in 1984, Mummering made a return to all parts of Newfoundland.<ref name="tel071228">{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartlett |work=[[The Telegram]] |title=Mummers song turns 25 |url=http://www.thewesternstar.com/Entertainment/2007-12-28/article-1468009/Mummers-song-turns-25/1 |date=December 28, 2007 |accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/canada/newfoundland-and-labrador/experiences/news/are-mummers-allowed-in-the-newfoundland-holiday-tradition-where-disguised-visitors-drink-dance-and-swing-your-granny|title=Are Mummers Allowed in?

===Later years===
Simani gave up touring in 1997. However, Davidge and Savory still worked toward the advancement of traditional Newfoundland music, with both men recording projects individually. On March 16, 2010, Savory died after battling a lengthy illness. Despite the deterioration of his health, Savory spent the last few months of his life working in the music industry in Newfoundland that he helped redefine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Simani cofounder Savory mourned|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/simani-cofounder-savory-mourned-1.922153|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref>

Prior to his death, Savory would help aspiring artists with their recording experience at his state of the art recording facility in Belleoram.<ref name="gm100402"/>

Davidge was later the owner and operator of a cassette tape and CD-ROM duplication facility at [[English Harbour West]], just eight kilometers from Belleoram.<ref name="gm100402"/><ref name="coas">[http://www.thecoaster.ca/index.cfm?sid=191240&sc=319 The Coaster] {{Dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Davidge was elected to the Memorial University Board of Regents as an alumni representative in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gazette.mun.ca/campus-and-community/results-are-in/|title= Results are in: Alumni elected to Board of Regents, highest participation to date|date=Jun 22, 2017|publisher=Memorial University Gazette|accessdate=Jan 17, 2021 }}</ref>
