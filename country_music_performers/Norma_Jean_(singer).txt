==Biography==
===Early life and rise to fame===
Norma Jean Beasler was born in [[Wellston, Oklahoma]], United States,<ref name="AMG"/> and grew up admiring country singer [[Kitty Wells]], whom she considered her biggest influence. She got her start performing on radio stations in the [[Oklahoma City]] area; and by age 12, she had her own radio show on [[KRMP|KLPR-AM]]. She toured Oklahoma with various bands, starting with [[Merl Lindsay]] and His Oklahoma Night Riders at age 16, followed by the Bill Gray Band at 18.<ref name="AMG"/> Norma Jean was the Bill Gray Band's full-time vocalist, and made guest appearances with major country stars. Early on, she befriended soon-to-be country star [[Wanda Jackson]].

In 1955, she got a regular spot on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] show ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where she stayed for two years and first received national exposure.<ref name="AMG"/> Host [[Red Foley]] suggested calling her simply Norma Jean, and she made it official in 1958;<ref>Sachs, Bill "Folk Tunes & Talent" (June 30, 1958), ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The ''Billboard'']], p. 46</ref> she also became known on the program as '''Pretty Miss Norma Jean'''. She met [[Porter Wagoner]] on the show, and in 1959, signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="AMG"/> A string of unsuccessful singles followed, and she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where Wagoner invited her to audition for his syndicated weekly TV program, ''The Porter Wagoner Show''.<ref name="AMG"/> She became a regular on the show in 1961 and stayed for six years.<ref>{{cite web

Norma Jean toured and performed across the country with Wagoner, and RCA Victor producer [[Chet Atkins]] signed her to a recording contract with RCA Victor.<ref name="AMG"/>

===Success in the 1960s===
In 1963, Norma Jean released her first single with RCA Victor, "Let's Go All the Way".<ref name="AMG"/> The song peaked at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' country chart.<ref name="AMG"/> She released an album of the same name which spawned two more Top 40 hits, "I'm a Walking Advertisement (For the Blues)"<ref name="AMG"/> followed by "Put Your Arm Around Her."

In late 1965, she released an album titled, ''Pretty Miss Norma Jean'' (titled after how Wagoner frequently introduced her on his television show).<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=292/3}}</ref> It was the most successful of her career, hitting number three on the Top Country Albums list. The first single from the album, "Go Cat Go", became a Top 10 hit, peaking at number eight.<ref name="AMG"/> Two more singles were released, starting with "I Cried All the Way to the Bank," which also proved successful. After that, "I Wouldn't Buy a Used Car From Him", written by [[Harlan Howard]], was another Top 10 hit, making her one of the most popular female country singers of the era.<ref name="AMG"/>

From 1965 to 1967, Norma Jean produced a series of solid country singles and albums and continued to appear on Wagoner's show.<ref name="AMG"/> On television she projected a wholesome image, contrary to her singing hurting and cheating songs relevant to her personal life, which included an affair with Wagoner.<ref name="AMG"/>

Norma's biggest hit came in 1966. It was an unusual recording with [[Bobby Bare]] and [[Liz Anderson]], "The Game of Triangles", a wife-husband-other woman drama that hit number five on the ''Billboard'' chart,<ref name="AMG"/> and earned the trio a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination.

Norma Jean left Wagoner's show in 1967 after marrying Jody Taylor<ref name="AMG"/> (whom she later divorced), and was replaced by newcomer [[Dolly Parton]], who went on to become one of country music's leading female stars.  Parton said later she had a hard time replacing Norma Jean, because she was so loved by country fans.

That year, her single, "Heaven Help the Working Girl" (an early feminist song) was a Top 20 hit, the last one of her career.<ref name="AMG"/> Despite a lack of major country hits, her albums continued to sell, like 1967's ''Jackson Ain't a Very Big Town'', which peaked at number 11 on the Top Country Albums list.  She later struggled with alcoholism and became a [[born again]] Christian.<ref name="AMG"/>
