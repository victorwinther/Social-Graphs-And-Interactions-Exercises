==Career==
The group's founding members were lead vocalist Frank Gilligan (born November 2, 1955<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=225|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref>) and guitarist Rick Henderson (born May 29, 1953<ref name="whitburn"/>), respectively natives of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Texas]], who met while attending [[Lamar University]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]].<ref name="paris"/> The two joined with guitarist Jerry Dengler (born May 29, 1955<ref name="whitburn"/>), a former solo artist from [[Odessa, Texas]], and officially founded the band in 1979.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mason-dixon-mn0002141765 | title=Mason Dixon biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=March 1, 2021}}</ref> The group's first release was a single titled "Armadillo Country". After this song became a regional hit, record producer Don Schafer signed the band to his Texas Records label. The band released its debut album  ''Only a Dream Away'' in 1983 and released five singles from it. First was a cover of [[The Police]]'s "[[Every Breath You Take]]", followed by "Mason Dixon Lines", "I Never Had a Chance with You", "Gettin' Over You", and the album's title track. All of these songs except for "Mason Dixon Lines" made the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> "Mason Dixon Lines" was also the band's first [[music video]].<ref name="paris">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/9771387/ | title=Mason Dixon making return appearance in Paris Saturday | work=The Paris News | date=April 8, 1984 | accessdate=March 1, 2021 | pages=3C}}</ref> A second Texas Records album, ''The Spirit of Texas'', charted the single "Houston Heartache" in 1985.<ref name="whitburn"/>

This album went on to account for their first top-40 hit on Hot Country Songs that year with "3935 West End Avenue".<ref name="whitburn"/> The success of this song led to them being signed by [[Capitol Records]], who issued their next album  ''Exception to the Rule'' in 1988. Its title track was the band's highest-charting single, reaching number 35 on Hot Country Songs in 1988.<ref name="whitburn"/> Another single from the album, "When Karen Comes Around", was also made into a music video which aired on [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/432840707/ | title=Mason Dixon popular with fans | work=Victoria Advocate | date=March 1, 1992 | accessdate=March 1, 2021 | pages=5}}</ref>

Henderson left the group in 1989 and was replaced by Terry "Caz" Casburn (vocals, bass). A second album for Capitol, ''Reach for It'', was completed but never released.<ref name="allmusic"/>

After Mason Dixon disbanded in 1993, Gilligan moved to [[Tomball, Texas]] and held various jobs.
