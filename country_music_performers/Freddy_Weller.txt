{{Main|Paul Revere & the Raiders#The "Happening" era}}
His recording career continued in 1967, as lead guitarist in the band [[Paul Revere & The Raiders]].<ref name="LarkinCountry" />  Around the time he joined the band, the group's two main members, [[Mark Lindsay]] and [[Paul Revere (musician)|Paul Revere]], had just started hosting the show ''[[Happening '68]]''. The other Raiders members, Charlie Coe, [[Keith Allison]], and Joe Correro Jr, acted as the show's in-studio houseband. He penned their 1969 hit "We Gotta All Get Together".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Collage - The Raiders &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/collage-mw0000845946 |access-date=August 11, 2021 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

Weller remained in the Raiders until its split in 1975. The group soon reformed without Weller.

=== Solo ===
Weller recorded many rock and roll and country songs, such as Joe South's "[[Games People Play (Joe South song)|'Games People Play]]", which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1969;<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Promised Land (Chuck Berry song)|The Promised Land]]" and "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]", "She Loves Me Right Out Of My Mind", "[[Indian Lake (song)|Indian Lake]]", both 1971, and many others.
