'''Little Big Town''' is an American [[country music]] vocal group from [[Homewood, Alabama]]. Founded in 1998, the group has had the same four members since its founding: Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman (née Roads), Phillip Sweet, and Jimi Westbrook. Their musical style relies heavily on four-part vocal harmonies, with all four members alternating as lead vocalists. Fairchild and Westbrook have been married to each other since 2006.

After a recording deal with the [[Mercury Nashville Records]] label which produced no singles or albums, Little Big Town released its [[Little Big Town (album)|self-titled debut]] on [[Monument Records]] in 2002. It produced two minor country chart singles before the group left the label. In 2005, the group signed to [[Equity Music Group]], an independent record label owned by [[Clint Black]]. Their second album, ''[[The Road to Here]]'', was released that year, and received a [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). ''[[A Place to Land (Little Big Town album)|A Place to Land]]'', their third album, was released via Equity, then re-released via [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]] after Equity closed in 2008. Six more albums followed for Capitol: ''[[The Reason Why]]'' (2010), ''[[Tornado (Little Big Town album)|Tornado]]'' (2012),  ''[[Pain Killer (Little Big Town album)|Pain Killer]]'' (2014), ''[[The Breaker (Little Big Town album)|The Breaker]]'' (2017), ''[[Nightfall (Little Big Town album)|Nightfall]]'' (2020) and ''[[Mr. Sun]]'' (2022), four of which have reached number one on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart.

Their albums accounted for 24 singles on [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]], including the No.&nbsp;1 singles "[[Pontoon (song)|Pontoon]]", and "[[Better Man (Little Big Town song)|Better Man]]" along with the top 10 hits "[[Boondocks (song)|Boondocks]]", "[[Bring It On Home (Little Big Town song)|Bring It On Home]]", "[[Little White Church]]", "[[Tornado (song)|Tornado]]", "[[Day Drinking]]", and "[[Girl Crush]]".

==Early years==
Fairchild and Schlapman met at [[Samford University]] in 1987, where they both sang in the school's vocal ensembles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.samford.edu/news/2007/Little-Big-Town-To-Perform-at-Homecoming|title=Little Big Town To Perform at Homecoming|website=Samford.edu|access-date=December 21, 2020}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, Fairchild sang with the Christian vocal group [[Truth (American band)|Truth]] and was featured as a lead singer in a few of their songs. She formed a duo called KarenLeigh with Leigh Cappillino, a member of Truth who joined the group [[Point of Grace]]. KarenLeigh produced the singles, "Save It for a Rainy Day" and "This Love Has". Fairchild and Schlapman moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they reunited and began singing together.<ref name="today">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2006-10-17-otv-little-big-town_x.htm |title=Success no longer on Town's outskirts |access-date=2007-12-16 |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |date=2006-10-22 |work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> Westbrook joined Schlapman and Fairchild in 1998, followed by Sweet.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===2005-2009: ''The Road to Here'' and ''A Place to Land''===
In 2005, Little Big Town was signed to [[Equity Music Group]], a label started and partially owned by country music singer [[Clint Black]].<ref name="today"/> Their third single, "[[Boondocks (song)|Boondocks]]", was released in May, peaking at No. 9 on the country charts in January 2006.

Unlike their first album, the group's members co-wrote the majority of the songs on ''The Road to Here'' along with [[Wayne Kirkpatrick]], who also produced it. In 2007, the group sang backing vocals on [[John Mellencamp]]'s ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/freedoms-road-mw0000452378|title=Freedom's Road - John Mellencamp - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Thom Jurek|work=AllMusic|access-date=December 19, 2014}}</ref>

==Musical stylings==
Little Big Town's musical stylings are defined by four-part vocal harmonies. Unlike most vocal groups, Little Big Town does not feature a definitive lead vocalist.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p529622|pure_url=yes}} |title=Little Small Town biography |access-date=2007-12-16 |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Instead, their songs are either led by any one of the four members, or by all four in varying combinations (such as on "Boondocks" and "Life in a Northern Town").
