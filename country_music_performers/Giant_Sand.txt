Howe Gelb, also a prolific solo artist, started the group as Giant Sandworms in the late 1970s in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. In 1980, an EP was released entitled ''Will Wallow and Roam After the Ruin.'' After which Gelb sacked the other members.<ref name="LarkinGE" /> 1983 saw the release of ''Valley of Rain'' on [[Enigma Records]] with the shortened name of Giant Sand. It had Scott Garber on bass, Winston Watson on drums for most tracks, with Tommy Larkins drumming on the others.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Perlich |first=Tim |date=2018-08-09 |title=Giant Sand Returns To Valley Of Rain |url=https://theperlichpost.blogspot.com/2018/08/giant-sand-returns-to-valley-of-rain.html |access-date=2023-08-12 |website=The Perlich Post}}</ref> By 1990, John Convertino had become the band's drummer.
