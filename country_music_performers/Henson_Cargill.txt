His music career began in [[Oklahoma]] in clubs around [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].  He earned national recognition after getting a [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] producer to agree to produce "Skip a Rope".

Cargill had a number of Top 20 hits including "Row Row Row" (1968), "None of My Business", and "The Most Uncomplicated Goodbye I Ever Heard" (1970). Later hits included "Some Old California Memory" and "Silence on the Line". He also had a television show and performed for many years in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Las Vegas]].

==Early life==
Cargill was born in [[Oklahoma City]], United States.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His family was active in politics and raised bison on a ranch outside Oklahoma City, where his grandfather, [[O. A. Cargill]], served as [[List of mayors of Oklahoma City|mayor]] in the 1920s. Cargill graduated from [[Northwest Classen High School]].  Marrying his high school sweetheart, Marta, he moved to [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], in the early 1960s to study [[veterinary medicine]] at [[Colorado State University]]. Returning to Oklahoma City, he worked as a court clerk, private investigator, and deputy sheriff.<ref>[http://www.edmondsun.com/obituaries/x519218012/Henson-Cargill/print "Henson Cargill, 1941–2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430163949/https://obituaries.edmondsun.com/ |date=April 30, 2020 }}, ''[[Edmond Sun]]'', March 27, 2007.</ref>

==Music career==
Cargill began his music career playing in clubs in and around [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]. While working the late shift as a deputy sheriff, Cargill received a visit from his friend and fellow musician Johnny Johnson, who told him of a seasoned and professional vocal group he had been recording with. Henson began recording locally at the Sully Studios with the Kimberleys as backup. They began to tour together all over the west.

In the mid 1960s, Cargill went to Nashville and recorded "Skip A Rope".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He released his album on the [[Monument Records|Monument]] Label in 1967 and immediately scored in a big way with this first release.  The song became a hit, spending five weeks at No. 1 on the country chart in 1968, and also making his only Top 25 appearance on the pop charts (making him a one-hit wonder in the pop music field).<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> This success generated much media attention, and he was in demand on such TV programs as ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' to ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.

After "Skip a Rope", Cargill continued to have Top 20 hits with such songs as "Row Row Row" (1968), "None of My Business" (his only other Top 10) (1969), and "The Most Uncomplicated Goodbye I Ever Heard" (1970).<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  He hosted a television show, ''Country Hayride'', beginning in 1962, and performed for many years in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Las Vegas]]. [[Johnny Cash]] was godfather to his oldest son, Cash. After leaving Monument Records, Henson moved to [[Mega Records]] in 1971, where he scored several minor hits. In 1973, he made a strong comeback to the charts when he signed with [[Atlantic Records]] and scored two Top 30 hits in 1974 with "Some Old California Memory"<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and a version of [[Mac Davis]]' hit song "[[Stop and Smell the Roses (song)|Stop and Smell the Roses]]". In 1980, he formed his own record label Copper Mountain Records and he scored his last Top 30 hit that year with "Silence on the Line".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Cargill was one of the earliest guests on Bill Aken's radio show "The Country Call Line" in the mid-1980s, appearing uncompensated to help launch the show. He performed a half-hour segment with his story of 'Buford The Buffalo'. In 1981, Henson gave up touring to open an Oklahoma City nightclub, "Henson's."

==Later life and death==
In the late 1980s, he retired to [[Oklahoma City]], where he wed Sharon Simms on September 8, 1988.  He died in Oklahoma City on March 24, 2007, aged 66, during surgery.<ref name="auto"/>
