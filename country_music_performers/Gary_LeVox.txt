==Personal life==
LeVox has been friends with [[Jamie Foxx]] since the mid-1990s, and Foxx made a guest appearance on the album ''[[Still Feels Good]]''.<ref name=DEP/>

{{blockquote|"We used to sit around for hours at Jamie’s house, singing and playing and having a good time...So when Jay and Joe and myself wrote this song, we thought it would be great to have him on it. I called him up just to say, ‘Hey, man, you’ve got to hear this song. I think you could really, really kill it.’ He said, ‘Tell you what. I’ll sing on your record if you guys will sing on mine.’ I said, ‘All right.’"|Gary LeVox (2007)<ref name=DEP/>}}

LeVox was employed in his local burger bar from age 14 after which he started an [[AC/DC]] cover band with his close childhood friends. 
 
LeVox has been married to Tara Vernon since May 1999. He says it was love at first sight when they met backstage at a gospel festival concert. "I knew at that moment that I was looking at my future wife," he said in a 2011 interview. "It was the weirdest thing ever." They have two daughters together, Brittany, born in 2000, and Brooklyn, born in 2004.
