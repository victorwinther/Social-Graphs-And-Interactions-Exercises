==Personal life and career beginnings==
Lindi Ortega was born on May 28, 1979<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=736404519928627200|user=lindiortega|title=It's my birthday in ten minutes...|author=Lindi Ortega|date=May 27, 2016|access-date=July 19, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1681734751470911488|user=lindiortega|title=... I am proudly my 44 years of age! ...|author=Lindi Ortega|date=July 19, 2023|access-date=July 19, 2023}}</ref> and is from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She is of Mexican-Irish descent. She was 17 when&nbsp;– after picking up the guitar that hung on the wall of the family home&nbsp;– she wrote "Faded Dress", which she has said was "the first in a long line of heartbreak songs". It was about her first boyfriend dumping her the day before the prom. "I wrote about the dress hanging in the closet, that never got worn. It was sad, but I thought it would be better the next year. But nobody asked me."<ref name="guardian 2014">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/27/country-musician-lindi-ortega|title=Country musician Lindi Ortega: 'I'm a kickass thing'|last=Simpson|first=Dave|date=2014-01-27|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-12}}</ref>

Ortega spent years trawling around record labels as the Toronto scene dubbed her "Indie Lindi". In 2008, she signed to major label Interscope, releasing one EP before they directed their resources into something more conventionally radio-friendly. Ortega remembers "singing my heart out for suits with BlackBerries. Your emotions are all over the place&nbsp;– and they're staring at the ceiling."<ref name="guardian 2014"/>

After a decade of making ends meet by working in pizza places and fleamarkets, in 2011, she signed to Last Gang.<ref name="guardian 2014"/>

In 2017, Ortega married Daniel Huscroft.<ref name="marrying tweet">{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/lindiortega/status/912416176386473984 |title=Tweet by Lindi Ortega |last=Ortega |first=Lindi |work=Twitter |date=2017-09-25 |accessdate=2023-01-03 |quote=So..

==Albums==
===''The Taste of Forbidden Fruit''===
Ortega's debut album, ''The Taste of Forbidden Fruit'', was released in 2001. In her review of the album, Coreen Wolanski of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' described Ortega's voice as "the closest thing to vocal perfection"  she had heard in a long time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=852&fid1=11174&csid1=40 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707202111/http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=852&fid1=11174&csid1=40 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-07 |title=Lindi The Taste of Forbidden Fruit |last=Wolanski |first=Coreen |magazine=[[Exclaim!]] |date=April 2002 |accessdate=June 28, 2010 }}</ref> [[CBC Radio 3]] described the album as follows:

{{blockquote|Lindi seasons her musical scores like a deranged chef whipping up a culinary creation. A dash of country, a pinch of folk, a sprinkle of rock, and a smidgeon of jazz! Last but not least, to add a little spice, how about some vaudeville cabaret? No, this is not a textbook recipe, but rather a mystical scribbling from an ancient scroll. Lindi is enigmatic and enchanting with a voice that can be cheeky and brassy or haunting and ghostly. Her music derives from the metaphysical in a sphere that warps time and defies orthodoxy. This madness is a pure passion that has never met the technicalities of music theory.<ref>{{cite web
