'''Terri Lynn Sauson''', known professionally as '''Terri Clark''' (born August 5, 1968) is a Canadian [[country music]] singer who has had success in both Canada and the United States. Signed to [[Mercury Records]] in 1995, she released her [[Terri Clark (album)|self-titled debut]] that year. Both it and its two follow-ups, 1996's ''[[Just the Same]]'' and 1998's ''[[How I Feel (album)|How I Feel]]'', were certified platinum in both countries, and produced several Top Ten country hits.

Her fourth album, 2000's ''[[Fearless (Terri Clark album)|Fearless]]'', though certified gold in Canada, was not as successful in the U.S., producing no Top 10 hits. ''[[Pain to Kill]]'' from 2003 restored her chart momentum in the U.S. with "[[I Just Wanna Be Mad]]" and "[[I Wanna Do It All]]", while a 2004 greatest hits album produced the Number One "[[Girls Lie Too]]". A non-album single, "The World Needs a Drink", and the 2005 album ''[[Life Goes On (Terri Clark album)|Life Goes On]]'' were her last releases for Mercury before she signed to [[BNA Records]] in 2007. There, she released the singles "[[Dirty Girl (Terri Clark song)|Dirty Girl]]" and "[[In My Next Life]]". Although the latter went to Number One in Canada, she has not released an album for BNA.

Clark's albums have accounted for more than twenty singles, including six Number Ones. "[[If I Were You (Terri Clark song)|If I Were You]]", "[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]",<ref>[http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/weekend-post/you-oughta-juno-what-happened-to-those-artists-voted-most-likely-to-succeed-part-1-1986-1999 "You oughta Juno: What happened to those artists voted most likely to succeed?

''National Post'', David Berry and Rebecca Tucker | March 14, 2015</ref> "[[Emotional Girl]]" and "[[In My Next Life]]" all topped the country charts in Canada (the former three were also U.S. Top Ten singles), "Girls Lie Too" reached number one only in the U.S., and "[[You're Easy on the Eyes]]" was number one in both countries.

In 2004, Clark gained one of country music's crowning achievements when she became a [[List of Grand Ole Opry members|member]] of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. She was inducted into the [[Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2018 and became a member of the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benchetrit |first=Jenna |title=These are the inductees of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/canadian-music-hall-of-fame-class-of-2023-1.6848838|access-date=2023-05-19|website=[[CBC News|CBC]]|language=en}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Clark was born Terri Lynn Sauson on August 5, 1968, in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada. Her family eventually settled in [[Medicine Hat]], Alberta, where she was raised. She is the second of four children: she has a younger brother, Peter, an older sister, Kim, and younger sister, Tina.  Clark's grandparents, Ray and Betty Gauthier, were both noted Canadian country musicians, having opened for artists such as [[George Jones]] and [[Johnny Cash]].<ref name=terri>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymgWAAAAIBAJ&pg=7010,6057478&dq=terri+clark|title=Having Roots In Classic Country Paid Off For Terri Clark |access-date=2009-09-06|publisher=[[Star-News|Morning Star]]}}</ref> Clark's mother, Linda, had belonged to the Canadian folk scene. Her parents divorced when she was young and her mother remarried, with Terri taking on her stepfather's last name.

By high school, Clark had grown to love country music and worked at a local Chinese restaurant to save money to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=terri/> After graduating from [[Crescent Heights High School (Medicine Hat)|Crescent Heights High School]] in 1987, she moved to Nashville where she got her start playing at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a honky-tonk bar across the alley from Nashville's iconic [[Ryman Auditorium]]. At that time, country music executives were largely uninterested in traditional country, but record producer and singer [[Keith Stegall]] gave Clark advice and encouragement to not give up.<ref name=terri/> In 1994, Stegall became an executive at [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]] in Nashville and promptly signed Clark to a record deal.<ref name=terri/>

=== 1995–1997: ''Terri Clark'' and ''Just the Same'' ===
In 1995, Clark issued her first single, "[[Better Things to Do]]." The song managed to reach the top five in both the United States and Canada. Her debut album, ''[[Terri Clark (album)|Terri Clark]],'' followed shortly after. Clark had a hand in writing or co-writing 11 of the album's 12 tracks. ''Terri Clark'' also featured the singles "[[When Boy Meets Girl]]," "[[If I Were You (Terri Clark song)|If I Were You]]," and "[[Suddenly Single]]." "If I Were You" became Clark's first No.&nbsp;1 in Canada in June 1996. The album was certified Gold by the [[RIAA]] in the United States on April 5, 1996, and Platinum on July 29, 1997.

In 1996, Clark's second studio album, ''[[Just the Same]],'' was issued following the album's first single, "Poor Poor Pitiful Me," a cover of the 1976 [[Warren Zevon]] song. The song and its second single, "[[Emotional Girl]]," reached number one in Canada with both songs reaching the top ten in the United States. During late 1996, Clark was awarded Single of the Year for "Better Things to Do" and Album of the Year for ''Terri Clark'' by the [[Canadian Country Music Association]]. By 1997 she would also be awarded the Fans' Choice Award, an award she would win six more times between 2001 and 2007, and Female Artist of the Year, and award she would also claim in 2004 and 2005.

In March 1998, Clark visited [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada to film her first television special, ''Terri Clark: Coming Home'', which premiered March 27 on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada.<ref name=terri2>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1474490/clarks-tv-special-debut.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607015321/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1474490/clarks-tv-special-debut.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 7, 2011|title=Clark's TV Special Debut|access-date=2009-09-06|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> During the special Clark was visited by Canadian country singers [[Paul Brandt]] and [[George Fox (singer)|George Fox]].<ref name=terri2/>

=== 1998–2001: ''How I Feel'' and ''Fearless'' ===
Clark's third studio album, ''[[How I Feel (album)|How I Feel]]'', was issued in May 1998. The album's lead single, "[[Now That I Found You (Terri Clark song)|Now That I Found You]]," reached the top five in both the United States and Canada. It was the album's second single, "[[You're Easy on the Eyes]]," that gave Clark's first American No.&nbsp;1, the song also reached No.&nbsp;1 in Canada. "You're Easy on the Eyes" became a minor Top 40 hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States. To promote the new album, Clark was added as the opening act for [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Brooks & Dunn]] 1998 tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1473630/meet-another-side-of-terri-clark.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607015420/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1473630/meet-another-side-of-terri-clark.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 7, 2011|title=Meet Another Side Of Terri Clark|access-date=2009-09-06|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref>

''[[Fearless (Terri Clark album)|Fearless]]'', Clark's fourth studio album, was issued in September 2000. During the album's production, Clark started writing more personal songs with a new team of co-writers and hired a new producer to deliver a set of songs with a more acoustic feel than that of her previous work.<ref name=terri3>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1472522/gasoline-fuels-fearless.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607015434/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1472522/gasoline-fuels-fearless.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 7, 2011|title="Gasoline" Fuels ''Fearless''|access-date=2009-09-06|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> The album's first single, "[[A Little Gasoline]]", was a late addition to the album because Mercury executives felt Clark needed to balance her new material with something that had a more familiar feel to it.<ref name=terri3/> The song reached the top ten in Canada, however, only reaching No.&nbsp;13 in the United States.

On May 2, 2001, Clark was pulled over by police for speeding in Nashville. The officer, who pulled Clark over, had suspected that she had consumed alcohol and asked her to do sobriety test, after which Clark refused and was charged with a DUI and implied consent.<ref name=terri4>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443589/terri-clark-faces-dui-charges.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607032008/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443589/terri-clark-faces-dui-charges.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 7, 2011|title=Terri Clark Faces DUI Charges|access-date=2009-09-06|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> Clark later apologized for the incident through a statement that was issued to press by her publicist.<ref name=terri4/> In August, Clark pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving and was fined $350 plus court costs, placed on six months' supervised probation and ordered to take an alcohol education course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1446496/terri-clark-pleads-guilty.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607032016/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1446496/terri-clark-pleads-guilty.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 7, 2011|title=Terri Clark Pleads Guilty|access-date=2009-09-06|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref>

=== 2002–2004: ''Pain to Kill'' and ''Greatest Hits 1994-2004'' ===
After a management change in December 2001, Clark began work on her fifth studio album, ''[[Pain to Kill]]''. The album was issued in January 2003, followed after the release of the album's first single, "[[I Just Wanna Be Mad]]". The song, written by Kelley Lovelace and [[Lee Thomas Miller]], was initially intended to be recorded by [[Sara Evans]], who passed on it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1470673/terri-clark-helps-songwriter-turn-mad-to-glad.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607015440/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1470673/terri-clark-helps-songwriter-turn-mad-to-glad.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 7, 2011|title=Terri Clark Helps Songwriter Turn "Mad" to Glad|access-date=2009-09-06|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> When released as a single the song became Clark's highest-charting single in the United States since 1998's "You're Easy on the Eyes" and is to date Clark's highest appearance on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No.&nbsp;27.
