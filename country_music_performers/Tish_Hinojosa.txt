'''Leticia''' ("'''Tish'''") '''Hinojosa''' (born December 6, 1955, [[San Antonio]], Texas) is a [[folk music|folksinger]] recording in both Spanish and English. Hinojosa was the youngest of 13 children. Hinojosa's parents were Mexican immigrants.<ref name=SelfBio_THinojosa/>  Known for singing both traditional Mexican folksongs and her own original songs, both in Spanish and English, Hinojosa accompanies herself on guitar, which she plays right-handed although she is naturally [[Handedness|lefthanded]]. Influenced by traditional [[Music of Mexico|Mexican]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Tejano music|Tejano]], [[conjunto]], and [[Country music|country]] musics, Hinojosa considers her music to be music of the US/Mexico border.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Hinojosa has recorded numerous albums and has charted twice on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/>  Her 1992 album ''Culture Swing'' won the National Association of Independent Record Distributors ([[NAIRD]]) Indie Folk Album of the Year.<ref name=TaosNews2021_THinojosa>{{cite news| publisher=[[Taos News]]| title=Tish Hinojosa remains a Taos favorite| author=Romancito, M.

Using music to bring awareness to cultural issues, Hinojosa hopes to bring into focus the plight of migrant workers and children of the poor. Additionally, she often performs children's music of her culture to help children develop an understanding of the Southwest's Hispanic traditions.<ref name=TARO_THinojosa/>

As of 2021, Hinajosa lives in both [[Austin, Texas]] and [[Tubac, Arizona]].  In the 1970s and 1980s she also lived in [[Taos, New Mexico]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  In 2005, Hinojosa moved to Germany, and in 2013 returned to Austin.<ref name=TaosNews2021_THinojosa/><ref name=TARO_THinojosa/><ref>{{cite news| title=Behind the scenes on the Tish Hinojosa story| last=Flores|first=Nancy| date=September 14, 2014| work=[[The Austin American-Statesman]]| url=https://www.austin360.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/02/03/behind-the-scenes-on-the-tish-hinojosa-story/10193755007/| accessdate=2021-12-18}}</ref>
