'''William Lance Swan''' (born May 12, 1942)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=2427}}</ref> is an American [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter, best known for his 1974 single "[[I Can Help]]".

==Biography ==
Swan was born in [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]], United States.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  As a child, he learned drums, piano and guitar, and began writing songs. His first big break was in 1962 when [[Clyde McPhatter]] recorded "[[Lover Please]]", a song written by Swan when he was in a local band called Mirt Mirly & the Rhythm Steppers, who had first recorded the song on [[Bill Black]]'s Louis label.<ref name="amg">{{cite web|first = Steve | last = Huey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-swan-mn0000768584/biography |title=Billy Swan &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=May 12, 1942 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref> McPhatter's version quickly became a No. 7 [[Billboard Hot 100|pop hit]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Swan moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to work with Black,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> but this was cut short with Black's illness and subsequent death in 1965.  It was rumored that Swan worked as a security guard at [[Graceland]]. While he was friends with one of the security guards he never worked at Graceland. He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which enabled him to write hit [[country music|country]] songs for numerous artists, including [[Conway Twitty]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Mel Tillis]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  In 1969, Swan first took on the role of record producer, producing [[Tony Joe White]]'s [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit "[[Polk Salad Annie]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Swan also played bass guitar for [[Kris Kristofferson]] and then signed a solo recording deal with [[Monument Records]].<ref name="amg"/>

{{quote box|quote="Here's this guy who really doesn't sing very well at all and not only has he now made more good albums than [[Three Dog Night]] and the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] combined, but they keep getting better. Except maybe for '[[Blue Suede Shoes]]' there are no waste cuts this time, and no mediocrities either. The well-meaning optimism and the insecure persona mesh perfectly, and the tunes are pleasurable throughout, whether he stole them from the [[Sun Records|Sun]] catalogue or wrote them himself."|source=—Review of ''Billy Swan'' in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: S|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=S&bk=70|access-date=March 12, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

Swan moved to Nashville in 1973 and cut his first album, ''I Can Help'' in early 1974, which included the track "Lover Please". The album budget was only $19,000, and had been declared, pre-release, by a music business professional hired by the president of Monument Records, Fred Foster, that there were no hits on the record. However, the single "[[I Can Help]]" proved this wrong, recorded at [[Young 'Un Sound]] in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> It was a [[rockabilly]] number that topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well as the US and Canadian country [[record chart|charts]] in 1974, also becoming a hit in many other countries.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Swan wrote the song on an RMI organ that [[Kris Kristofferson|Kristofferson]] and singer [[Rita Coolidge]] had bought for him as a wedding gift.<ref name="LarkinGE" /> However, the RMI organ wasn't used on the final recording, contrary to popular belief, it was actually a portable [[Farfisa]] from [[Bobby Emmons]], a Memphis session musician.<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'">{{Cite web |title=Billy Swan 'I Can Help' |url= https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/billy-swan-can-help |access-date= 2023-03-03 |website= www.soundonsound.com |archive-url=  https://web.archive.org/web/20230303012157/https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/billy-swan-can-help |archive-date= 2023-03-03}}</ref> Swan recalls, "Chip set up a vocal mic, I stood in front of the organ, and what you hear was captured on the second take."<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> The lyrics were written in under twenty minutes.<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> It was recorded in two takes (without [[overdub]]s), and co-produced/engineered by the owner of the recording studio, [[Chip Young]].<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> The label pushed for "The Ways of a Woman in Love" to be the single, but Young insisted the hit was "I Can Help".<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> However, other albums with Monument, [[A&M Records|A&M]], and [[Epic Records|Epic]] did not have nearly the success of "I Can Help".<ref name="amg" />

In 1979, Swan traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place March 2–4, alongside [[Stephen Stills]], the [[CBS Jazz All-Stars]], the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Weather Report]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], [[Mike Finnegan]], Kris Kristofferson, Rita Coolidge, and [[Billy Joel]], plus an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata Güines]], and [[Orquesta Aragón]]. His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary ''Havana Jam '79''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Swan continued to tour as a member of Kristofferson's band and recorded with [[Randy Meisner]] of [[The Eagles]]. In 1986, he entered a California studio (Bench Records) as part of a band called [[Black Tie (band)|Black Tie]] and along with Meisner, Jimmy Griffin ([[Bread (band)|Bread]]), [[David Kemper]] (drummer), David Miner, and David Mansfield recorded an album called ''When the Night Falls''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  He recorded another solo album, ''Like Elvis Used to Do'' in 2000, and another Black Tie-style album with Meisner and Charlie Rich, Jr. billed as "Meisner, Swan & Rich".<ref name="amg"/> {{As of|2005}}, Swan remained a backing singer and [[session musician]].

==Personal life ==
Swan was married to his late wife Marlu for 30 years. Marlu died on February 12, 2003, from cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/102729.html |title=Obituaries: Marlu Swan (02/26/03) |publisher=seMissourian.com |date=February 26, 2003 |access-date=August 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029172951/http://www.semissourian.com/story/102729.html |archive-date=October 29, 2009  }}</ref> They had two daughters, recording artists Planet Swan and [[Sierra Swan]].
