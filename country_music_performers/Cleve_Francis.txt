==Biography==
Francis began his music career as a folk and blues singer and songwriter in the late 1960s while still a graduate student at the [[College of William & Mary]], where he graduated with a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1969.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Eshleman |first=Tina |date=January 2023 |title=Heart & Soul |url=https://alumni.wm.edu/magazine_pdf/2023-winter.pdf |magazine=William & Mary Alumni Magazine |location=[[Williamsburg, Virginia]] |publisher=[[College of William & Mary]] |access-date=January 24, 2023}}</ref> He attended medical school at the Medical College of Virginia (now [[VCU School of Medicine|Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine]]), eventually becoming a [[cardiologist]]. However, in the late 1980s he switched his focus to country music, signing first to Playback Records. His debut country album ''Last Call for Love'' was released that year. The album included a single titled "Love Light", which was also made into a [[music video]].<ref name="des">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/132285874/ | title=Cleve Francis is a country (music) doctor | work=The Des Moines Register | date=April 17, 1992 | accessdate=July 16, 2021 | pages=16T}}</ref>
