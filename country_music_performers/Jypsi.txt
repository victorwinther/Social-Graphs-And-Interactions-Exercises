'''Jypsi''' (pronounced "gypsy") was an American [[country music]] vocal group composed of four siblings, all with the surname Rische: Amber-Dawn ([[fiddle]], [[vocals]]), Frank ([[guitar]], vocals), [[Lillie Mae]] (lead vocals), and Scarlett ([[mandolin]], electric mandolin). Signed to [[Arista Nashville]] in 2007, the group has released three singles, including "I Don't Love You Like That", which reached number 38 on the U.S. country singles charts that year. The band also released its self-titled debut album in May 2008.

Jypsi's self-titled debut album was released in May 2008 as a [[music download]] but not as a physical album. This album includes the song "Now That's All Right with Me," previously released by [[Mandy Barnett]] on her 1996 self-titled debut. ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a favorable review, with reviewer John Lupton saying, "Though it takes a little while to get it going, their self-titled debut demonstrates that there is indeed some substance to the [attractive] image as well."<ref name="cst">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3922|title=''Jypsi'' review|last=Lupton|first=John|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> Lead singer Lillie Mae Rische made a guest appearance on the track "God Knows Who I Am" on [[Montgomery Gentry]]'s 2008 album ''[[Back When I Knew It All]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montgomerygentry.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=1436&inc=7&album_id=1010|title=Back When I Knew It All|work=Montgomery Gentry|accessdate=2009-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816215650/http://montgomerygentry.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=1436&inc=7&album_id=1010|archive-date=2009-08-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The group's third single, "Mister Officer," was released in August 2009. It was also made into the band's first [[music video]], directed by [[Roman White]]. Bobby Peacock of Roughstock.com said "Lillie Mae Rische's vocals gives a youthful, energetic performance that helps sell the song."<ref name="Roughstock">{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/jypsi-mister-officer-|title=Jypsi - "Mister Officer" Roughtstock review|publisher=Roughstock|author=Bobby Peacock|date=2009-09-10|accessdate=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101203442/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/jypsi-mister-officer-|archive-date=2011-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Juli Thanki of Engine 145 gave it a thumbs-up, saying "Despite its shortcomings—and there are a few—'Mr. Officer' is bursting at the seams with carefree, youthful exuberance and bright three-part harmony."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engine145.com/jypsi-mr-officer/|title=Jypsi — "Mr. Officer"|last=Thanki|first=Juli|date=2009-08-05|work=Engine 145|accessdate=2009-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218103744/http://www.engine145.com/jypsi-mr-officer/|archive-date=2014-12-18|url-status=dead}}</ref> "Mister Officer" peaked at 52.

After Jypsi broke up, Lillie Mae Rische began recording as a solo artist under the name [[Lillie Mae]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/who-is-lillie-mae/|title=Who Is Lillie Mae? 5 Things You Need to Know|first=Riane|last=Konc|website=Theboot.com|date=21 March 2018 |accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>
