Following it were two additional singles, "Louisiana Love", and "Let's Get It On". "Louisiana Love" failed to chart, and "Let's Get It On" reached No.&nbsp;57. However, those songs were never included on an album. Then in 2006, the group released "Get Outta My Way". Co-written by [[Robert Ellis Orrall]] and [[Curtis Wright]], this song became their first Top 40 country hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;28. After its release came their debut album ''[[Weather the Storm]]'',<ref name="allmusic"/> which also included "I Ain't Scared". After "Get Outta My Way" came their highest-charting single in the No.&nbsp;26 "Isn't She",<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book | title=Joel Whitburn's Top Country singles 1944-2017 | author=Joel Whitburn | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | year=2017 | pages=71 | isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref> followed by the non-charting "Dealin'".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/278340934/ | title=5 questions with Carolina Rain | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=September 13, 2007 | accessdate=January 26, 2018 | author=Heather Byrd | pages=17}}</ref>

===''American Radio''===
In late 2008, the group released a new single titled "American Radio". The single intended to be the lead-off to a second studio album of the same name. The song reached No.&nbsp;53 on the country charts a few weeks after its release. A second single from the album, "Weight of the World" was released, but Equity closed in December 2008.
