'''David Lynn Jones''' (born January 15, 1950) is an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter. Between 1987 and 1994, Jones released four studio albums. He also charted four singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart. His highest charting single, "[[Bonnie Jean (Little Sister)]]," peaked at number ten in 1987.

==Biography==
David Lynn Jones was born January 15, 1950, in [[Bexar, Arkansas]]. In the 1970s, he played bass in a local band called Freddy Morrison & the Bandana Blues, and had a minor songwriting success with [[Randy Cornor]]'s hit "Heart Don't Fail Me Now".<ref name="allmusic"/> By 1986, Jones had also written "[[Living in the Promiseland]]", a No.&nbsp;1 single on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts for [[Willie Nelson]]. He also recorded the song's demo and played all but one instrument on it.<ref name="allmusic"/> Nelson also recorded another one of Jones's songs, "When Times Were Good", with [[Merle Haggard]] on their 1987 duet album ''Seashores of Old Mexico''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outlawmagazine.com/2013/09/19/a-conversation-with-david-lynn-jones/|title=A Conversation With David Lynn Jones|date=March 19, 2013|work=Outlaw Magazine|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref>

[[Mercury Records]] signed Jones in 1987 and released his debut album ''[[Hard Times on Easy Street]]'' that year. The album included ten tracks, all written by Jones. Lead single "[[Bonnie Jean (Little Sister)]]" charted at No.&nbsp;10 on Hot Country Songs. Three more singles made the charts: "High Ridin' Heroes" (a duet with [[Waylon Jennings]]), "The Rogue", and "Tonight in America".<ref name="whitburn"/> Jones wrote all ten of the songs on the album, including his own rendition of "Living in the Promiseland", and co-produced it with Richie Albright and [[Mick Ronson]].<ref name="liner">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Hard Times on Easy Street |others=David Lynn Jones |year=1987 |type=LP jacket |publisher=Mercury Records |id=832 518 1}}</ref>

A second album, ''Wood, Wind and Stone'', followed in 1990. This album featured a more pop music oriented sound than its predecessor.<ref name="allmusic"/> He also recorded two albums for [[Liberty Records]]: ''Mixed Emotions'' in 1992 and ''Play by Ear'' two years later.<ref name="allmusic"/> By the end of the decade, he worked as a writer for Blue Water Music, in addition to running a recording studio in Bexar.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Jones was the victim of a case of [[identity theft]] in the early 2000s, which made releasing additional albums difficult for fear that any royalty checks would be stolen by the perpetrators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gypsyscholarship.blogspot.com/2009/03/david-lynn-jones-real-one.html|title=David Lynn Jones . . . the real one|date=March 21, 2009|work=Batesville Daily Guard |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref> In 2017 Jones won a $2.1&nbsp;million judgment against a local bank after the jury found that the bank had sold the master tapes to over 100 of his songs and recording equipment "without permission or cause" at a public auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ozarkradionews.com/local-news/musician-wins-2-million-judgement-against-local-bank|title=Musician wins $2 million judgement against local bank|date=April 4, 2017|work=Ozark Radio News|accessdate=December 12, 2017|archive-date=April 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413185734/https://www.ozarkradionews.com/local-news/musician-wins-2-million-judgement-against-local-bank|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Musical styles and reception==
Jones cited [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as his main musical influences. A 1989 article in ''[[Cash Box]]'' stated that his first album "told stories of his life on the road, stories about his family, and about learning some of life’s lessons."<ref name="cash">{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=Kay|date=October 21, 1989|title=David Lynn Jones: The new generation|journal=[[Cash Box]]|page=24|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/80s/1989/CB-1989-10-21.pdf}}</ref> "Bonnie Jean" was written about Jones's sister, a truck driver,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fell|first=Ron|date=September 11, 1987|title=Bio Feedback|journal=Gavin Report|page=26|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Gavin-Report/80/87/Gavin-1987-09-11.pdf}}</ref> and the single "High Ridin' Heroes" was about a rodeo rider that Jones knew.<ref name="cash"/>

Thom Owens of [[Allmusic]] wrote that ''Hard Times on Easy Street'' "showcases a talent that arrived fully formed. Though Jones doesn't push any musical boundaries, his ear for straight-forwards, rock-inflected rootsy country is impeccable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hard-times-on-easy-street-mw0000196900|title=''Hard Times on Easy Street'' review|last=Owens|first=Thom|work=Allmusic|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> ''Cash Box'' also praised ''Mixed Emotions'', with an uncredited review stating that it "offers a kaleidoscope of meaning in each cut".<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 28, 1992|title=Album review|journal=Cash Box|page=19|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/90s/1992/CB-1992-03-28.pdf}}</ref>
