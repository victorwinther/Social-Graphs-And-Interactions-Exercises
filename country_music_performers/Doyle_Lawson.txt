==Early life==

Doyle Lawson was born in Fordtown, [[Sullivan County, Tennessee]],<ref name="McNeil2013">{{cite book|author=W. K. McNeil|title=Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beGNAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA226|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-37700-7|pages=226–}}</ref> the son of Leonard and Minnie Lawson. The Lawson family moved to [[Sneedville]] in 1954.<ref name="Ledgin2004">{{cite book|author=Stephanie P.

This is where he heard mandolinist [[Bill Monroe]], the "founding father" of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and his band ''the Blue Grass Boys''.

Lawson became interested in playing the mandolin around the age of eleven so his father borrowed a mandolin from Willis Byrd, a family friend and fellow musician. Doyle taught himself how to play the mandolin by listening to the radio and records, and watching an occasional TV show.<ref name=aj /> Later Lawson learned to play the [[guitar]] and [[banjo]] as well.<ref name="McNeil2013" />

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1963, aged 18 or 19, Lawson went to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to play the banjo with [[Jimmy Martin|Jimmy Martin and the Sunny Mountain Boys]].<ref name="WolffDuane2000">{{cite book|author1=Kurt Wolff|author2=Orla Duane|title=Country Music: The Rough Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&pg=PA228|year=2000|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-534-4|pages=228–}}</ref>

In 1966, he started playing with [[J.D. Crowe]] and the Kentucky Mountain Boys (later called the [[New South (band)|New South]]) in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. He returned to play the mandolin and sing tenor with Martin in 1969 for six months, and then played again with Crowe until August 1971.<ref name="Ledgin2004" /><ref name=cont>{{cite book|title=Contemporary Musicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwo5AQAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Gale Research, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7876-8068-8|pages=101–102}}</ref>

In September, 1971, Lawson started playing with [[The Country Gentlemen]] and remained part of the band for almost eight years. During that time, in 1977, he backed up U.S. Senator [[Robert Byrd]] on his ''Mountain Fiddler'' album. In  March 1979, Lawson left the Country Gentlemen with the intention of forming a band and creating his own sound.<ref name="Ledgin2004" /><ref name="McNeil2013"/>

===Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver===
Within a month Lawson had formed ''Doyle Lawson and Foxfire'', with Jimmy Haley on guitar, [[Lou Reid]] on bass, and [[Terry Baucom]] on banjo.<ref name="McNeil2013"/>  The band name was soon changed to ''Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver''.<ref name="Goldsmith2004">{{cite book|author=Thomas Goldsmith|title=The Bluegrass Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgAGzopOTbYC&pg=PA248|year=2004|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02914-1|pages=248–}}</ref><ref>"No one since the late great Bill Monroe melds bluegrass with gospel music quite like the former Country Gentlemen member Doyle Lawson…" [[Memphis Commercial Appeal]] (what date?).</ref> In 1981, through [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]], Lawson with this lineup released the critically acclaimed ''Rock My Soul'', an album that would become a landmark bluegrass gospel project.<ref name="WolffDuane2000" /><ref name="Rosenberg2005">{{cite book|author=Neil V.

Shortly thereafter, Graham, Baucom and Haley left to form their own band.  Lawson hired guitarist [[Russell Moore and IIIrd Tyme Out|Russell Moore]], banjoist [[Scott Vestal]] and bassist Curtis Vestal, and continued to perform.  After a time Ray Deaton took over on bass.<ref name="McNeil2013"/>

In 1989 the band won song of the year at the [[International Bluegrass Music Awards]] for "Little Mountain Church House". In 1997, ''There's a Light Guiding Me'' was a 39th Annual Grammy Award nominee for Best Southern Gospel, Country Gospel or Bluegrass Gospel Album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-01-08-ca-16471-story.html|title=The Complete List of Nominees|date=1997-01-08|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref> Through the years, Quicksilver toured regularly, performing at festivals concerts and other musical events.<ref>{{cite book|title=No Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=025LAAAAYAAJ|year=2004|publisher=No Depression|pages=22, issues 49–54}}</ref>

In 1998, Lawson and Quicksilver became the first bluegrass band to perform at the [[National Quartet Convention]]. Lawson and Quicksilver performed in [[Ontario]], Canada at the [[Tottenham Bluegrass Festival]] in June 2001<ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, May/June 2001</ref> and again in June 2015.

In 2015, ''In Session'' was nominated for Best Bluegrass Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/awards/58th-annual-grammy-awards?cat=611 |title=58th Annual Grammy Awards |publisher=[[Grammy Awards]] |access-date=2024-06-14}}</ref>

Lawson composed a number of the band's songs and tunes. His instrumental piece "Rosine", is a tribute to [[Rosine, Kentucky|Monroe's birthplace]] and features, among other things, strains from the singer's 1967 instrumental "Kentucky Mandolin".<ref>[http://ibmaawards.org/node/43#2012 Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203195413/http://ibmaawards.org/node/43#2012 |date=December 3, 2012}}, ibmaawards.org; accessed October 30, 2015.</ref> Lawson hosts the annual Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver Festival in [[Denton, North Carolina]].
