'''Heartland''' is an American [[country music]] band from [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. It originally consisted of Jason Albert (lead vocals), Craig Anderson (rhythm guitar), Todd Anderson (drums), Chuck Crawford (fiddle, background vocals), Mike Myerson (lead guitar), and Keith West (bass guitar, background vocals). Signed to [[Lofton Creek Records]] in 2006, the band topped the country charts that year with its debut single "[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]", also the title track to its debut album. After their next five singles failed to chart within the Top 40, all members except Albert and Crawford left, with former solo artist Chad Austin joining. This lineup disbanded in 2012. In 2023, the band re-established with a lineup consisting of Craig and Todd Anderson, Mike Myerson, and lead vocalist Lance Horton.

==History==
Heartland was founded in 1994 by Jason Albert, brothers Craig and Todd Anderson, and Mike Myerson. They performed at a June Jam in the state of Alabama in 1997, and began seeking a record contract through the assistance of songwriter [[Walt Aldridge]].<ref name="cmt"/>

Heartland signed with an [[independent record label]] called [[Lofton Creek Records]] in 2006. The group's debut single, "[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]", was released later that year, and went on to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1545692/heartland-scores-a-no-1-its-first-time-out.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031002016/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1545692/heartland-scores-a-no-1-its-first-time-out.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 31, 2013|title=Heartland Scores a No. 1 Its First Time Out |accessdate=2008-02-07 |last=Morris |first=Edward |date=2006-11-13 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT.com]]}}</ref> The band's debut album, also titled ''[[I Loved Her First]]'', was released in October 2006. Ken Burke of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a positive review, praising the instrumentation and Albert's "hardcore southern vocals", also saying that it had "snappy execution and catchy hooks galore."<ref name="cst">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3366|title=Heartland - ''I Loved Her First''|last=Burke|first=Ken|work=[[Country Standard Time]]|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

After its second and third singles performed poorly, the band exited Lofton Creek and signed with Country Thunder Records in March 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/genre/e3i16a9e623559cc9c817f7a064b20052da|title=Heartland Exits Label|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=March 26, 2007|work=[[Billboard.biz]]|accessdate=14 September 2012|archive-date=29 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120344/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/genre/e3i16a9e623559cc9c817f7a064b20052da|url-status=dead}}</ref> They began working with producer [[Mark Bright (record producer)|Mark Bright]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.com/heartland/bio/heartland_bio.pdf|title=Heartland|work=WMA.com|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> but instead released "Once a Woman Gets a Hold of Your Heart", which was co-written by [[John Rich]] of [[Big & Rich]] and [[Richie McDonald]] of [[Lonestar]], with Rich also serving as producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=838|title=Heartland hopes for repeat success|work=[[Country Standard Time]]|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> It was followed by "Slow Down", which did not chart.

By 2012, all of the original members except Albert and Crawford had left the band to start families, while Chad Austin joined. Austin had recorded two albums for [[Asylum Records]] in the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chad-austin-mn0001262601|title=Chad Austin biography|last=Johnson|first=Zac|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> and was later signed to [[Broken Bow Records]]. Also, Albert had been experiencing vocal issues which had to be treated with exercises and rest. To reduce the strain on his vocal cords, all three members now alternate on lead vocals.<ref name="weekly"/> The lineup of Albert, Crawford, and Austin released a new single, "The Sound a Dream Makes", in September 2012. It was produced by [[James Stroud]]<ref name="weekly">{{cite journal|last=Stark|first=Phyllis|date=September 24, 2012|title=Overnight Success|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=19|issue=39|pages=48–49|issn=1074-3235}}</ref> and released via his [[R&J Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heartlandband.com/cpt_news/rj-records-to-release-groups-new-single-to-country-radio-on-monday-october-1/|title=R&J Records to Release Group's New Single to Country Radio on Monday, October 1|date=17 September 2012|work=Heartland|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref>

In July 2019, the band (now consisting of Jason Albert, Charles Crawford and Keith West) released its first album in over a decade titled ''I Loved Her First: The Heart of Heartland'' on [[Permian Records]], featuring 10 new original songs with special guest appearances by [[Tracy Lawrence]] on the new version of their first hit "[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]" and [[Samantha Crawford]] on "When Love Comes Around".

In 2023, the Anderson brothers and Mike Myerson re-established Heartland with a new lead singer, Lance Horton. The band also announced a new album slated for release later in the year via Yellowhammer Records.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://musicrow.com/2023/04/heartland-to-return-with-new-album/ | title=Heartland To Return With New Album | publisher=MusicRow | date=April 6, 2023 | accessdate=April 6, 2023}}</ref>
