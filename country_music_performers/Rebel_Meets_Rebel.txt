'''''Rebel Meets Rebel''''' is a [[country rock|country metal]] album by [[David Allan Coe]] and [[Pantera]] members [[Dimebag Darrell]], [[Rex Brown]], and [[Vinnie Paul]].<ref name=Leroy>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/coe-revisits-penitentiary-20050714 |title=Coe Revisits Penitentiary |author=Dan Leroy |date=July 14, 2005 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref> The music was written and recorded by the band when the musicians had time aside from their other projects, including Pantera's world tour supporting ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]''.

The album was released on May 2, 2006, under Vinnie Paul's own label [[Big Vin Records]], posthumously after [[Columbus nightclub shooting|Darrell's murder]] in December 2004.

==Background==
At the close of the decade, Coe met Pantera guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The two musicians, struck by the similarity of the approaches between [[Country music|country]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], agreed to work together. Darrell was the son of [[Jerry Abbott]], a country songwriter and producer. Together with Darrell's brother [[Vinnie Paul]] and bassist [[Rex Brown]], they began production of the album which was recorded sporadically between 1999 and 2003. It was released in 2006, two years after Darrell's murder.<ref name="Legett">{{cite web|author=Steve Leggett|title=Rebel Meets Rebel|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rebel-meets-rebel-p771849/biography|access-date=August 21, 2011|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

Originally, the song "Rebel Meets Rebel" was supposed to be released as a duet with Coe and Pantera's vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451613/20011226/pantera.jhtml?headlines=true | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020210000533/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451613/20011226/pantera.jhtml?headlines=true | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2002 | title=Pantera Members Rip It Up With Rebellious Side Projects|publisher=[[MTV]] | date=December 21, 2001 | first=Jon | last=Wiederhorn | access-date = November 4, 2006}}</ref>

==Music and lyrics==
The album's lyrical content ranges from boisterous songs regarding drinking and getting stoned to more serious subject matter, such as the song "Cherokee Cry", which criticizes the United States government's treatment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref name=Frye/>

''Rebel Meets Rebel'' features what has been described as a "groundbreaking" mix of [[country music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name=Frye/> [[AllMusic]] writer Megan Frye wrote, "On first listen, ["Nothin' to Lose"] sounds awkward—as if someone had spliced a Pantera song together with a David Allan Coe one on their home computer. It doesn't mesh well, and the bass seems too sharp and tinny. But after listening to the album a few times, it starts to make more sense."<ref name=Frye/> [[Dimebag Darrell]] was praised for his guitar playing, which incorporated elements from [[thrash metal]], as well as dark melodic playing.<ref name=Frye/> "Rebel Meets Rebel" features fiddle playing by Joey Floyd.<ref name=Frye/>
