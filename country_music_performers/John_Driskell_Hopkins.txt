They decided to join forces and record a CD. In September 2012, the album ''Daylight'' was completed, and officially released January 2013.
{{blockquote|If you drew line graphs plotting the changes each song brings to a CD – tempo, subject, mood … – some CDs would flatline and the majority would show moderate spikes up and down. Daylight's graph would look like the EKG of a person on speed, and every song is a good one. I hope Hopkins is already planning his next CD.<ref>Larry Stephens, ''The lonesome Road Review''</ref>}}

Balsam Range is a five-piece bluegrass powerhouse from [[Haywood County, North Carolina]], and include members Buddy Melton (fiddle, vocals), Darren Nicholson (mandolin, vocals), Marc Pruett (banjo), Caleb Smith (guitar, vocals), and Tim Surrett (bass, dobro, vocals).
