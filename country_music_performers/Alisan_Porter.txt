As a child, Porter made acting appearances in ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'', ''[[Stella (1990 film)|Stella]]'' and ''[[I Love You to Death]]''. Her breakout role came in 1991, when she played the lead in the film ''[[Curly Sue]]'' opposite [[Jim Belushi]].

As an adult, Porter pursued roles in musical theatre, including a run in ''[[The Ten Commandments: The Musical]]'' and as an original cast member of the Broadway revival of ''[[A Chorus Line]]''. A solo album followed in 2009. In 2016, she auditioned for the [[The Voice (American TV series) season 10|tenth season]] of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'', earning a spot on Team [[Christina Aguilera|Christina]]. In May of that same year, Porter was named the winner of the show.

==Life and career==
Born to [[American Jews|Jewish]] parents in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], Porter is the great-granddaughter of prominent Worcester rabbi [[Temple Emanuel Sinai (Worcester, Massachusetts)#Temple Emanuel history|Joseph Klein]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gold|first=Sylviane|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/On+the+rise:+Alisan+Porter+born+to+play+Chorus+Line's+Bebe-a0152433195|title=On the rise: Alisan Porter born to play Chorus Line's Bebe|work=[[Dance Magazine]]|via=[[The Free Library]]|date=October 1, 2006|access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Her grandmother ran the Charlotte Klein Dance Center.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duckett|first=Richard|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20060608/news/606080450|title=Following in mother's dance-steps|work=[[Telegram & Gazette]]|location=[[Worcester, Massachusetts]]|date=June 8, 2006|access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Porter's father, Ric Porter, was co-founder, lead singer, and songwriter of the Worcester-based band Zonkaraz.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Dianne|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20130530/COLUMN01/105309875?_ga=1.24358073.2067001835.1465261530|title=Zonkaraz still feels the love|work=[[Telegram & Gazette]]|location=[[Worcester, Massachusetts]]|date=June 5, 2016|access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Her mother, Laura Klein, also taught dance, coaching [[Klimaszewski Twins|Diane and Elaine Klimaszewski]], who appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'' in 1987 in the junior dance category before they became known as the Coors Light Twins. While in Los Angeles for the twins' appearance on ''Star Search'', the show's producer heard Porter singing in the hotel lobby and booked her to appear on the next episode. Porter has been singing and performing since age three; at age five, she became the youngest ''Star Search'' participant ever to win the competition. That same year, she also appeared on [[Pee Wee's Playhouse]] as one of the playhouse gang in Season 2.

Porter acted in several films as a child; she became known for playing the title role in the 1991 movie ''[[Curly Sue]]'' opposite [[Jim Belushi]]. On television, she played the youngest daughter of [[Lynn Redgrave]] on the short-lived ABC sitcom ''[[Chicken Soup (TV series)|Chicken Soup]]'' in 1989. The following year, she was slated to be a new regular cast member on ''[[Perfect Strangers (TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'', but her character was dropped after only one episode.

Porter continued acting at Staples High School in [[Westport, Connecticut]], where she joined a theater group and participated in various shows. While a freshman, Porter portrayed Anita in ''[[West Side Story]]'', and as a senior played the lead in ''Cinderella''. After Porter won ''The Voice'' in 2016, her former high school drama teacher said she was not surprised by the result. "She blew everybody away" with her performance in ''West Side Story'', and "really seemed to get the best out of everybody else. Her energy rubbed off on everybody. She inspired others."<ref name="QCOnline">{{cite web|url=http://www.qconline.com/news/local/retired-moline-teacher-recalls-the-voice-winner/article_c30de1c7-5198-5c87-a9d1-2b6741ec5617.html|title=Retired Moline teacher recalls ''The Voice'' winner|work=[[The Dispatch / The Rock Island Argus]]|via=QCOnline|location=[[Moline, Illinois]]|date=May 25, 2016|access-date=May 26, 2016|last=Turner|first=Jonathan}}</ref>

In 2003, the band The Raz was formed, with Porter as the vocalist and main songwriter. The Raz split up in 2004. In March 2005, she announced the birth of her new band, The Alisan Porter Project. During 2006, she performed in the revival of ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' as Bebe Benzenheimer at the [[Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre]] in [[New York City]].
