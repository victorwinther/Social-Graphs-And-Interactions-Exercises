'''Kolby Cooper''' (born May 31, 1999) is an American [[country music]] singer. Active since 2019, he has released two [[extended play]]s and charted one single through Combustion Music.

==Biography==
Kolby Cooper was born in [[Bradford, Texas]]. He grew up listening to both [[outlaw country]] and [[grunge]], both of which inspired him to learn to play guitar and write songs. Although he initially wanted to be a football player, a high school classmate persuaded him to focus on music instead.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/08/19/kolby-cooper-boy-anderson-county-moon-talks-new-album/10284329002/ | title=Kolby Cooper rides a country music silver lining 'From Anderson County to the Moon' | publisher=The Tennessean | date=August 19, 2022 | accessdate=April 10, 2023}}</ref>

By the time he finished high school, Cooper was married and had begun writing songs full-time. After entering some of his songs in local talent competitions, he released his debut single "Every Single Kiss" in 2017 followed by an [[extended play]] a year later. He continued to release songs through Combustion Music throughout the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kolby-cooper-mn0003961524/biography | title=Kolby Cooper biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 10, 2023}}</ref>

By 2022, Cooper was signed to [[BBR Music Group]]'s Wheelhouse imprint, which sent the single "Excuses" to radio late in the year. He wrote the song with Brett Tyler and Jordan Walker.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://tasteofcountry.com/kolby-cooper-excuses/ | title=Kolby Cooper, 'Excuses' Explores the Frayed Emotions of a Breakup | publisher=Taste of Country | date=December 13, 2022 | accessdate=April 10, 2023}}</ref> It served as the lead single to Cooper's debut album, ''Boy from Anderson County to the Moon'', which was released on August 19, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/08/19/kolby-cooper-boy-anderson-county-moon-talks-new-album/10284329002/|title=Kolby Cooper rides a country music silver lining 'From Anderson County to the Moon'|author=Marcus K.
