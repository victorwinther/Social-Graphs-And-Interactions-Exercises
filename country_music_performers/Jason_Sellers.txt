'''Jason Dale Sellers''' (born March 4, 1971) is an American [[country music]] artist. After several years of touring the United States in his family's band, Sellers joined the road band of [[Ricky Skaggs]]. By 1997, he was signed to a recording contract with [[BNA Records]], for whom he recorded two studio albums: 1997's ''[[I'm Your Man (Jason Sellers album)|I'm Your Man]]'' and 1999's ''[[A Matter of Time (Jason Sellers album)|A Matter of Time]]''. These two albums produced five singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts; each album's title track reached Top 40 on that chart. Although he has not recorded any albums since ''A Matter of Time'', Jason has had continued success as a songwriter, with acts such as [[Lonestar]], [[Kenny Chesney]], and [[Montgomery Gentry]] having recorded his songs. In addition, he holds several credits as a session background vocalist.
