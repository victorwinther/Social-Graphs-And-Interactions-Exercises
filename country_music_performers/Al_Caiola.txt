==Early life==
Alexander Emil Caiola was born in [[Jersey City]], New Jersey to Emil Caiola and Genevieve Esposito. His father was employed as a barber.<ref name=Roberts2016/>

At a young age, Caiola first expressed an interest in a musical career solely as a vocalist. He was soon persuaded by his father to also pursue professional opportunities as an instrumentalist instead. This led Caiola to take up the banjo and subsequently the guitar.<ref name="Carlton2009">{{cite book |title=Conversations with Great Jazz and Studio Guitarists |first=Jim |last=Carlton |chapter=Al Caiola |year=2009 |publisher=[[Mel Bay Publications]] |pages=5–18 |isbn=978-0786651238}}</ref><ref name=Roberts2016/>

By the age of 11, he emerged as a child prodigy on the guitar and undertook formal studies with Anthony Antone in New York City and subsequently with the guitarist Peter Milano in Jersey City. As a young teenager, he was influenced by the performances of [[Eddie Lang]] and [[Bing Crosby]] and studied Lang's method book for guitarists closely. By the age of sixteen he appeared as both a vocalist and guitarist on the children's radio program ''Sally and Sam'' in collaboration with [[Tony Mottola]]. During this time Mottola encouraged Caiola to master new performance techniques.<ref name="Carlton2009"/><ref name=Roberts2016/>

After returning from military service during World War II, Caiola pursued formal musical studies at the New Jersey College of Music. Over the years, he also completed studies with the guitarist [[Harry Volpe]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Bay | first=William | title=Masters of the Plectrum Guitar | publisher=Mel Bay Publications | date=2010-10-07 | isbn=978-1-60974-029-0 | url={{Google books | vK96j6JlMbgC | page=4 | plainurl=yes}} | page=4}}</ref><ref name="Carlton2009"/>
