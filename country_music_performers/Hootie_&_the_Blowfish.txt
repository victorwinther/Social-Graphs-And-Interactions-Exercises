'''Hootie & the Blowfish''' is an American rock band formed in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in 1986. The band's lineup for most of its existence has been the quartet of [[Darius Rucker]], [[Mark Bryan]], Dean Felber, and Jim Sonefeld. The band went on hiatus in 2008 until they announced plans for a full reunion tour in 2019 and released their first new studio album in fourteen years, ''[[Imperfect Circle]]''.

{{As of|2019}}, Hootie & the Blowfish have won two Grammy Awards, landed sixteen singles on various ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' singles charts, and released six studio albums.

The band is known for its three Top 10 singles: "[[Hold My Hand (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Hold My Hand]]" (1994), "[[Let Her Cry (song)|Let Her Cry]]" (1994), and "[[Only Wanna Be with You]]" (1995).

==History==
===Early years===
[[Darius Rucker]] and [[Mark Bryan]] met in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in the mid-1980s when they were both freshmen at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name="RollingStone2005">Bashe, P. R., & George-Warren, H., ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Third ed.). New York, Fireside, 2005, p. 443</ref> Bryan, a guitar player, heard Rucker singing in the showers of the dorm they shared and was impressed by his vocal ability. The pair began playing [[cover version|cover]] tunes as the Wolf Brothers.

Eventually, they collaborated with bassist Dean Felber, a former high school bandmate of Bryan's, and Brantley Smith, a drummer. In 1986, they adopted the name Hootie & the Blowfish, a conjunction of the nicknames of two of their college friends.<ref name="hoot_Hoot">{{Cite web |title=Hootie & the Blowfish |url=http://www.hootie.com/about/ |access-date=January 1, 2015 |website=hootie.com |quote=The unlikely moniker was borrowed from the nicknames of two college friends.}}</ref> The band is routinely featured in articles and polls about badly-named bands.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 January 2012 |title=The Worst Band Names Ever - NME |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-worst-band-names-ever-780296 |website=Nme.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Gelfand |first=Michael |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GC_HDgAAQBAJ&q=hootie+&pg=PT92 |title=Strategies for Success: Self-Promotion Secrets for Musicians |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=Schirmer Trade Books |isbn=9780857121974 |via=Google Books}}</ref> Rucker is often labeled as being the "Hootie" in the band's name.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rock On The Net: Hootie & The Blowfish / Darius Rucker |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-h/hootieandtheblowfish_main.htm |access-date=December 8, 2019 |website=Rockonthenet.com}}</ref> Smith left the group after finishing college to pursue music ministry, but he has made scattered guest appearances with the band (he played cello on their ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' performance in 1996 and played drums at Gruene Hall in [[Gruene, Texas]], on June 27, 2008). Smith was replaced full time in 1989 by Jim "Soni" Sonefeld. The band's lineup has remained the same ever since.

The band independently released two cassette demo [[Extended play|EP]]s in 1991 and 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} In 1993, they pressed 50,000 copies of a self-released EP, ''[[Kootchypop]]''. They were signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in August 1993 after being discovered by Atlantic [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative [[Tim Sommer]], a former music journalist and member of the art rock band [[Hugo Largo]].<ref name="sommer">{{Cite web |last=Sommer |first=Tim |date=14 July 2016 |title=My Life in the Bush of Hootie: How I Signed the Biggest Band of 1995 |url=http://observer.com/2016/07/my-life-in-the-bush-of-hootie-how-i-signed-the-biggest-band-of-1995/ |access-date=16 July 2016 |website=Observer}}</ref> Sommer recalled that other record labels were uninterested in signing Hootie & The Blowfish because their sound was radically different from the [[grunge]] music that was popular at the time.<ref name="sommer" />

===1994–1995: ''Cracked Rear View'' and mainstream success===
Their mainstream debut album was ''[[Cracked Rear View]]'' (1994). Released in July 1994, the album's popularity grew after its release, becoming the best-selling album of 1995, and was one of the fastest-selling debut albums of all time. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the United States in January 1995, and incrementally rose to 12× platinum by January 1996, and 16× platinum by March 1999. In May 2019, the certification was updated from 16× platinum to 21× platinum.

The album featured four hits, "[[Hold My Hand (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Hold My Hand]]" (U.S. No. 10), "[[Let Her Cry (song)|Let Her Cry]]" (U.S. No. 9), "[[Only Wanna Be with You]]" (U.S. No.&nbsp;6), and "[[Time (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Time]]" (U.S. No. 14).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{Cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Rock Discography |publisher=Mojo Books |year=2000 |isbn=1-84195-017-3 |edition=5th |location=Edinburgh |page=459}}</ref> The album's last single, "[[Drowning (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Drowning]]", was not as successful as its predecessors, peaking only on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart.

===1996–1997: ''Fairweather Johnson'' and promotional singles===
In 1995, Hootie & the Blowfish contributed the song "[[Hey, Hey, What Can I Do]]" to the ''[[Encomium (album)|Encomium]]'' tribute album to [[Led Zeppelin]]. Their [[cover version|cover]] of Canadian group [[54-40 (band)|54-40]]'s "[[I Go Blind]]", released on the soundtrack to the television series ''[[Friends]]'' in 1995, did not appear on ''Cracked Rear View'' or ''Fairweather Johnson'', but became a hit on radio in 1996 after three singles from ''Fairweather Johnson'' had been released. Both "Hey, Hey, What Can I Do" and "I Go Blind" were later released on the compilation ''Scattered, Smothered and Covered''.

On February 28, 1996, at the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards]], Hootie & the Blowfish won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (for the single "Let Her Cry") and the Grammy for "Best New Artist".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/hootie-blowfish/16330|title=Hootie & the Blowfish |website=Grammy.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9602/grammy_pm/|title=CNN - Morrissette, Hootie big Grammy winners |website=www.cnn.com |date=February 29, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/darius-rucker-my-grammy-moment-5885248/|title=Darius Rucker: My GRAMMY Moment|website=Billboard.com |date=January 24, 2014}}</ref> The band appeared on ''MTV Unplugged'' on the eve of the release of their second album, ''[[Fairweather Johnson]]'' (1996).

The group covered the 1968 Orpheus hit "Can't Find the Time" for the [[soundtrack]] of the [[Jim Carrey]] movie ''[[Me, Myself & Irene]]'' (2000). The song's writer, Bruce Arnold, traded verses with Darius on several occasions when the band played live on the West Coast. The band kept to an extensive touring schedule, including an annual New Year's Eve show at [[Silverton Las Vegas]] (formerly known as Boomtown Las Vegas) in [[Enterprise, Nevada]].

The band released a [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and rarities [[compilation album|compilation]] titled ''[[Scattered, Smothered and Covered]]'' (2000). This album is named in tribute of [[Waffle House]], a popular Southern chain of all-night diners.

In 1996, Hootie & the Blowfish started their own record label, Breaking Records, as a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. They had planned to focus on signing local Carolina acts.

[[The Meat Puppets]], [[Jump, Little Children]], Virginwool, Treadmill Trackstar, and Treehouse released one album each on Breaking Records. The label folded in 2000.

===Charity work===
[[Tim Sommer]], the band's A&R representative at Atlantic Records, said Hootie & The Blowfish donated all the proceeds from a Seattle concert in the 1990s to a rape crisis group that had been set up in memory of [[Mia Zapata]], the lead singer of the punk band [[The Gits]], who had been murdered in 1993. Sommer had originally intended to sign The Gits to Atlantic before Zapata's death and prior to him signing Hootie & The Blowfish.<ref name="sommer" />
