Eventually, Logan was signed to [[Curb Records]], releasing his debut single "I Made You a Woman for Somebody Else", which was withdrawn when [[Conway Twitty]] recorded it.<ref name="oldies"/> By 1988, Logan had released his first album ''Somebody Paints the Wall''. This album produced three chart singles, the highest-charting being "Every Time I Get to Dreamin'", which spent nine weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts and peaked at No.&nbsp;58.<ref name="allmusic"/> Both it and its follow-up, "Somebody Paints the Wall", reached Top 40 on the ''[[Cash Box]]'' country charts as well.<ref name="baby"/> The latter song was also a Top 10 for [[Tracy Lawrence]] in 1992.

The album's success led to tours with [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Earl Thomas Conley]]. The third and final single, "I Was Born with a Broken Heart", was co-written by [[Aaron Tippin]], whose own version was later released as a single from his 1992 album ''[[Read Between the Lines (Aaron Tippin album)|Read Between the Lines]]''. [[David Ball (country singer)|David Ball]] also recorded the song on his 1989 [[David Ball (album)|self-titled debut]], although this album was not released until 1994. Logan left Curb in the early 1990s, then he released an album called ''Something Strange'' in Europe in 1995.<ref name="oldies"/> This album produced multiple singles on the European country singles charts, including two top-20 hits.<ref name="baby"/>

Logan was honored in 2002 with a display at the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in [[Renfro Valley, Kentucky]]. One year later, he released his third album, ''Cartersville, Kentucky Country Boy'',<ref name="baby"/> followed by ''I Am What I Am'' in 2009.
