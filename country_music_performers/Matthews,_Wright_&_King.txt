'''Matthews, Wright & King''' was an American [[country music]] group formed in 1991. The band, Raymond Matthews (born October 13, 1956), Woody Wright (born October 10, 1957) and Tony King (born June 27, 1957), was put together by [[Columbia Records]] producer Larry Strickland after [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] left the label, as an attempt to keep a viable country band on that label. Wright had previously been in another band called Memphis.

Though they enjoyed video success on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] as well as touring with [[Reba McEntire]] for two seasons, their highest charting radio single, "The Power of Love," peaked at No. 41 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart in 1992. It was the title track of their debut album, issued that same year on [[Columbia Records]]. The trio dissolved shortly after the release of their second album, ''Dream Seekers''.

Since disbanding, Tony King joined [[Brooks & Dunn]]'s backing band and was also briefly engaged to [[Wynonna Judd]], Woody Wright found success as a [[gospel music|gospel]] songwriter, producer and solo artist, while Raymond Matthews returned to his native Alabama and a successful contracting business.

In 2013, Raymond Matthews and his daughter, Ashley Matthews Mobley, released an album entitled ''Come Home''.  The album is a compilation of gospel songs written by Raymond. Production and recording took place at Dugger Mountain Music Hall near Heflin, Alabama.
