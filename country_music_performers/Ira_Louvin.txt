==Biography==
Ira Louvin was born in [[Section, Alabama]], and played together with his brother, [[Charlie Louvin|Charlie]], in the [[close harmony]] tradition as [[the Louvin Brothers]]. They were heavily influenced by [[the Delmore Brothers]] and Monroe Brothers. Ira played mandolin with [[Charlie Monroe]], guitar player of the Monroe Brothers in the early 1940s. The Louvin Brothers' songs were heavily influenced by their Baptist faith and warned against sin.

Ira was notorious for his drinking and short temper. He married four times, his third wife having shot him multiple times in the chest and hand after he allegedly beat her.<ref>{{cite news|title='Opry' Singer Star Shot; Wife Jailed|newspaper=The Miami Herald|date=February 21, 1963|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4881654/ira-louvin-shooting-1963/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20220216142651/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4881654/ira-louvin-shooting-1963/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2022-02-16|access-date=February 16, 2022}}</ref> He died on June 20, 1965, when a drunken driver struck his car in [[Williamsburg, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Neil|title=The Pop Life|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 28, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/28/arts/the-pop-life-500887.html?pagewanted=1|access-date=January 22, 2010}}</ref> At the time, a warrant for Louvin's arrest had been issued on a DUI charge.
