==Discography==
===''Undertow'' (2023)===

In February 2023 Hellbound Glory flew to England to record a session with music producers Paul Gorry and George Shilling, after they caught a show with Shooter and Leroy at the Whiskey-a-Go Go in Hollywood. The first single from the session was released in July 2023 and was described as "not of this world". The recordings take a lot of influence from Irish and British folk music, using Uilleann pipes and a string section.

The song peaked in the iTunes Country charts at number 2

===''Nobody Knows You'' (2022)===
Again produced by Shooter Jennings and released on his Black Country Rock label, it takes its name from a cover of the old blues standard “[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]”.<ref>[https://hellboundglory.bandcamp.com/album/the-immortal-hellbound-glory-nobody-knows-you The Immortal Hellbound Glory: Nobody Knows You].</ref>

The Saving Country Music review summarised its contents like this: "''Nobody Knows You'' sees Leroy Virgil moving away from some of his writing of witty one-liners and self-indulgent characters to more story-based compositions. “Can’t Wait to Never See You Again” and “Word Gets Around” take classic approaches to country songwriting, but in a way that still is distinct to Leroy. But the album also finds a more folk-oriented approach to songwriting as well. “13 Corners” about the winding mountain roads of the interior West weaves a cautionary tale more indicative of writing from the 50s and 60s, while “Evacuation Song” about the [[Paradise, California#2018 fire|fire that destroyed the town of Paradise]] and killed 85 people in 2018 is something Woody Guthrie might have written if he was still around.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/album-review-hellbound-glorys-nobody-knows-you/|title=Album Review – Hellbound Glory's "Nobody Knows You" - Saving Country Music|date=September 30, 2022|website=www.savingcountrymusic.com}}</ref>
