'''Marley's Ghost''' is a band based in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Northern California]] which has existed since the mid-1980s and has recorded 12 albums. While their music has a strong [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] emphasis, their musical style is diverse. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine has described them as "a decidedly unusual band, as capable of reanimating [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk songs]] as they are traditional [[Celtic music|Celtic]] fare, [[honky tonk]] and [[reggae]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybergrass.com/modules.php?name%3DNews%26file%3Darticle%26sid%3D7059 |title=Cybergrass Bluegrass Music News: Marley's Ghost taps Cowboy Jack Clement for new CD, 'Ghost Town' |access-date=2009-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104033746/http://cybergrass.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7059 |archivedate=2010-01-04 }}</ref>

==History==
Dan Wheetman, Jon Wilcox, and Mike Phelan met in March 1986 in the [[San Fernando Valley]] during [[Saint Patrick's Day]] shows. That winter, Wheetman went to Littlefield's studio to record a solo album, bringing Wilcox and Phelan. They ended up recording the first three Marley's Ghost albums before completing Wheetman's solo album.<ref name=MG-chronicle-2017>{{cite web |url=http://conqueroo.com/marleysghostbio.html|title=Marley's Ghost|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=June 13, 2017|author=Joel Selvin}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Van Dyke Parks]] produced ''Spooked'', and artist [[Robert Crumb]] illustrated the album cover. (Crumb and Wheetman knew each other from an earlier musical venture, [[R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders]], of which Wheetman was a member for a short time in the mid-1970s.)<ref>Lynch, Megan.
