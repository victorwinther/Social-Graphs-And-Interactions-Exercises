However, he wanted to learn to play guitar as well. At age 13, he received a guitar for his birthday.<ref name="cmt"/>

==Musical career==

===''Days of Our Lives''===
In 2002, Otto met Scott Parker of [[Mercury Nashville Records]], who signed him to a record deal that year.<ref name="cmt"/> His first single, "The Ball", peaked at No.&nbsp;45 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, while a second single, "Long Way Down", failed to chart at all. Due to the poor chart performance of these singles, Otto's debut album was delayed. "Days of Our Lives", his third release for the label, was released in late 2003, peaking at No.&nbsp;33 on the country charts.<ref name="cmt2">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1485753/20040315/otto_james.jhtml |title=Despite his ballads, James Otto wants to rock |access-date=July 24, 2007 |work=CMT.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Shortly after the song peaked, his debut album (also entitled ''[[Days of Our Lives (James Otto album)|Days of Our Lives]]'') was released on Mercury, and in 2004, Otto was signed as an opening act for [[Shania Twain]] on her [[Up! Tour]].<ref name="cmt"/> His fourth single for Mercury, "Sunday Morning and Saturday Night", peaked at No.&nbsp;58. After the song fell from the charts, Otto exited Mercury's roster. From there, he began working with the [[MuzikMafia]], a gathering of singer-songwriters founded by [[Big & Rich]], [[Gretchen Wilson]] and [[Cowboy Troy]]. Otto co-wrote songs and sang background vocals on two of Cowboy Troy's albums: ''[[Loco Motive]]'' and ''[[Black in the Saddle]]'', released in 2005 and early 2007, respectively.

===''Sunset Man'' and ''Shake What God Gave Ya''===
By mid-2007, Otto signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] Nashville. His first single for the label, "[[Just Got Started Lovin' You]]", was released at the end of that year as the lead-off single to his second album, ''[[Sunset Man]]''. The album was co-produced by Otto's brother-in-law, [[Jay DeMarcus]] of [[Rascal Flatts]], along with Big & Rich's [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]].<ref name="cw1">{{cite web|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/james_otto/feature/1345 |title=James Otto: Putting the Pieces Together |access-date=April 9, 2008 |date=March 2, 2008|work=[[Country Weekly]] (web exclusive) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401002042/http://www.countryweekly.com/james_otto/feature/1345 |archive-date=April 1, 2008 }}</ref> ''Sunset Man'' peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on [[Top Country Albums]] upon its April release.

The album's other two singles — "For You" and "These Are the Good Ole Days" — did not perform as well on the charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;39 and No.&nbsp;36 in September 2008 and January 2009, respectively.

In mid-2008, Otto was commissioned to perform a new theme song for the [[Atlanta Braves]], entitled "The Braves Play Here," composed by Greg Barnhill and Randy Wachtler for [[615 Music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article_entertainment.jsp?ymd=20080520&content_id=2735308&vkey=entertainment&fext=.jsp |title=A new voice for the Braves |access-date=May 21, 2008 |last=Miller |first=Doug |date=May 2, 2008|work=[[Major League Baseball]]}}</ref> He also co-wrote [[Jamey Johnson]]'s mid-2008 single "[[In Color (song)|In Color]]" with Johnson and [[Lee Thomas Miller]]. This song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] at the [[2008 Grammy Awards]], and received the 2008 [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Song of the Year, which is awarded to the songwriters.

Otto released a new single, "Since You Brought It Up", in April 2009. It peaked at number 37, and did not appear on a studio album. The song was followed by "[[Groovy Little Summer Song]]" in early 2010. It reached the Top 30 and served as the lead-off single from Otto's third album, ''[[Shake What God Gave Ya]]'', which was produced by [[Paul Worley]] and was released on September 14, 2010. The album's second single, "Soldiers & Jesus," was released to country radio on September 7, 2010, and reached a peak of number 34. In March 2011, Otto announced on his Twitter that he had exited Warner Bros. Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2011/03/03/james-otto-warner-bros-nashville-part-ways/|title=James Otto & Warner Bros. Nashville Part Ways|last=Wyland|first=Sarah|date=March 3, 2011|work=Great American Country|access-date=March 4, 2011}}</ref>

Otto also performed backing vocals on the original album cut of the song "Chicken & Biscuits", performed by [[country rap]] artist [[Colt Ford]] on his 2010 [[Chicken & Biscuits|album of the same name]]. The single version, however, features Rhean Boyer of [[Carolina Rain]] in place of Otto singing on backup. Otto also co-wrote [[Zac Brown Band]]'s 2012 single "[[No Hurry]]".
