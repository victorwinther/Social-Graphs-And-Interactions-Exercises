Mattel and her partner David Silver bought a [[fixer-upper]] motel in [[Palm Springs, California]], originally named Ruby Montana's Coral Sands Inn, for $1.9 million.

== Artistry ==
In addition to her comedic drag persona, Mattel is also a [[country folk]] singer-songwriter. In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mattel recounted that her grandfather was a country singer who taught her how to begin playing guitar. But, growing up, she hated country music and thought it was "old people music." However, she grew to love and appreciate country as an adult, recognizing its depth, complexity, and humor with artists like [[June Carter Cash]] and [[Dolly Parton]] especially contributing to her newfound appreciation. Mattel also said that she learned guitar by listening to [[George Jones]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Johnny Cash]]. Although she learned to play folk-country, the type of music she listened to on the radio was folk-pop from performers such as [[Jason Isbell]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Aimee Mann]], [[Michelle Branch]], and [[Kacey Musgraves]].<ref>{{cite magazine |date=March 29, 2018 |title=Drag Queen Trixie Mattel on Her Country Albums, Kacey Musgraves Obsession |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/rupaul-drag-race-trixie-mattel-country-albums-kacey-musgraves-w518524 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 4, 2018 |archive-date=June 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616220801/https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/rupaul-drag-race-trixie-mattel-country-albums-kacey-musgraves-w518524 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Currently, Mattel finds that her music is inspired by Miley Cyrus and Kacey Musgraves, referring to them as "two fringe-country kindred spirits."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-04-12 |title=Country-Singing Drag Queen Trixie Mattel On Her Surprise Success: 'Country Fans Are Perceived To Be More Closed-Minded Than They Really Are' |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/country-singing-drag-queen-trixie-mattel-on-her-surprise-success-country-fans-are-perceived-to-be-more-closed-minded-than-they-really-are_n_5acf7b24e4b0edca2cb739af |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=HuffPost |language=en}}</ref> Several of Mattel's influences for the finished version of her third studio album, ''Barbara,'' include [[The Go-Go's]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[The B-52's]], [[Fountains of Wayne]], [[Weezer]], [[Aimee Mann]], and [[The Click Five]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 21, 2020 |title=An AMA About Barbara! |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/f6ww20/comment/fi7qnpq/?context=3 |access-date=March 29, 2022 |website=[[Reddit]]}}</ref>
