'''Roscoe Holcomb''' (born '''Roscoe Halcomb''';<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://southernspaces.org/2008/john-cohen-eastern-kentucky-documentary-expression-and-image-roscoe-halcomb-during-folk-revival|title=John Cohen in Eastern Kentucky: Documentary Expression and the Image of Roscoe Halcomb During the Folk Revival|first=Scott L.|last=Matthews|date=July 27, 2008|volume=2008|journal=Southern Spaces|doi=10.18737/M74W3W|doi-access=free}}</ref> September 5, 1912 – February 1, 1981) was an American singer, [[banjo]] player, and [[guitarist]] from [[Daisy, Kentucky]]. A prominent figure in [[Appalachian folk music]],<ref name="PetrusCohen2015">{{cite book|author1=Stephen Petrus|author2=Ronald D. Cohen|title=Folk City: New York and the American Folk Music Revival|url=https://archive.org/details/folkcitynewyorka0000petr|url-access=registration|date=8 June 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-023103-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/folkcitynewyorka0000petr/page/183 183]–}}</ref> Holcomb was the inspiration for the term "high, lonesome sound", coined by folklorist and friend [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]]. The "high lonesome sound" term is now used to describe [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] singing, although Holcomb was not, strictly speaking, a bluegrass performer.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

==Performance style==
Holcomb's repertoire included [[old-time music]], [[hymns]], [[traditional music]] and [[blues]] ballads. In addition to playing the banjo and guitar, he was a competent [[harmonica]] and [[fiddle]] player, and sang many of his most memorable songs [[a cappella]]. Holcomb stated: "Up till then the blues were only inside me; [[Blind Lemon]] was the first to 'let out' the blues."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/116 116]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/116}}</ref>

Holcomb sang in a nasal style informed by the [[Old Regular Baptist]] vocal tradition. [[Bob Dylan]], a fan of Holcomb, described his singing as possessing "an untamed sense of control".<ref name="AllMusic_Untamed">{{AllMusic|album|mw0000019275|''An Untamed Sense of Control''}}</ref> He was also admired by the [[Stanley Brothers]] and [[Eric Clapton]], who cited Holcomb as his favorite country musician.<ref name="AllMusic_Untamed" />

==Life and career ==
A [[coal miner]], construction laborer and farmer for much of his life,<ref name="Wolfe2015">{{cite book|author=Charles K. Wolfe|title=Kentucky Country: Folk and Country Music of Kentucky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJIfBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154|date=5 February 2015|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|isbn=978-0-8131-4960-8|pages=154–}}</ref> Holcomb was not recorded until 1958, after which his career as a professional musician was bolstered by the [[folk revival]] in the 1960s. Holcomb gave his last live performance in 1978. Due to what he described as injuries he sustained during his long career as a laborer, Holcomb was eventually unable to work for more than short periods, and his later income came primarily from his music. Suffering from asthma and [[emphysema]] as a result of working in coal mines, he died in a nursing home in 1981, at the age of 68.<ref name="cohen2">{{cite book|author=John Cohen|title=The High & Lonesome Sound: The Legacy of Roscoe Holcomb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KpPYgEACAAJ|year=2012|publisher=Steidl|isbn=978-3-86930-254-6}}</ref>
