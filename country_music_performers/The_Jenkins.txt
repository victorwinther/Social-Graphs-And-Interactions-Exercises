The trio had two singles in the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: "Blame It on Mama" at No.&nbsp;34 and "Getaway Car" at No.&nbsp;38.

==Biography==
Nancy Jenkins and her daughters began to perform together when she started to produce the annual talent show at Kacie and Brodie's school.<ref name="cmt">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040706045314/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/jenkins/bio.jhtml CMT.com : The Jenkins : Biography]</ref> When Kacie was in sixth grade, the three performed [[The Judds]]' song "Guardian Angels" in a school production. Dennis Hysom, a local songwriter, who attended the show persuaded Nancy and her daughters to pursue a career as a country music trio.<ref name="cmt"/> The three then recorded a [[demo tape]], with Nancy writing some of the songs.<ref name="allmusic">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p657414/biography|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic ((( The Jenkins > Biography )))]</ref>

In 2003, the trio was signed to Capitol Records, working with singer-songwriter and record producer [[Rodney Crowell]] on the first album, to be called ''The Jenkins''.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="nmc">[http://netmusiccountdown.com/inc/artist.php?artist=The+Jenkins Net Music Countdown : The Jenkins]</ref> "Blame It on Mama" was released as an advance single in early 2004; the song was a minor top 40 hit in the ''Billboard'' U.S. [[Hot Country Songs]] chart.<ref name="allmusic"/> A second single, "Getaway Car", was released but the album itself was never released.
