'''Margo Smith''' (born '''Betty Lou Miller'''; April 9, 1939 – January 23, 2024) was an American [[Country music|country]] and [[Christian music|Christian]] music singer–songwriter. She had several years of country success during the 1970s, which included two number one hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. In the 1990s, she transitioned towards the Christian market and issued two successful albums. She is also known for her [[yodeling]] vocal skills and is often referred to as "The Tennessee Yodeler".<ref>{{cite web |title=Famed country singer Margo Smith headlining Villages show in April |url=https://www.villages-news.com/2019/03/10/famed-country-singer-margo-smith-headlining-villages-show-in-april/ |website=The Villages News |date=10 March 2019 |access-date=18 April 2021}}</ref>

Smith was born and raised in Ohio. During her childhood she learned how to sing and yodel. After graduating high school, Smith chose to pursue a career in education. For nearly a decade Smith taught elementary school and started a family with her first husband. In her thirties, she decided to begin a singing career full-time and also started songwriting. In 1971, she released her first album titled ''[[I'm a Lady (album)|I'm a Lady]]'' and developed a following. By 1975, Smith had signed with [[20th Century Fox Records]] and had her first major hit on the country charts with the song "[[There I Said It]]." She had further hits in the 1970s with songs like "[[Take My Breath Away (Margo Smith song)|Take My Breath Away]]" and "[[Don't Break the Heart That Loves You]]".

In 1979, Smith released the single "[[Still a Woman]]" and made significant changes to her musical persona. The transition helped to briefly elevate Smith's commercial country music career and she had further hits. By the early 1980s, Smith regretted making stylistic changes to her career and left her recording contract. She released music independently during the 1980s while also issuing albums through major labels. In the 1990s, Smith transitioned towards Christian music and recording two albums with her daughter, Holly. The pair won awards for their collaborative music and performed for several years. In later years, Smith continued performing as a solo act at her residence in Florida.

Jim Worbois found that Smith's 1977 album, ''Happiness'' included songs that "would have sounded equally at home at pop radio" while finding a place with "pure country".<ref name="Happiness"/> Author Kurt Wolff noted a similar theme in her Warner Bros. albums, finding that their production often incorporated heavy elements country pop.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=454}}

Smith's yodeling vocal style has also been observed by journalists and writers. Writers Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann found that she often incorporated "quasi-yodel vocal breaks" into her singing performances.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=358}} Tony Violanti of ''The Villages-News'' also found Smith's yodeling to display emotion: "Smith may have tiny physical stature but her voice can crackle with emotion."<ref name="Villages 2">{{cite web |last1=Violanti |first1=Tony |title=Margo Smith returns to singing, yodeling months after near-fatal accident |url=https://www.villages-news.com/2015/02/07/margo-smith-returns-singing-yodeling-months-near-fatal-accident/ |website=The Villages-News |date=7 February 2015 |access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref> In a 2006 interview, Smith explained that her yodeling style is created from a vocal break in her voice known as a "glottal catch". "Not just anybody can yodel. You have to have the ability to have that flip in your voice," she commented.<ref name="Lancaster"/>

Smith's image has also been a subject of discussion among writers. Authors of music publications have pointed out that Smith's music helped provide an outlet for middle-aged women attempting to rekindle romantic relationships.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=453-54}}{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=357-58}} Kurt Wolff of ''Country Music: The Rough Guide'' explained that "few singers spoke so unabashedly of attempting to reinvigorate love's fading fires, especially from a woman's perspective." Wolff further commented that Smith's songwriting contained "lyrical boldness" that helped provide voice to "middle-aged couples who'd been together for years."{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=453}} Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann remarked that her concerts of the late 1970s were among "the era's flashiest show queen stage routines."{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=357}}

==Personal life and death==
Smith was married twice. Her first marriage was to [[bank]]er Ken Smith. Together the couple had two children: Jeff (born 1964) and Holly (born 1968). For many years, the couple lived in New Carlisle, Ohio,<ref name="New Carlisle"/> before moving to Nashville to further her career.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=453}} After she had several years of commercial success, the couple separated. Claims were later made by her former manager, Bob Fry, that she had been engaging in a romantic relationship with him. She fired Fry in 1981 and he later filed a lawsuit claiming that he was let go because she refused to have a continued sexual affair with him.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=358}} In 1982, Smith wed business professional Richard Cammeron, who would become her career manager. The pair also established the record label, Cammeron Records, where Smith released several singles and albums.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=453}}<ref name="Allmusic"/>

In 1985, the Cammeron's Nashville home was destroyed in a house fire where they lost many material possessions. A fundraiser was later created to help the couple rebuild.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kirby |first1=Kip |title=Nashville Scene |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=April 6, 1985 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCQEAAAAMBAJ&q=margo+smith+richard+cammeron+house+fire&pg=PT100 |access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref>

In August 2014, Smith was involved in a near fatal head-on car collision near her home in [[The Villages, Florida]]. She suffered a shattered wrist, broken ankle, and multiple bruises. She spent three months at a local rehabilitation center and made a full recovery and was expected to return to performing in December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singer Margo Smith grateful to be back home and on road to recovery|url=http://www.villages-news.com/singer-margo-smith-grateful-back-road-recovery|website=Villages-News.com|date=25 December 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> Law enforcement officials later stated that Smith would not have survived the accident if she had not been wearing a seat belt or left her car's convertible top down.<ref name="Villages 2"/> In June 2016, Smith was hospitalized with double pneumonia, among other health concerns. She was sent to the intensive care unit where she remained until her health improved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Another remarkable comeback for famed country singer Margo Smith|url=http://www.villages-news.com/another-remarkable-comeback-famed-country-singer-margo-smith|website=Villages-News.com|date=25 June 2016 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Smith later made a full-recovery and began performing in the fall of 2016. "I feel as well as I can be and I feel great singing in front of all these people," she commented.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Violanti |first1=Tony |title=Margo Smith cheats death one more time, makes triumphant return to the stage |url=https://www.villages-news.com/2016/09/30/margo-smith-cheats-death-one-time-makes-triumphant-return-stage/ |website=The Villages-News |date=30 September 2016 |access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref>

Smith died on January 23, 2024, in Franklin, Tennessee, at the age of 84, from complications of a stroke she suffered two days earlier.<ref name="Springfield"/>
