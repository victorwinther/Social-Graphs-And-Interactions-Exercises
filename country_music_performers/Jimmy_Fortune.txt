==Biography==
Fortune grew up in [[Nelson County, Virginia]], where he attended Nelson County High School in [[Lovingston, Virginia]].<ref name="cleveland">{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/10/statlers_jimmy_fortune_talks_h.html |title=Statlers' Jimmy Fortune talks 'Hits & Hymns' with PD critic (and former classmate) |first=Chuck |last=Yarborough |work=The Plain Dealer |date=October 16, 2015 |access-date=May 29, 2017 |archive-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118082241/http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/10/statlers_jimmy_fortune_talks_h.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The original tenor of the Statler Brothers, [[Lew DeWitt]], heard Fortune sing at a local ski resort.  When DeWitt was suffering from [[Crohn's disease]] and needed a temporary replacement, he asked Fortune to come to audition for the band in Nashville.  Fortune started performing with the Statler Brothers in 1982, originally as a temporary replacement for DeWitt. He joined the group permanently later in the year when DeWitt decided to quit the group due to his illness.<ref name="cleveland"/>

Fortune wrote several number-one songs that were recorded by the [[Statler Brothers]], including "[[Elizabeth (Statler Brothers song)|Elizabeth]]", "[[Too Much on My Heart]]", and "[[My Only Love (song)|My Only Love]]". "[[More Than a Name on a Wall]]" was a top ten country hit. "Elizabeth" recently was a top bluegrass release for [[Dailey & Vincent]]. He spent 21 years touring, singing, and performing with the Statler Brothers.
