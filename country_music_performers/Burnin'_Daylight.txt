==History==
Burnin' Daylight was formed in 1995 by [[Sonny LeMaire]], Kurt Howell, and Marc Beeson. LeMaire was formerly a member of [[Exile (American band)|Exile]],<ref>[http://www.exileband.com/members.htm Exile Members]</ref> and Howell, formerly of [[Southern Pacific (band)|Southern Pacific]] and later a solo artist for [[Reprise Records]].<ref name="Cst">[http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=342 Burnin' Daylight - Burnin' Daylight]</ref> Marc Beeson was a Nashville songwriter who had previously charted a solo single on [[BNA Records]] in the early 1990s.<ref name="oldies">[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Burnin-Daylight.html Burnin' Daylight biography: Oldies.com]</ref> The group had originally assumed the name The Loose Cannons, but was forced to change its name to Burnin' Daylight because another band had the same name.<ref name="oldies"/> Originally, songwriters [[Trey Bruce]] and [[Rob Crosby]] were slated to be members of Burnin' Daylight as well. However, they decided to focus on their respective solo careers instead.<ref name="oldies"/>

Initially, Burnin' Daylight was intended to be only a live band. They eventually sent a tape to [[Mike Curb]], head of the [[Curb Records]] label, who signed the group in 1997.<ref name="oldies"/> In April of that year, Burnin' Daylight released its eponymous debut album. They charted three singles on the ''Billboard'' country music charts, including a Top 40 hit in "Say Yes". Robert Loy of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a negative review, criticizing it as formulaic in nature.<ref name="Cst"/>

In 1997, the [[Academy of Country Music]] nominated Burnin' Daylight for the Top New Vocal Duo or Group award, but the band lost to [[Ricochet (band)|Ricochet]].

Since disbanding in 1998, former bass guitarist [[Sonny LeMaire]] has written several singles for other artists, including the Number One hit "[[Beautiful Mess (Diamond Rio song)|Beautiful Mess]]" by [[Diamond Rio]], "[[She Thinks She Needs Me]]" by [[Andy Griggs]], and "[[Fall (Clay Walker song)|Fall]]" by [[Clay Walker]] (also recorded by [[Kimberley Locke]]). All of these were collaborations with [[Shane Minor]] and [[Clay Mills]]. LeMaire has also since reunited with Exile.
