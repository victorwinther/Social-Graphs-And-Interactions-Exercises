==Biography==
===Early life===
From early on, Keb' Mo's parents, who were from Louisiana and Texas, instilled in him a great appreciation for the [[blues]] and [[gospel music]].

===Career===
Keb' Mo' started his musical career playing the [[steel drum]]s in a [[calypso music|calypso]] band. He moved on to play in a variety of blues and backup bands throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He first started recording in the early 1970s with [[Jefferson Airplane]] violinist [[Papa John Creach]] through an R&B group. Creach hired him when Moore was 21 years old and Moore appeared on four of Creach's albums: ''[[Filthy!]]'', ''[[Playing My Fiddle for You]]'', ''[[I'm the Fiddle Man]]'' and ''[[Rock Father]]''.

Moore was also a staff writer for [[A&M Records]] and arranged demos for Almo – Irving music. Keb' Mo's debut, ''[[Rainmaker (Keb' Mo')|Rainmaker]]'', was released on [[Chocolate City Records]], a subsidiary of [[Casablanca Records]], in 1980. He was further immersed in the blues with his long stint in the Whodunit Band, headed by [[Bobby "Blue" Bland]] producer [[Monk Higgins]]. Moore [[Jam (music)|jammed]] with [[Albert Collins]] and [[Big Joe Turner]] and emerged as an inheritor of a guarded tradition and as a genuine original.

Keb' Mo' has appeared on stage (1990–1993) in several versions of the musical [[Spunk (play)|Spunk]], by [[George C. Wolfe]], an adaptation of three short stories by [[Zora Neale Hurston]].
