'''Roy D. Mercer''' was a fictional character created by American [[disc jockey]]s Brent Douglas and Phil Stone on radio station [[KMOD-FM]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Douglas, who performed Mercer's voice, used the character as a vehicle for comedy sketches in which he performed [[prank call]]s. The two released twelve albums of prank call recordings under the Roy D. Mercer name via [[Virgin Records]] and [[Capitol Records]]. The character was essentially retired in 2013 after Stone's death.

==History==
Brent Douglas and Phil Stone, [[disc jockey]]s at rock music radio station [[KMOD-FM]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], created the Roy D. Mercer character in 1993.<ref name="oak">{{cite web |url=http://www.oakridger.com/stories/121099/int_1209990052.html |title=Roy D.

Originally, the prank call sketches were a part of KMOD's morning show. By 1997, [[Capitol Records]] Nashville began issuing the sketches on compact disc. The first was titled ''How Big a Boy Are Ya?, Volume 1'', in reference to one of Mercer's [[catch phrase]]s.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p200310|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Roy D. Mercer > Biography ))) |accessdate=2007-12-02 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Eleven additional compilation albums have been released on the Capitol and [[Virgin Records]] labels. A Virgin Records Nashville executive noted that Mercer's early albums managed to sell between 250,000 and 300,000 copies, primarily due to word of mouth, without any promotion to consumers or radio airplay of the album tracks.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roy D.

In most of the sketches, Mercer will demand that the recipient of a call pay him money for some incident, and if the recipient refuses, he will threaten them with violence. Mercer has been described as speaking with "a mush-mouthed Southern drawl" and his style of comedy has been described as "not exactly obscene ... [but] border[ing] on offensive".<ref name="mccall">{{cite news |title=Frankly Speaking: Country comedy, like country music, tries to keep up with the times |first=Michael |last=McCall |newspaper=Nashville Scene |date=1998-11-26 |url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/frankly-speaking/Content?oid=1182696}}</ref> Many of the recipients of the calls are suggested by their friends who supply Mercer with information about the potential recipients.<ref name="mccall"/> Three notable people that Douglas and Stone had called were [[Bill Goldberg]] (”Roy Vs. Goldberg”), cinematographer Barry Markowitz, as suggested by [[Billy Bob Thornton]] (“Yankee in a Strange Land”), and Chris Bray, production manager for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] (“Tragic Carpet Ride”).

On October 12, 2012, the Phil and Brent Show ended its 27-year run with KMOD-FM radio. Forty days later, on November 21, Phil Stone died from causes related to heart disease at the age of 57.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former 'Phil and Brent' morning show host Phil Stone dies|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=20121121_11_0_PhilSt734042|accessdate=November 24, 2012|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|date=November 21, 2012}}</ref>

==John Bean's "Leroy Mercer" character of the 1980s==
Many claim that Roy D. Mercer was inspired by "Leroy Mercer," a character created in [[Tennessee]] by [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] resident John R. Bean, who made prank calls circulated by hand-to-hand tape exchange in the early 1980s. Leroy Mercer, voiced by John Bean, also called individuals and businesses threatening an "ass-whuppin".<ref>{{cite news|last=Bean |first=Betty |title=Tales of Bean More anecdotes of John Bean's sly sense of humor |url=http://www.metropulse.com/news/2008/jul/30/tales-bean/ |accessdate=26 July 2010 |newspaper=[[Metro Pulse]] |date=2008-07-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194710/http://www.metropulse.com/news/2008/jul/30/tales-bean/ |archivedate=February 26, 2014 }}</ref>  There are many parallels and similarities to the calls, with Roy D.
