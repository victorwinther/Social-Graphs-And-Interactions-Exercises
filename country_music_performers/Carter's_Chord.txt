'''Carter's Chord''' was an American [[country music]] group composed of sisters Becky Scott, Emily Fortney, and Joanna Ott, all of whom are singer-songwriters and vocalists. They are also the three daughters of Barny and Carter Roberston, both of whom played in [[Waylon Jennings]]' road band The Waylors in the 1970s; Emily Fortney is also married to Marc "Butter" Fortney of [[Trailer Choir]], another country music group.

After several years of performing locally, the trio was signed in 2006 to Show Dog Nashville (now [[Show Dog-Universal Music]]), a record label owned by country singer [[Toby Keith]]. Their debut single, "Young Love", reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as did its followup "Different Breed." Both are included on the group's debut album, which was issued to digital retailers in June 2008.
