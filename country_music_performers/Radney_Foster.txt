'''Radney Muckleroy Foster''' (born July 20, 1959)<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p31176|pure_url=yes}} |title=Radney Foster biography |access-date=2008-05-12 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> is an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter, musician and [[music producer]]. Initially a songwriter in Nashville, Tennessee, Foster made his recording debut as part of the [[Foster & Lloyd]] duo, recording three studio albums and with nine singles on the country charts.

Foster began his solo career in 1992 and his album ''[[Del Rio, TX 1959]]'' produced four consecutive Top 40 hits. However, his commercial success waned with the release subsequent albums such as ''[[Labor of Love (Radney Foster album)|Labor of Love]]'' (1995), ''[[See What You Want to See]]'' (1999), ''[[Are You Ready for the Big Show?]]'', ''[[Another Way to Go]]'' (2002) and ''This World We Live In'' (2006). Overall, Foster has had thirteen songs on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the Top Ten hits "Just Call Me Lonesome" (#10, 1992) and "Nobody Wins" (#2, 1993). His songs have been recorded by [[Gary Allan]], [[Sara Evans]], [[Keith Urban]], [[Hootie and the Blowfish]], and [[Jack Ingram]].

==Early life and education==
Foster was born in [[Del Rio, Texas]], as the second of four children. His father was a [[lawyer]] who sang and played guitar<ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Radney-Foster.html |title=Radney Foster biography |access-date=2008-05-12 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> and by age 12, Foster began playing the guitar as well, and by 14, he began writing songs.<ref name="allmusic"/>

After graduating from [[high school]], Foster attended [[University of the South]] in [[Sewanee, Tennessee]], where he became a member of the Gamma Sigma chapter of [[Phi Gamma Delta]]. He dropped out in 1979 and at the advice of veteran songwriter [[Randy Goodrum]],<ref>Builta, David. "Del Rio Native Signs Contract With RCA." Del Rio News-Herald 22 Feb 1987: 11</ref> moved to Nashville to pursue a music career. Foster later returned to college at Sewanee {{where?|date=August 2019}} and completed his degree, while performing at local venues in his spare time.<ref name="oldies"/>

==Career==
===1985 to 1990===
Foster moved to Nashville in 1985 and found work at [[MTM Records|MTM]] Publishing Company as a songwriter. There he met Bill Lloyd and they co-wrote the song "Since I Found You" which became a Top Ten hit for the [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]].<ref name="allmusic"/> In 1986 Foster formed the duo [[Foster & Lloyd]] and they received a recording contract with [[RCA Records]] Nashville. Between 1987 and 1990, they recorded three studio albums and had nine singles on the country charts. The highest-peaking of these was their debut single  "[[Crazy Over You]]", a No.&nbsp;4 hit in 1987. The two parted ways in 1990 to pursue solo careers.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="oldies"/> Later, in 1990, their song "[[Don't Go Out]]" was released by [[Tanya Tucker]] in 1990 as a duet with [[T. Graham Brown]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/tennessee-woman-mw0000204430|title=Tennessee Woman - Tanya Tucker &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 4, 2020}}</ref>

===1991 to 2000===
Two years later Foster signed with [[Arista Nashville]] and released the album ''[[Del Rio, TX 1959]]'' (named for Foster's place and year of birth).<ref name="oldies"/> The album produced two consecutive Top Ten hits: "Just Call Me Lonesome" and "Nobody Wins", which respectively reached No.&nbsp;10 and No.&nbsp;2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Two later singles, "Easier Said Than Done" and "Hammer and Nails", also reached Top 40, peaking at No.&nbsp;20 and No.&nbsp;34, respectively.

In 1994, Foster began work on his second album, which was originally to be titled ''Never Say Die''.<ref name="new">{{ cite journal |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |date=April 1995|title=Willing to Walk: Radney Foster's Soul Searching Labor of Love |journal=New Country |volume=2 |issue=5 |issn=1086-1076 }}</ref> After the lead single "Labor of Love" failed to make the Top 40, Arista delayed the album's release so that it would not compete with the compilation album ''[[Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard]]'', to which Foster had contributed the track "The Running Kind".<ref name="new"/> [[Steve Ripley]], who recorded on Arista as lead singer of [[The Tractors]] at the time, remixed the following single "Willin' to Walk" and the album was released under the title ''[[Labor of Love (Radney Foster album)|Labor of Love]]'' in April 1995.<ref name="new"/> Later that year, Foster contributed the song "Close Up the Honky Tonks" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/red-hot-country-mw0000622534|title=Red Hot + Country - Various Artists &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 4, 2020}}</ref>

Foster's third album was 1999's ''[[See What You Want to See]]'', featuring a more [[pop music|pop]]-oriented sound and backing vocals from [[Darius Rucker]] of [[Hootie & the Blowfish]]. The album produced a charting single in "Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)", a duet with [[Emmylou Harris]] which peaked at No.&nbsp;74 on the country charts and was recorded by the [[Dixie Chicks]] in 2003. Two of the album's cuts were later covered by [[Keith Urban]], who released his renditions as singles: "[[Raining on Sunday]]" from ''[[Golden Road (album)|Golden Road]]'', and "[[I'm In]]" from ''[[Defying Gravity (Keith Urban album)|Defying Gravity]]''. The latter was also a single for [[The Kinleys]], whose version Foster produced, in 2000.<ref name="scoop">{{cite journal|title=The Scoop: Keith Urban Is "In"|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|date=31 May 2010|volume=17|issue=22|pages=8|issn=1074-3235}}</ref>

===2001 to 2011===
In 2001, Foster signed to [[Dualtone Records]]<ref name="allmusic"/> and released ''[[Are You Ready for the Big Show?]]'', included the song "Texas in 1880", which Foster had originally recorded as a member of Foster & Lloyd. The new version featured [[Pat Green]] and peaked at No.&nbsp;54 on the country charts. Foster's next album was 2002's ''Another Way to Go''. One of its tracks, "[[A Real Fine Place to Start]]" (another collaboration with Ducas) became a No.&nbsp;1 hit single for [[Sara Evans]] on her 2005 album ''[[Real Fine Place]]''. Foster's released ''This World We Live In'' in 2006 but none of the songs made the country charts. In 2005, Foster released a website-only album titled ''And Then There's Me: The Back Porch Sessions'' containing 11 acoustic tracks. Foster produced two albums for the [[Randy Rogers Band]]: their 2006 album ''[[Just a Matter of Time (Randy Rogers Band album)|Just a Matter of Time]]'' and 2008's ''[[Randy Rogers Band (album)|Randy Rogers Band]]''.

Foster began his own music label called ''Devil's River''. In September 2009 Foster released the album ''Revival'' under the band name "Radney Foster and the Confessions" and a feature-length DVD documentary on the making of the album.  The 90-minute film was co-produced by Foster and his wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2009/08/radney-foster-bbr-steve-wariner-and-jabbrrr/ |title=Radney Foster, BBR, Steve Wariner and JabbRRR : MusicRow – Nashville's Music Industry Publication – News, Songs From Music City |publisher=Musicrow.com |date=2009-08-31 |access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref>  Keith Urban recorded Foster's song [[I'm In#Keith Urban version|"I'm In"]] for his 2009 album [[Defying Gravity (Keith Urban album)|''Defying Gravity'']] and it became a No.&nbsp;2 single.

In December 2010, Foster rejoined the Foster & Lloyd duo and they released the album "It's Already Tomorrow" in 2011.

Foster is the host of the music anthology series "Crossroads" on CMT.

===2017===
In early 2017, Foster starred in ''Troubadour'', a country musical by [[Sugarland]] member [[Kristian Bush]] and playwright Janece Shaffer. The production took place in Atlanta, at the Tony Award-winning [[Alliance Theatre]]. Foster also appears in the 2017 film ''Beauty Mark''.

In September 2017, Foster released ''For You To See The Stars'', a CD/book duo. The collection of short stories is his first print publication and follows the stories on the CD, which included nine new songs and a special re-recording of "[[Raining on Sunday]]", Foster's single that was later recorded by [[Keith Urban]] for his album ''[[Golden Road (album)|Golden Road]]''.

''For You To See The Stars'' is Foster at his classic storytelling best, both as a seasoned singer-songwriter and a soulful writer of prose. Although both components stand alone as separate pieces of art, they are meant to be enjoyed together. When coupled, the book and CD give fans a deeper insight into the subconscious of Foster's storytelling. Long-time [[The Tennessean|Tennessean]] journalist [[Peter Cooper]] commented, “Radney Foster writes with uncommon depth of emotion, humor, empathy, and clarity. I’m going to ask him how he does it, and if he tells me I’ll let you in on his secret. Until then, it’s best that we read, wonder, and revel.”

==Personal life==
A native of Del Rio, Texas, Foster moved to Tennessee to attend the University of the South at Sewanee. He lives in Nashville with his wife Cyndi and three children, Julien, Jackson, and Mojo.<ref name="new"/>
