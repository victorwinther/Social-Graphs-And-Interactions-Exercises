'''Douglas Anderson Supernaw''' (September 26, 1960{{spnd}}November 13, 2020) was an American [[country music]] artist. After several years performing as a local musician throughout the state of [[Texas]], he signed with [[BNA Records]] in 1993.

Supernaw released four studio albums in his career: ''[[Red and Rio Grande]]'' (1993), ''[[Deep Thoughts from a Shallow Mind]]'' (1994), ''[[You Still Got Me (Doug Supernaw album)|You Still Got Me]]'' (1995), and ''Fadin' Renegade'' (1999). Between 1993 and 1996, he charted 11 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, including "[[I Don't Call Him Daddy]]", his only No. 1 single, in late 1993.

==Biography==
Doug Supernaw was born on September 26, 1960, in [[Bryan, Texas]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p41819|pure_url=yes}} |title=Doug Supernaw biography |access-date=January 5, 2008 |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> He grew up in Inwood Forest and was an avid golfer as well as a member of his high school golf team. His mother, a fan of country music, exposed him to acts such as [[George Jones]] and [[Gene Watson]], by whose works he would later be influenced.<ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Doug-Supernaw.html |title=Doug Supernaw biography |access-date=January 5, 2008 |work=Oldies.com |archive-date=November 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115124105/https://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Doug-Supernaw.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Supernaw later attended college on a [[golfing]] scholarship.<ref name="allmusic"/> After dropping out of college in 1979, he briefly worked on an [[Oil platform|oil rig]] before serving as a musician in local bands.<ref name="oldies"/> He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1987, where he found work as a session songwriter. After four years in Nashville, he moved back to Texas, where he founded a band called Texas Steel.<ref name="oldies"/>

===1993–1995: BNA Records===
An [[A&R]] executive for [[RCA Records]] discovered Supernaw and signed him to the label's BNA Entertainment (now [[BNA Records]]) division in 1993.<ref name="oldies"/> That year, Supernaw released his debut album, ''[[Red and Rio Grande]]''. From the album, four singles were released, starting with "Honky Tonkin' Fool", which did not enter Top 40 on the ''Billboard'' country music charts. "Reno", the second single, reached Top 5 soon afterward, while its follow-up, "[[I Don't Call Him Daddy]]" (previously a No.&nbsp;86 single in 1988 for [[Kenny Rogers]]), became Supernaw's only Number One single by the end of the year.<ref name="oldies"/> The album went on to achieve gold certification in the United States.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=Doug Supernaw, '90s country singer of 'Reno,' dead at 60|url=https://apnews.com/article/houston-nashville-texas-a286ac06afad4c1cd2462dbd9370f4c3|first=Kristin M.|last=Hall|date=November 13, 2020|access-date=November 14, 2020|work=Associated Press|archive-date=November 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115124104/https://apnews.com/article/houston-nashville-texas-a286ac06afad4c1cd2462dbd9370f4c3|url-status=live}}</ref>

A series of injuries nearly ended Supernaw's career after his first album's release. After recovering from a broken neck suffered while [[surfing]], he was involved in a head-on car collision. Finally, he was hospitalized after a nearly-fatal case of [[food poisoning]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Once he had recovered from the food poisoning, he recorded his second album for BNA, 1994's ''[[Deep Thoughts from a Shallow Mind]]''. Of the album's three singles, only the [[Dennis Linde]]-penned "[[What'll You Do About Me]]" (previously a single in 1984 for [[Steve Earle]], and in 1992 for [[the Forester Sisters]], and recorded by [[Randy Travis]] on his 1987 album ''[[Always & Forever (Randy Travis album)|Always & Forever]]'') entered Top 40 on the country music charts. Shortly after the second album's release, he exited BNA's roster.<ref name=Lomax>{{cite news|title=Doug Supernaw|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/doug-supernaw-6575858|first=John Nova|last=Lomax|date=May 10, 2007|access-date=November 14, 2020|newspaper=Houston Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807040500/https://www.houstonpress.com/music/doug-supernaw-6575858|archive-date=August 7, 2020}}</ref>
