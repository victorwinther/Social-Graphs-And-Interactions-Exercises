'''Shelly West''' (born May 23, 1956) is an [[United States|American]] [[country music]] [[singing|singer]]. Her mother was the country music star [[Dottie West]], whose career spanned three decades. The younger West reached her peak in popularity during the 1980s before mostly retiring in the wake of her mother's death.

==Biography==

===1981–1987===
West was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and rose to prominence at the same time as her mother Dottie was reinventing herself as a [[country pop]] star, and Shelly's style was not significantly different from that of her mother's. West is best known for her hit [[duet]]s with [[David Frizzell]], especially their number-one hit "[[You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma]]". She also was a successful solo artist, having her own number-one hit, "[[José Cuervo (song)|José Cuervo]]" in 1983. West was married to [[Gary Hood]] 1983-2000.

===1987–1992: Retirement===
West did reunite with Frizzell for a few shows in the late 1980s. West married Garry Hood in 1983 and had twin sons.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p137248/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography at Allmusic.com]</ref> In 1990, Shelly toured with her mother, Dottie; together, they were popular on the road. On August 30, 1991, Dottie was involved in a major car accident, eventually dying five days later, on September 4, from injuries sustained in the accident. West was a technical adviser for a television biopic about her mother's life, ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', produced by and starring actress [[Michele Lee]]. At that point, amid major changes in the country music industry that impacted the careers of many established country stars, the younger West retired to focus on her family.

===Post-retirement===
In June 2005, CMT honored Shelly and her duet partner, David Frizzell, when they were voted number six on its ''100 Greatest Duets Special''. Although they did not perform any songs, Shelly West and David Frizzell appeared on the special, for which West was interviewed. West appeared on numerous episodes of ''Country Family Reunion'' on [[RFD-TV]].

West has returned to performing occasionally since 2012. She reunited with David Frizzell for two shows on October 13, 2012, at the God and Country Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. The duo played another show on November 2, 2013 at the Americana Theater in Branson.
