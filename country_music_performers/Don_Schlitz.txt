==Songwriting career==

Schlitz' first hit as a songwriter was [[Kenny Rogers]]'s "[[The Gambler (song)|The Gambler]]", which became a [[Crossover music|crossover]] country hit upon its release in 1978, later becoming one of Rogers's [[signature song]]s.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/don-schlitz-mn0001760996 |title=Don Schlitz &#124; Biography |first=Sandra |last=Brennan |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=April 29, 2021 |archive-date=November 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201104162827/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/don-schlitz-mn0001760996 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, the song was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref name="librcong">{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-028/ | title=National Recording Registry Reaches 500 | work=Library of Congress | date=March 21, 2018 | access-date=March 21, 2018}}</ref> Since then, Schlitz has written numerous country songs and penned several hits for other country artists. Among his biggest hits are two Number One songs which he co-wrote with [[Paul Overstreet]], "[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]" by [[Randy Travis]] and "[[When You Say Nothing at All]]" by [[Keith Whitley]].

United States President [[George H. W. Bush]] also commissioned Schlitz to write a theme song for his "[[Points of Light Foundation & Volunteer Center National Network|Points of Light]]" program.<ref name="allmusic"/> This song, "Point of Light", was a No.&nbsp;3 country hit for Randy Travis in 1991.

Schlitz also worked with Kenny Rogers again in 1998. Rogers joked at the time that "every 20 years I will record a Don Schlitz song". The result was a [[baseball]]-themed hit single called "[[The Greatest (Kenny Rogers song)|The Greatest]]". Rogers also recorded several more of his songs in 2013 for his best-selling ''[[You Can't Make Old Friends (album)|You Can't Make Old Friends]]'' album.
