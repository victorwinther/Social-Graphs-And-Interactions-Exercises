===Country musician===
In 1937 in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], he formed The Bell Boys, a country Western singing group, named after their Bell Clothing sponsor.<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=431}}</ref> The group performed locally, made some recordings, and did frequent radio broadcasts over Oklahoma City's [[WKY]].<ref name="AMG"/> [[Johnny Bond]], Dick Reinhart, Scotty Harrell and Jack Cheney were members of the Bell Boys and later groups.<ref name="B-WEST"/>

During a tour through Oklahoma, the musician and movie star [[Gene Autry]] invited Wakely to come to California.<ref name="AMG"/> Autry felt the group might be a good addition to his new ''[[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch|Melody Ranch]]'' radio show, which debuted on [[CBS]] in January 1940.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The Wakely Trio joined the show in mid-1940. He stayed for a couple of years, then left because of movie commitments and a recording contract with Decca Records that ran from 1941&ndash;1942 through 1947. Johnny Bond stayed with the show for most of its run (the show left the air in 1956).<ref name="B-WEST"/>

===Recording company===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Wakely developed Shasta Records and owned two music publishing companies.<ref name="AMG"/> He converted part of his California ranch into a recording studio, producing recordings for himself as well as for other country Western performers, including [[Tex Williams]], [[Merle Travis]], Eddie Dean, [[Tex Ritter]] and [[Rex Allen]].<ref name="B-WEST"/> For his recording work, Wakely has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on Vine Street.<ref name="HWOF">{{cite web|last=Wakely|first=Jimmy|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame Directory|url=http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/icons/walk_directory.asp
