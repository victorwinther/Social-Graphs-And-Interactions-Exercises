==Early life==
Billy Strings was born William Lee Apostol on October 3, 1992, in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. His father died of a heroin overdose when he was two and his mother remarried Terry Barber, an accomplished amateur bluegrass musician whom Strings regards as his father. The family later moved to [[Morehead, Kentucky]], and then to [[Muir, Michigan]]. While he was still a preteen, his parents became addicted to methamphetamine. He left the family home at the age of 13 and went through a period of hard drug usage. His family eventually achieved sobriety; Billy stopped using hard drugs and drinking alcohol, becoming [[California sober|"California sober"]] and consuming only cannabis and similar "light drugs" (ie psychedelics).<ref name="RollingStoneJune2022">{{cite news |last1=Hudak |first1=Joseph |title=Drugs, Bluegrass, and Bass Fishing: How Billy Strings Outran His Past and Infiltrated the Mainstream |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/billy-strings-bluegrass-fishing-concert-1369241/ |access-date=25 August 2022 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=June 22, 2022}}</ref><ref name="northernexpress.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.northernexpress.com/news/feature/article-5963-the-amazing-billy-strings/|title=The Amazing Billy Strings|publisher=Northern Express}}</ref>
