'''Andrew Tyler Griggs''' (born August 13, 1973) is an American [[country music]] artist. He has released three albums for [[RCA Records]] Nashville (''[[You Won't Ever Be Lonely]]'', ''[[Freedom (Andy Griggs album)|Freedom]]'', and ''[[This I Gotta See]]'') and a fourth (''[[The Good Life (Andy Griggs album)|The Good Life]]'') for [[Montage Music Group]]. These four albums have accounted for 13 singles and 6 Top Tens on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart, the highest being "[[You Won't Ever Be Lonely (song)|You Won't Ever Be Lonely]]" and "[[She's More]]", both of which peaked at #2. He also charted "Grow Young With You", a cut from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Where the Heart Is (2000 film)|Where the Heart Is]]''.

He briefly attended [[Northeast Louisiana University]] before returning to his hometown in the early 1990s, where he became a [[Youth ministry|youth minister]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cjonline.com/stories/101901/wee_andygriggs.shtml#.WeREI-RDFOw |title=Andy Griggs: Country singer picks up the musical torch of his fallen brother &#124; CJOnline.com |access-date=2017-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016174320/http://cjonline.com/stories/101901/wee_andygriggs.shtml#.WeREI-RDFOw |archive-date=2017-10-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and began a family with his wife. He continued to work on his musical skills, however, and by 1999, he signed to a contract with [[RCA Records]] Nashville.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

==Musical career==
Griggs' debut album, ''[[You Won't Ever Be Lonely]]'', was issued in 1999 via RCA Records Nashville. Certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[RIAA]], the album accounted for five singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts. The first three singles — the title track, "I'll Go Crazy" and "She's More" — were all Top Ten hits, peaking at number 2, number 10 and number 2 respectively.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=172|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> "You Won't Ever Be Lonely" also had the sixth-longest chart run on the country charts in the 1990s decade, spending thirty-six weeks on the charts.<ref>Whitburn, p. 644</ref> Following "She's More" was a non-album song, "Grow Young With Me", recorded as a duet with [[Coley McCabe]], and after that, "Waitin' on Sundown" at number 50 and "You Made Me That Way" at number 19. Also included on the album was a duet with Griggs' idol [[Waylon Jennings]] in the track "Shine On Me", as well as a cover of Jennings' "Ain't Livin' Long Like This".

He released his second album, ''[[Freedom (Andy Griggs album)|Freedom]]'', in 2002. Although its lead-off single "How Cool Is That" peaked at number 22, the second single, "Tonight I Wanna Be Your Man", became his fourth Top Ten hit at number 7. Closing out this album was "Practice Life", a number 33 duet with [[Martina McBride]].

For 2003 and half of 2004, Griggs was absent from the country charts, although he, [[Montgomery Gentry]], and [[Blake Shelton]] performed uncredited guest vocals on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s 2003 single "[[The Truth About Men (song)|The Truth About Men]]". Mid-2004 saw the release of "[[She Thinks She Needs Me]]". Co-written by [[Shane Minor]], this song was the first single release from Griggs' third album, ''[[This I Gotta See]]'', also released in 2004.<ref name="allmusic"/> Although this song and follow-up "[[If Heaven]]" were both number 5 hits on the country charts, the album's third single, "This I Gotta See", stopped at number 58, and the fourth single ("I Never Had a Chance") failed to chart at all. By 2005, he had left RCA's roster, due to creative differences over his artistic control.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dailycollegian.com/2006/05/07/countrys-griggs-leaves-rca-continues-with-album-no-4/ |title=Country's Griggs leaves RCA, continues with album No. 4 : The Daily Collegian |access-date=2014-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316055420/http://dailycollegian.com/2006/05/07/countrys-griggs-leaves-rca-continues-with-album-no-4/ |archive-date=2014-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2007, Griggs signed to his second recording contract, this time with [[Montage Music Group]]. His first album for the label, ''[[The Good Life (Andy Griggs album)|The Good Life]]'', produced two low-charting singles in "Tattoo Rose" (co-written by Cole Deggs, lead singer of [[Cole Deggs & the Lonesome]]) and "What If It's Me". Three years later, he issued "Can I Get an Amen".

==Personal life==
Griggs has been married twice, first to Stephanie Sullivan in February 1995, but they were eventually separated. In 2005 Griggs married Renee, but they also eventually separated. He now has a son named Mason.{{cn|date=February 2024}}
