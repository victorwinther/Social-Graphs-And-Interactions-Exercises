After [[Paul Overstreet]] departed the country music trio [[S-K-O]] (formerly Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet), Bickhardt was recruited to take Overstreet's place in the trio. As a result, the group was renamed S-K-B (Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt). Bickhardt made his debut on the group's second and final album, 1987's ''No Easy Horses'' on MTM Records. This album contained several songs that he co-wrote, including two of its singles: "This Old House" and "Givers and Takers".<ref name="allmusic"/> S-K-B disbanded in 1989 after MTM  closed.

In 1993, Bickhardt and [[Thom Schuyler]] (also formerly of S-K-O) recorded the [[Christmas music]] album ''Precious Child''. He continued his songwriting, including hits for [[Stacy Dean Campbell]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Pam Tillis]], and [[The Kinleys]].<ref name="allmusic"/> He also co-wrote for [[Great Plains (Tennessee band)|Great Plains]], a band which included former [[Poco (band)|Poco]] member Jack Sundrud. Bickhardt and Sundrud co-wrote [[Ty Herndon]]'s 1998 Number One hit "[[It Must Be Love (Ty Herndon song)|It Must Be Love]]" as well.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Bickhardt returned to recording in 2001 with his first solo album, ''Easy Fires'', via Stone Barn Records. By 2006, he returned to his native Pennsylvania but continued to record. A duet album with Sundrud entitled ''Idlewheel'' was released that year, followed by ''Brother to the Wind'' in 2009.
