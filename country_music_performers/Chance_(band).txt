'''Chance''' was an American [[country music]] group composed of Jeff Barosh (vocals, fiddle, steel guitar, sax, guitar), Mick Barosh (drums), John Buckley (guitar), Jon Mulligan (keyboards), and Billy Hafer (bass). The group recorded one album for [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville]] in 1985 which included the Top 40 singles "To Be Lovers" and "She Told Me Yes." Previously known in the south Texas area as "Texas Pride", they changed their name to "Chance" after securing a record deal and gaining national recognition in the mid-1980s. Keyboard player Jon Mulligan was killed by a drunk driver in 1987 on the way home from one of the group's local Texas concerts. Keyboardist Clay Hemphill filled the duty on the keys from 1987 to 1993 during the transition years from "Chance" to "Jeff Chance". Bill Hafer retired in 1993 to pursue his custom flight case business, "Hafer Case". Bruce Repka joined the band in 1993 on keyboards & steel. Fred Rice (bass) came aboard but left a year later. Darrell Jozwiak filled the role of bass guitarist from 1994 until the band played their last gig together in October 1995.
