==Early life==
Born in [[Duncan, Oklahoma]], Axton spent his preteen years in [[Comanche, Oklahoma]], with his brother John.<ref name=axtonallm>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1512|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Hoyt Axton|last=Ankeny|first=Jason| publisher= AllMusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> His mother [[Mae Boren Axton]], a songwriter, cowrote the song "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", which became a major hit for [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Pareles>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/27/arts/hoyt-axton-61-songwriter-singer-and-actor-in-movies.html|title=Hoyt Axton, 61, Songwriter, Singer and Actor in Movies|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 1999|author=Pareles, Jon |url-access=limited}}</ref> Some of Hoyt's own songs were later recorded by Presley. Axton's father John Thomas Axton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/90/Hoyt-Axton.html|title=Hoyt Axton Biography (1938–)| website= filmreference.com}}</ref> was a naval officer stationed in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, where the family joined him in 1949.

Axton graduated from [[Robert E. Lee High School (Jacksonville, Florida)|Robert E. Lee High School]] in 1956 and left town after a hardware store was destroyed by fire on graduation night following a misguided prank.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://larrycohenproductions.com/N_Fla_Music.htm| title= North Florida Music Hall of Fame| first= Larry| last= Cohen| publisher= Larry Cohen Productions| access-date= January 5, 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170820124706/http://larrycohenproductions.com/N_Fla_Music.htm| archive-date= August 20, 2017}}</ref>

He attended [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]] on a scholarship,<ref name=Pareles /> where he played football, but he left to enlist in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. Axton held the rank of [[Petty officer second class|Petty Officer Second Class]] and served on two ships, the [[USS Princeton (CV-37)|USS ''Princeton'' (CV-37)]] and the [[USS Ranger (CV-61)|USS ''Ranger ''(CVA-61)]].<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

Axton was a cousin of musician [[Arlo Guthrie]]. He was also the first cousin of [[David Boren]], who served as governor of Oklahoma and three terms in the [[United States Senate]] and was also president of the [[University of Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=AX002|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|title=Axton, Mae Boren (1914–1997)|access-date=December 20, 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
After his discharge from the Navy, Axton began singing folk songs in coffee houses and nightclubs in Southern California. In the early 1960s, he released his first folk album, ''The Balladeer'' (recorded at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|the Troubadour]]), which included his song "Greenback Dollar." It became a 1963 hit for [[the Kingston Trio]].<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

Axton released numerous albums throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the mid-1970's he produced studio covers of his own music for [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]], and also produced ''Tales From the Ozone'', a 1975 album by [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]]. He released many minor hits of his own, such as "Boney Fingers", "When the Morning Comes" and 1979's "Della and the Dealer".<ref name=Pareles /> His vocal style featured his distinctive bass-baritone (which later deepened to near-bass) and use of [[characterization]].

Axton first appeared on television in a [[David L. Wolper]] ABC production of ''The Story of a Folksinger'' (1963). He appeared on ''[[Hootenanny (US TV series)|Hootenanny]]'', hosted by [[Jack Linkletter]], during this period. In 1965, he appeared in an episode of ''[[Bonanza]]''<ref name=Pareles /> in which he sang duets with [[Pernell Roberts]]. In 1966, he made his film debut in ''[[Smoky (1966 film)|Smoky]]'' playing the role of Fred Denton, the evil brother of the character played by [[Fess Parker]]. He gained fame in the 1970s and 1980s through his film roles, including those in ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979), ''[[Liar's Moon]]'' (1982), ''[[Heart Like a Wheel (film)|Heart Like a Wheel]]'' (1983) and ''[[Gremlins (film)|Gremlins]]'' (1984). His television appearances included ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' (1976), ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' (1976), ''[[WKRP In Cincinnati|WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' (1979) and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1984, 1985). In 1980, he sang the theme song to the short-lived series ''[[Flo (TV series)|Flo]]'', and guest-starred as himself in the episode titled "You Gotta Have Hoyt". Axton sang the jingle "The Ballad of Big Mac" for a 1969 [[McDonald's]] [[Big Mac]] television commercial as well as "Head for the Mountains" in voiceovers for [[Busch Beer|Busch]] beer in the 1980s. He appeared in a [[Pizza Hut]] commercial in 1985 and in a TV spot for [[Florists' Transworld Delivery|FTD]] with [[Merlin Olsen]] in 1989.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 1991 Axton was awarded an induction to The Walk of Western Stars in Newhall, California.

Axton's most lasting contributions, however, were songs made famous by others: "[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]" ([[Three Dog Night]]) and "[[Never Been to Spain]]" for both Three Dog Night and [[Elvis Presley]], "Greenback Dollar" for the Kingston Trio, "[[The Pusher]]" and "Snowblind Friend"  for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], "[[No No Song]]" for [[Ringo Starr]], and songs covered by singers such as [[Joan Baez]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[John Denver]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Martha Reeves]], [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Anne Murray]], [[David Clayton-Thomas]] and [[Colter Wall]]. Axton sang [[Duet (music)|duets]] with [[Linda Ronstadt]] on the songs "Lion in the Winter" and "[[When the Morning Comes (song)|When the Morning Comes]]", with Renee Armand on "Boney Fingers" and with [[Tanya Tucker]] on "You Taught Me How to Cry." His composition "Joy to the World", performed by Three Dog Night, reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for six straight weeks in 1971, making it the top hit of the year. He named his record label Jeremiah after the bullfrog mentioned in the song.<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

==Personal life==
Axton was married four times; his first three marriages ended in divorce.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> He had five children.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> One of his children, Matt Axton, is a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mattaxton.com| title=Matt Axton Music|access-date=February 5, 2024}}</ref>

Axton struggled with [[cocaine]] addiction, and several of his songs, including "The Pusher", "Snowblind Friend" and "No No Song", partly reflect his experiences with the drug.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> He was a proponent of medical marijuana use, but he and his wife Deborah were arrested in February 1997 at their Montana home for possession of about {{cvt|500|g|lb|abbr=on}} of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. His wife later explained that she offered Axton marijuana to relieve his pain and stress following his 1995 stroke. They were fined and received [[deferred sentence]]s. Axton never fully recovered from his stroke, and he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.{{fact|date=June 2024}}

==Death==
Axton died at age 61 at his home in [[Victor, Montana|Victor]], Montana on October 26, 1999, after suffering two heart attacks in two weeks.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/><ref name=axton2>{{cite news|title=Songwriter Hoyt Axton Dead at 61 In Montana| work= Daily News|location=New York |last= Hinckley| first= David| url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-10-27/news/18115330_1_greenback-dollar-hoyt-axton-boney-fingers| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120614052803/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-10-27/news/18115330_1_greenback-dollar-hoyt-axton-boney-fingers| url-status= dead| archive-date= June 14, 2012|date=October 27, 1999|access-date=September 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name=axton3>{{cite encyclopedia| title= Axton, Hoyt Wayne (1938–1999)| encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture| publisher= Oklahoma Historical Society| last= Burke| first= Brad| url= http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AX001.html| date= October 27, 1999| access-date= September 3, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110805103414/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AX001.html| archive-date= August 5, 2011}}</ref>
