He has recorded three studio albums: 1999's ''Love Trip'' on the [[Virgin Records]] label. 2007's ''Loaded & Empty'' and 2012's ''Telephone, TX'' were released on his personal Nic-Nic-Neer label.

In addition, Kilgore has written singles for [[Tracy Byrd]], [[John Michael Montgomery]] and [[Clay Walker]].

==Biography==
Kilgore got his start playing various bars throughout the [[Portland, Oregon]] area, subsequently moving to [[Mesa, Arizona]] and later to [[North Carolina]] before he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Eventually, he found a deal as a songwriter, and in 1995, [[Tracy Byrd]] entered Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] with "[[Love Lessons (song)|Love Lessons]]", which Kilgore co-wrote. Kilgore also signed to [[Asylum Records]] in 1997 but did not record anything for the label.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=April 19, 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA99|page=99|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}</ref> Kilgore revealed on Irish Country Music channel, Keep It Country TV, in an interview with Tommy Rosney that he did record an un-released album for Asylum Records that was produced by [[Randy Travis]] producer [[Kyle Lehning]]
In 1998, [[John Michael Montgomery]] also had a top 5 country hit with "[[Cover You in Kisses]]", another song co-written by Kilgore.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p374008|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Jerry Kilgore > Biography))) |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last=Ruhlman |first=William |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name="scene"/> A year later, Kilgore was signed to [[Virgin Records]] as a recording artist, becoming the first artist signed to the label's Nashville division.<ref name="scene">{{cite web |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/11-01-99/nash_music-industry.html |title=Back to Basics: Nashville label takes its time breaking traditional artist |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last=Keel |first=Beverly |date=November 1, 1999 |work=Nashville Scene}}</ref> His debut album ''Love Trip'' was released that year,<ref name="allmusic"/> and its title track was a Top 40 hit on the country charts in late 1999. The album's other two singles failed to make Top 40, and Kilgore was dropped from Virgin Nashville's roster in 2000. He co-wrote [[Clay Walker]]'s 2001 single "[[If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again]]".

In 2007 (''Loaded & Empty'') and 2012 (''Telephone, TX''), Kilgore released independent CDs on Nic-Nic-Neer Records, .
