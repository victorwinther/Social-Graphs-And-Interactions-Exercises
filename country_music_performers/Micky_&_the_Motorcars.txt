==Background==
[[File:Micky and the Motorcars blacksheep 2017 7872.jpg|thumb|Micky Braun 2017]]

The two founding members, Micky and Gary Braun, are the sons of [[outlaw country]] and western swing musician Muzzie Braun of [[Stanley, Idaho]], and the brothers of Cody Braun and Willy Braun of the [[Texas]]-based [[roots rock]] band [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly]]. Both were part of Muzzie Braun & the Little Braun Brothers band, but formed their own band after Cody and Willy left to form Reckless Kelly.<ref name="allmusic bio">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/micky-the-motorcars-mn0000123988/biography |title=Micky & the Motorcars |first= Steve|last= Leggett |work=AllMusic}}</ref> 

The band originated in Idaho. The other founding members were childhood friends Travis Hardy on [[Drum|drums]] and Mark McCoy on [[Bass guitar|bass]]. They moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas, where Joseph Deeb joined the band as their lead guitarist.<ref name="allmusic bio" /> The band has undergone a number of personnel changes since its founding. Mark McCoy left the band in 2011 and died in 2012 in a rafting accident.<ref name="the boot">{{cite web |url=https://theboot.com/micky-and-the-motorcars-hold-this-town-together/ |title=Micky and the Motorcars, 'Hold This Town Together' |work=The Boot|date= October 7, 2019 |first= Angela |last=Stefano}}</ref> 

The band currently consists of Micky Braun ([[acoustic guitar]], [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]]), Gary Braun (lead & [[harmony vocals]], guitars, [[mandolin]], [[harmonica]]), Pablo Trujillo ([[lead guitar]], [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]]), Andrew Carrell (bass), and Bobby Paugh (drums & percussion).

The band is also tied to the Texas music movement and, to a lesser extent, the [[Oklahoma]]-based Red Dirt music scene. Every year, the band, in conjunction with their brothers and fellow musicians in Reckless Kelly, host the Braun Brothers Reunion in Idaho to celebrate the music and different artists from the genre.
