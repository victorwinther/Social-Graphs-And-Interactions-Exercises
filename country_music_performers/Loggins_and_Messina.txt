'''Loggins and Messina''' was an American [[pop rock]] duo consisting of [[Kenny Loggins]] and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], who achieved major chart success during the early-mid 1970s. Among their well-known songs are "[[Danny's Song]]", "[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]", and "[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]". After selling more than 16 million records and becoming one of the leading musical duos of the 1970s,<ref name="Thibodeaux">"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi," by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> Loggins and Messina separated in 1976. Although Messina would find only limited popularity following the breakup, Loggins went on to achieve major chart success in the 1980s. In 2005 and again in 2009, Loggins and Messina reformed for tours in the United States.

==History==
===Initial career 1971–1976===
[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Poco (band)|Poco]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he met [[Kenny Loggins]], a little-known singer/songwriter and guitarist who was signed to [[ABC-Dunhill]] as a staff songwriter.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=766}}</ref>

The two recorded a number of Loggins' compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins to a six-album contract (with the assistance of Messina), recording began in earnest for Loggins' debut album, with Messina as producer. Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. However, by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album – in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation, and vocals – that an "accidental" duo was born.

Their debut album was released November 1971 as ''Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina [[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored "[[Vahevala]]" (or "Vahevella" or "Vaheevella"), found top 3 success on Chicago's [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on May 18, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL - all hit music in the Midwest|publisher=Oldiesloon.com|date=May 18, 1972|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref> "Vahevala" and "Nobody But You" both reached the [[Hot 100]]. Although at first the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually gained traction by autumn 1972, particularly on college campuses, where the pair toured heavily. Loggins' and Messina's harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity unto itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of just continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo: Loggins and Messina.<ref name="Larkin"/>

On March 3, 1973, Loggins and Messina played Carnegie Hall. Ian Dove in the ''New York Times'' called it a "near-perfect rock 'n' roll concert".<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 3, 1973|title=LOGGINS AND MESSINA PLAY CARNEGIE ROCK (Published 1973)|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/03/archives/loggins-and-messina-play-carnegie-rock.html|access-date=March 13, 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

"When our first album, ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]'', came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales," Messina recalled in 2005. "We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that, and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, 'You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest.' He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one."<ref name="Thibodeaux" />

Messina assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning old friends, bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante, formerly of [[The Sunshine Company]], multireedist [[Jon Clarke (musician)|Jon Clarke]], and violinist/multireedist Al Garth. Famed [[Grammy]]-winning keyboardist, songwriter and record producer [[Michael Omartian]] played keyboards on the [[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|debut]], [[Loggins and Messina (album)|second]] and [[Full Sail (Loggins and Messina album)|third]] albums, but did not join them on tour. Los Angeles–based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]] played on all of the duo's studio albums, but like Omartian, he did not tour with them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's 'Vahevala' |publisher=Mixonline |date=September 1, 2004 |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

Over the next four years, from 1972 to 1976, they produced four more studio albums of original material, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material (''[[So Fine (Loggins and Messina album)|So Fine]]''), and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Hall & Oates]].<ref name="Thibodeaux" /> They charted three top 20 singles from the second and third albums: "[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]" (No. 4), "[[Thinking of You (Loggins and Messina song)|Thinking of You]]" (No. 18), and "[[My Music (song)|My Music]]" (No. 16). Their work was covered by other prominent artists, including [[Lynn Anderson]], who recorded "[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]" in 1972 and reached No. 3 on the charts, and [[Anne Murray]], who reached the U.S. top ten with "[[Danny's Song]]" in early 1973 and the U.S. top twenty with "[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]" in early 1974. The later studio albums, ''[[Mother Lode (album)|Mother Lode]]'' (1974), ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'' (1976), often found both Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record rather than as a genuine partnership. As both Loggins and Messina noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition.

Never really a team of true equals because of the initial teacher–apprentice nature of their music experience levels, the pair had quietly, amicably parted in 1976. Their final studio album of original material, ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'', was released January 1976. Later that year the duo went on a final tour, <ref name="Larkin"/> though prior to the start of the tour, Loggins accidentally cut his hand with a [[craft knife]] while practicing his wood-carving hobby at home which required surgery, thereby preventing him from playing guitar for most of that final tour. The final two concert dates of Loggins & Messina - as a duo - were in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, at the [[Neil S. Blaisdell Center]], on September 24 and 25, 1976, upon which the duo then parted to embark on solo careers. Messina found solo success elusive, but Loggins went on to become one of the biggest hitmakers of the 1980s.

A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released in November 1976, two months after the duo had ended.  In January 1977, a second live album (from concerts in 1975 and 1976), ''[[Finale (album)|Finale]]'', was released, more by record company decision than one intended by the artists.

===Reformation===
The two reunited in 2005 to choose tracks for an expanded compilation album of singles and album cuts ''[[The Best: Sittin' In Again]]'', which proved successful enough for them to embark on tour together. Their successful "Sittin' In Again" tour was launched in mid-2005 and played-out the remainder of the year. They also released an album that year of the tour. "Every couple of years we'd talk about it, but I was having too much fun as a solo artist," Loggins said that summer. "It was very rewarding for me, and I wasn't ready to share the reins. I still had a lot of stuff to do on my own, to prove myself and to express myself, in a way that wouldn't have fit in with Loggins and Messina."<ref name="Thibodeaux" />

The two were pleased enough to consider future Loggins and Messina projects and the two also toured in 2009. "Like most relationships, we were a moment in time," Loggins said. "It's just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men, in a way we never really did back then. We were young and competitive and didn't realize that it wasn't necessarily all about getting your way, but you learn that if you grow up."<ref name="Thibodeaux" />

Their backing band changed from album to album, with the core members listed below. Some albums featured backing members who later were well-known in their own right; [[John Townsend (artist)|John Townsend]] and [[Ed Sanford]], later of the [[Sanford-Townsend Band]] ("[[Smoke from a Distant Fire]]"), contributed vocals and songwriting to the ''Native Sons'', their final studio album.
