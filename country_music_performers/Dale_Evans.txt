'''Dale Evans Rogers''' (born '''Frances Octavia Smith'''; October 31, 1912 – February 7, 2001) was an American actress, singer, and songwriter. She was the third wife of [[singing cowboy]] film star [[Roy Rogers]].

==Early life==
[[File:Dale Evans Original Home.jpg|thumb|Evans' childhood home in Uvalde, TX]]
Evans was born Frances Octavia Smith on October 31, 1912, in [[Uvalde, Texas]], to Bettie Sue Wood and T. Hillman Smith.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Raymond E. |date=2005 |title=King of the Cowboys, Queen of the West: Roy Rogers and Dale Evans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IZ_-YerLt0C&pg=PA4 |location=Madison, WI |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=4 |isbn=978-0-2992-1004-5 |via=[[Google Books]] |ref={{sfnRef|White}}}}</ref>{{efn|For unknown reasons, the doctor who attended the birth recorded the baby's name as Lucille Wood Smith, a fact of which she was unaware until the 1950s, when she needed a copy of her birth certificate in order to obtain a passport.{{sfn|White|page=4}}}} She had a tumultuous early life. She spent a lot of time living with her uncle, Dr. L.D. Massey MD FACP, an internal medicine physician, in [[Osceola, Arkansas]]. At age 14, she eloped with and married Thomas F. Fox, with whom she had one son, Thomas F. Fox Jr., when she was 15. A year later, abandoned by her husband, she found herself in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], a single parent pursuing a career in music.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller Davis|first1=Elise|title=The Answer is God|url=https://archive.org/details/answerisgodinspi00davi|url-access=registration|date=1955|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Co.|location=New York|lccn=55009539|pages=[https://archive.org/details/answerisgodinspi00davi/page/59 59–62]|edition=First}}</ref> She landed jobs with Memphis radio stations (WMC and WREC), singing and playing piano. Divorced in 1929, she took the name Dale Evans while working at radio station [[WHAS (AM)|WHAS]] ([[Louisville, Kentucky]]) in the early 1930s after the station manager suggested it because he believed she could promote her singing career with a short pleasant sounding name that announcers and disc jockeys could easily pronounce.<ref name="bio">[http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html Dale Evans' biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217214053/http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html |date=February 17, 2008 }}, royrogers.com; accessed May 16, 2014.</ref>

==Early career==

After beginning her career singing at the radio station where she was employed as a secretary, Evans had a productive career as a [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]], and [[big band]] singer that led to a screen test and contract with [[20th Century Fox]] studios. She gained exposure on radio as the featured singer for a time on the [[Edgar Bergen]]/[[Charlie McCarthy]] show.

Throughout this early period, Evans went through two additional failed marriages, first with August Wayne Johns from 1929 to 1935; then with accompanist and arranger Robert Dale Butts from 1937 to 1946. Neither marriage produced children. During her time at [[20th Century Fox]], the studio promoted her as the unmarried supporter of her teenage "brother" Tommy (actually her son Tom Fox, Jr.), a deception that continued through her divorce from Butts in 1946 and her development as a cowgirl co-star to [[Roy Rogers]] at [[Republic Studios]].<ref name="biodata"/>

==Joint efforts==
Evans married [[Roy Rogers]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1947 at the Flying L Ranch in [[Davis, Oklahoma]], where they had earlier filmed the movie ''[[Home in Oklahoma]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.happytrailsforever.com/view/?pageID=151254 |title=Happy Trails Forever – Honoring the *King of the Cowboys* & *Queen of the West*, Roy Rogers & Dale Evans – Their Story<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=February 6, 2008 |archive-date=March 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306031242/http://www.happytrailsforever.com/view/?pageID=151254 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The successful marriage was Rogers' third and Evans' fourth; the two were a team on- and off-screen from 1946 until Rogers' death in 1998. Shortly after the wedding, Evans ended the deception regarding her son Tommy. Roy had an adopted daughter, Cheryl, and two biological children, Linda and Roy Jr. (Dusty), from his second marriage. Together they had one child, Robin Elizabeth, who died of complications of [[Down syndrome]] shortly before her second birthday. Her life inspired Evans to write her bestseller ''Angel Unaware''. Evans was very influential in changing public perceptions of children with developmental disabilities and served as a role model for many parents. After she wrote ''Angel Unaware'', a group then known as the “Oklahoma County Council for Mentally Retarded Children” adopted its better-known name [[Dale Rogers Training Center]] in her honor. She went on to write a number of religious and inspirational books, and she and Roy appeared many times with [[Billy Graham]] in Crusades all over the country, singing gospel songs and giving their testimony.<ref name="biodata">{{cite web|url=http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html|title=Dale Evans Biography|publisher=The Roy Rogers – Dale Evans Museum|access-date=2008-02-05|archive-date=February 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217214053/http://www.royrogers.com/dale_evans_bio.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Evans and Rogers adopted four other children: Mimi, Dodie, Sandy, and Debbie.<ref name=Roy>{{cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|title=Roy Rogers, 'King of the Cowboys' Dies|date=July 7, 1998|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jul-07-mn-1427-story.html|author=Staff}}</ref>

From 1951 to 1957, Evans and Rogers starred in the highly-successful television series ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]'', in which they continued their cowboy and cowgirl roles, with her riding her trusty [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]] horse, [[Buttermilk (horse)|Buttermilk]]. In addition to her successful TV shows, more than 30 films and some 200 songs, Evans wrote the song "[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]".<ref name="ReferenceA">{{IMDb name|id=0262661|name=Dale Evans}}</ref> In later episodes of the program, she was outspoken in her [[Christianity]], telling people that God would assist them with their troubles and imploring adults and children to turn to Him for guidance. In late 1962, the couple co-hosted a comedy-western-variety program, ''[[The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show]]''.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1964, Evans spoke at a "Project Prayer" rally attended by 2,500 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The gathering, which was hosted by actor [[Anthony Eisley]], star of ABC's ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'' series, sought to flood the [[United States Congress]] with letters in support of mandatory [[school prayer]], following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the [[United States Supreme Court]] which struck down mandatory prayer as conflicting with the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=pearson>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf|title=The Washington Merry-Go-Round|author=Drew Pearson|date=May 14, 1964|publisher=dspace.wrlc.org|access-date=January 13, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116232324/http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf|archive-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref>

Joining Evans and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were [[Walter Brennan]], [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Rhonda Fleming]], [[Pat Boone]], and [[Gloria Swanson]]. Evans declared, "It's high time that all America stood up to be counted. Let our children learn of the Lord and be free." Eisley and Fleming added that Rogers, [[John Wayne]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and [[Pat Buttram]] would have attended the rally had their schedules permitted.<ref name=pearson/> In the 1970s, Evans recorded several solo albums of religious music. During the 1980s, the couple introduced their films weekly on the former [[The Nashville Network]]. In the 1990s, Evans hosted her own religious television program.
