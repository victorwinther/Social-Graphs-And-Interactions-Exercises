In an interview with ''Sounds Like Nashville'', she recounted spending a lot of time outdoors with her family during childhood.<ref name="Sounds Like Nashville">{{cite news |last1=Vaughn |first1=Grace Lenehan |title=Get to Know: Priscilla Block [Exclusive Interview] |url=https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/get-to-know-priscilla-block/ |access-date=23 December 2021 |work=Sounds Like Nashville |date=May 6, 2021}}</ref> From an early age she had aspirations of becoming a country artist. "I was gonna move to Nashville and chase this dream, and everybody looked at me like I was crazy," she told ''Songwriter Universe''.<ref name="Songwriter Universe">{{cite magazine |last1=Kawashima |first1=Dale |title=Rising Country Artist Priscilla Block Talks About Her Debut Hit "Just About Over You," Her EP And Her Songwriting |magazine=Songwriter Universe |date=November 22, 2021 |url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/priscilla-block-interview-2021.htm |access-date=23 December 2021}}</ref> She also learned to play the [[guitar]] at an early age.<ref>{{cite web |title=Priscilla Block |url=https://www.opry.com/artists/priscilla-block/ |website=[[Grand Ole Opry]] |access-date=25 December 2021}}</ref> Block began performing in [[North Carolina]], including the Deep South Bar in Raleigh.<ref name="5 Things">{{cite web |last1=Carr |first1=Courtney |title=Who Is Priscilla Block? 5 Things You Need to Know |url=https://theboot.com/who-is-priscilla-block/ |website=The Boot |date=3 March 2021 |access-date=23 December 2021}}</ref> In 2014, she moved to Nashville and to fulfill her goals in the country music industry.<ref name="Songwriter Universe"/>

Block worked a variety of odd jobs to make a living.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> During her early years in Nashville, she was unhappy and considered moving home. One day, she had a chance encounter with [[Taylor Swift]] while walking down a Nashville road. Swift pulled her car over and invited Block inside. "That was truly the day that I decided that I really needed to give music a fair shot and do this thing," she commented.<ref name="Sounds Like Nashville" />

==Career==
Block began her country music career by co-writing songs with other people. She also would "sit for hours" watching Nashville artists perform.<ref name="Sounds Like Nashville"/> She also played several popular Nashville bars including the Listening Room Cafe and Whiskey Jam.<ref name="Music Row">{{cite magazine |last1=Cantrell |first1=LB |title=Priscilla Block Talks TikTok, Signing With UMG, And Writing What She Knows |magazine=Music Row |date=October 2, 2020 |url=https://musicrow.com/2020/10/priscilla-block-talks-tiktok-signing-with-umg-and-writing-what-she-knows1/ |access-date=23 December 2021}}</ref> In 2017, Block released her debut [[extended play]] (EP) titled ''Different Route''. The project was recorded in a closet studio by a producer whom Block asked to help her cut her own material.<ref name="Songwriter Universe"/> Between 2016 and 2020, she released several songs focused around self-love and acceptance. Penned by Block herself, these tracks included "Thick Thighs" and "PMS".<ref name="allmusicbio"/> Many of these recordings appeared on the social media platform [[TikTok]].

Block began releasing music on the app during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. "I started posting original music and those videos started doing really, really well. It was interesting because I would post cover videos and then I would post my own videos and my own original music was kind of what was working," she explained.<ref name="Sounds Like Nashville" />

After running into an ex-lover in 2020, Block composed the song "[[Just About Over You]]". She posted herself singing the song live on TikTok<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite magazine |last1=Hissong |first1=Samantha |title=A Country Song Rode the TikTok Train to Number One in 12 Hours |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 6, 2020 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/priscilla-block-country-song-number-one-tiktok-1040532/ |access-date=23 December 2021}}</ref> and the video went [[Viral video|viral]].<ref name="Songwriter Universe" /><ref name="Sounds Like Nashville" /> A fan of her music in [[California]] created a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to get it recorded.

Ultimately, Block chose to sign with [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville]]. The label issued "Just About Over You" shortly after her 2020 signing.<ref name="People" /> Mercury then released a radio edit of "Just About Over You", which was produced by [[Ross Copperman]].<ref name="Music Row" /> Months later, Block filmed a [[music video]] for the song, directed by Logen Christopher.<ref name="Video">{{cite web | url=https://www.soundslikenashville.com/music/priscilla-block-just-about-over-you-video/ | title=Priscilla Block Tells the True Tale of a Ruined Night in 'Just About Over You' | work=Sounds Like Nashville | date=November 13, 2020 | access-date=February 13, 2021}}</ref> It peaked at number 81 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name="Hot 100"/> and became a top 20 hit single on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Hollabaugh |first1=Lorie |title=Priscilla Block To Embark On 'Welcome To The Block Party Tour' |magazine=Music Row |date=February 3, 2022 |url=https://musicrow.com/2022/02/priscilla-block-to-embark-on-welcome-to-the-block-party-tour/ |access-date=26 February 2022}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Block's musical style blends country music with [[Pop music|pop]] and [[southern rock]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref name="5 Things"/> Writer James Christopher Monger described Block as, "a country-pop artist who found success in 2020 with a string of relatable singles that effectively paired earworm melodies with unfiltered lyrics."<ref name="allmusicbio"/> According to Block, she does not "commit to one sound or genre of music". "It's a little sass, a little trash and a little sad," she commented.<ref name="5 Things"/> She has cited [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Luke Combs]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Chris Stapleton]] as musical influences.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dukes |first1=Billy |title=Priscilla Block Says Kelly Clarkson Changed Her Life |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/priscilla-block-kelly-clarkson-influence-interview/ |website=[[Taste of Country]] |date=9 February 2022 |access-date=16 April 2022}}</ref>
