'''Marcel Francois Chagnon''' (born February 9, 1975), known professionally as '''Marcel''', is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and music video director. Signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2003, he released his debut album ''You, Me, and the Windshield'' that year and charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts with the single "Country Rock Star". Five years later, he signed to [[Lyric Street Records]] and released the single "I Love This Song", which has also charted. In addition to his recording career, Marcel has directed several music videos, and has written charted singles for [[Josh Gracin]], [[Trace Adkins]], and [[Jessica Andrews]], to whom he is married.

== Career ==
Born in [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan]], Marcel was a [[semi-professional sports|semi-pro]] [[ice hockey|hockey]] player until signing with [[Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2002.<ref name="gac"/><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p559061/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Marcel biography |accessdate=2008-07-25 |last=Kergan |first=Wade |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> For four years prior to this, while waiting for an opportunity, he sang at clubs, bars, and waited tables for extra money.

In 2003, he released his debut album ''[[You, Me and the Windshield]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> The tracks "Country Rock Star" and "Tennessee" from this album were released as singles. After this he returned to writing songs for other artists.

Marcel has co-written two of [[Josh Gracin]]'s singles: "[[Nothin' to Lose (Josh Gracin song)|Nothin' to Lose]]", which previously appeared on ''You, Me and the Windshield'', and "[[Favorite State of Mind]]". [[Jessica Andrews]] also released two of his songs as singles: "[[There's More to Me Than You]]" and "Everything". [[Rascal Flatts]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], and [[Big & Rich]] have also recorded his songs.<ref name="gac"/>

In 2008, Marcel signed to [[Lyric Street Records]], releasing his third single, "I Love This Song" that year.<ref name="gac"/> When the song failed to reach Top 40, he exited Lyric Street's roster. In February 2009, he signed to the Red Stripe Plane label. He had a cameo in ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'', playing guitar in [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]' band. He is also shown in Cyrus' video for "[[Back to Tennessee (song)|Back to Tennessee]]".

On February 17, 2009, Marcel released his fourth single, "Believin'", which is also the title track to his second album. The album was released on the Red Stripe Plane label, but neither the album or single charted on any ''Billboard'' chart.  In June 2010, Marcel released a new single titled "It's Summertime." Later in the year, Marcel began directing [[music video]]s for other artists.

==Personal life==
Marcel became engaged to [[Jessica Andrews]] in October 2010, and the two were married on November 11, 2011.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120107213345/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1676414/top-10-country-newlyweds-of-the-year.jhtml CMT.com story on 2011 weddings]</ref> Andrews gave birth to the couple's son [[Rockwell Francois Chagnon]] on February 6, 2018.
