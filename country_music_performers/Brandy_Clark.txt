==Early life==
Brandy Clark was born in [[Morton, Washington]], a logging town of 900 people in the shadow of [[Mount Rainier]]. As a child in the 1980s she was influenced by the country-pop and traditional country music artists she heard her parents and grandmother play, like Barbara Mandrell, Ronnie Milsap, Merle Haggard and Loretta Lynn. Clark cites the [[Patsy Cline]] movie "[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]" as one of her biggest early influences.<ref name="CMT Edge Article">[https://archive.today/20130722191138/http://m.cmt.com/edge/post.rbml?id=2013/06/07/brandy-clark-sees-life-as-a-dark-comedy/&nbck=999-001-001 CMT Edge Article] (June 7, 2013).

Clark began playing guitar at nine years old and sang in school musicals, also writing songs. She obtained a basketball scholarship at [[Central Washington University]], but later moved back home, obtaining an associate degree from a community college. Still a teenager, she joined the music business program at [[Belmont University]], and moved to Nashville in 1998.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} 
At Belmont she took guitar lessons again and joined a band with her mother and a friend. She studied commercial music and was chosen to perform in the school's "Best of the Best Showcase". Upon graduation, Clark got a job with Leadership Music which led to her eventual publishing deal. {{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

==Music career==
In 2011 "[[Mama's Broken Heart]]", written by Clark with [[Shane McAnally]] (her frequent collaborator) and [[Kacey Musgraves]], appeared on Miranda Lambert's album ''[[Four the Record]]''. It was released on January 14, 2013, as the fourth single reaching No. 2 on both the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and Country Airplay charts. Clark's biggest success to date was as the co-writer along with McAnally and Trevor Rosen when she celebrated a No.1 song [[ASCAP]] Party at an industry gathering for The Band Perry's third No. 1 hit, "[[Better Dig Two]]".<ref name="Music Row Article">[http://www.musicrow.com/2013/03/no-1-party-the-band-perrys-better-dig-two/ MusicRow.com] (March 7, 2013). Retrieved July 22, 2013.</ref>

As a [[Music Row]] songwriter Clark writes songs that are mostly about the seedy underbelly of country folk. They are observational pieces based on flawed characters that tell the truth on the human condition. They contain [[Black comedy|dark humor]], with a blend of wit and realism, while having the artistic license to make them fictional.<ref name="The Song Survives Article">[http://www.thesongsurvives.com/2013/01/brandy-clark-pray-to-jesus/ The Song Survives Article].
