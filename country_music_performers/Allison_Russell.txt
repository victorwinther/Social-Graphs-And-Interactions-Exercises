== Personal life ==
In 2013, Russell married her Birds of Chicago bandmate Jeremy Lindsay (stage name JT Nero).<ref>{{cite web |title=Jeremy Lindsay |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1290445-Jeremy-Lindsay |website=discogs |access-date=1 December 2021}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dickinson |first=Chrissie |title=Birds of Chicago a family thing, on and off stage |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-birds-of-chicago-jt-nero-allison-russell-20141023-story.html |access-date=2021-10-26 |website=chicagotribune.com |date=October 23, 2014}}</ref> They were close friends and housemates.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hight |first=Jewly |date=2021-01-20 |title=Roots Music Roomies Allison Russell And Yola Worked To Get Somewhere In A Year of Staying Put |url=https://wnxp.org/roots-music-roomies-allison-russell-and-yola-really-got-somewhere-in-a-year-of-staying-put/ |access-date=2021-10-26 |website=WNXP |language=en-US}}</ref> Russell gave birth to their daughter, Ida, in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-birds-of-chicago-jt-nero-allison-russell-20141023-story.html |title=Birds of Chicago a family thing, on and off stage |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=October 23, 2014}}</ref>

Russell identifies as [[queer]] and stated in an interview that "I fall in the middle of the spectrum of orientation. I’ve been in love with women and I’ve been in love with men and I’ve been in love with trans people and I’ve been in love with non-binary people. I wound up falling in love and committing to share a life with a man, my husband. One could assume that I’m straight, but I am not and especially in this time of increased polarization and bigotry, it is really important that people understand that nothing is black and white. Nothing is simple and you can’t assume that because I am married to a man and I have a child that I am a straight person. You can’t say homophobic things to me and have it pass. Part of me wanted to really acknowledge that publicly". She stated that "Persephone", a song from her debut album, was written about her first love, a woman she met during her teenage years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/allison-russell-gives-a-voice-to-the-abused-and-queer-on-solo-debut-part-1-of-2/ |title=Allison Russell Gives a Voice to Queer Folks and Survivors on Solo Debut (Part 1 of 2) |date=19 May 2021}}</ref>

In 2023, she told ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' that she was a "hopeful [[agnostic]]," adding that she believed that "empathy is a superpower and that diversity is not a dirty word" and said she "resist[s] the divide-and-conquer tactics of all toxic hierarchies...Our differences are riches...Our rainbow coalition is unstoppable."<ref name="rude2023russell">{{cite web |last=Rude |first=Mey |url=https://www.out.com/out100/disruptors/allisonrussell |title=Allison Russell |website=[[Out (magazine)|Out]] |access-date=November 20, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231105215952/https://www.out.com/out100/disruptors/allisonrussell |archive-date=November 5, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref>
