Signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2006, Nichols made his debut that year with the release of his single "Unbroken Ground", which reached No.&nbsp;39 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Following it were the singles "I Can't Love You Anymore" and "Goin' Fast." Nichols never released an album for the label and soon left it.

In April 2010, he replaced [[Chris Stapleton]] as the lead singer and guitarist of [[The SteelDrivers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=3958|title=Gary Nichols named SteelDrivers' new singer|date=April 2, 2010|work=[[Country Standard Time]]|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

After seven successful years and leading the band to win its first Grammy, Gary departed in August 2017. He released a solo album titled "Field Of Plenty" on Merrimack Records the same year. The mostly solo album features [[Charlie Musselwhite]] and [[Spooner Oldham]] on some tracks.<ref name="Music Connection">{{cite web |url=https://www.musicconnection.com/music-album-review-gary-nichols-field-plenty-1010/ |title=Album Review – Gary Nichols "Field Of Plenty" (10/10) |accessdate=June 14, 2019 |author=Eric Harabadian}}</ref>
