===1970s===
In the 1970s, Stevens became a producer and studio musician in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He recorded songs for [[Barnaby Records]] and [[Warner Brothers]] during 1970–79. Stevens' biggest hit in the U.S. was his gospel-inflected single "[[Everything Is Beautiful]]" (1970). It won a [[Grammy Award]], was the theme song for his summer 1970 TV show, a number one hit on both the pop and Adult-Contemporary charts, and marked his first time in the Top 40 on the country charts, peaking at number 39. The single sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year=1978| title=The Book of Golden Discs| edition=2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/286 286]| isbn=978-0-2142-0512-5| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/286}}</ref>

Stevens had a transatlantic chart-topping hit in 1974 with "[[The Streak (song)|The Streak]]," a novelty song about [[streaking]] that reached number one on the American and British singles charts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bronson |first1=Fred |title=The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits |date=2003 |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2 |page=365 |edition=updated and expanded 5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=%22ray+stevens%22+%22the+streak%22&pg=PT374 |accessdate=2018-07-08}}</ref><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first=David| last=Roberts| year=2006| title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]| edition=19th| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited| location=London| isbn=978-1-9049-9410-7| page=301}}</ref>

Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, with some exceptions (such as "[[Shriner's Convention (song)|Shriner's Convention]]" in 1981), Stevens focused mostly on serious material, as he felt that the novelty song was becoming less popular in the era.<ref name=nutsoversquirrel>{{cite magazine| date=December 8, 1984| title=Stevens Nuts over 'Squirrel'| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| pages=39, 42| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22mississippi+squirrel+revival%22&pg=RA1-PA39}}</ref> Stevens had an adult contemporary crossover hit in 1979 with "[[I Need Your Help Barry Manilow]]," a cut from Stevens's [[Barry Manilow]] tribute/parody album ''[[The Feeling's Not Right Again]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/adult-contemporary/1979-04-28| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105210838/http://www.billboard.com/charts/adult-contemporary/1979-04-28| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 5, 2016| title=Adult Contemporary Chart| magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

===1980s===
Stevens then joined MCA in 1984. Feeling that novelty songs were becoming popular again, he authorized the rush release of "[[Mississippi Squirrel Revival]]" in 1984, which reached the country top 20.<ref name=nutsoversquirrel/> In 1985, Stevens performed at the [[Lanierland Music Park]] in Georgia with Pinkard & Bowden.<ref name="Inc.1985">{{cite magazine| title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts| magazine=Billboard| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48| date=June 1, 1985| page=48| issn=0006-2510}}</ref>
