==Biography==

===Early life and music===
Carolyn Dawn Johnson was born in [[Grande Prairie]], Alberta to John Johnson, a farmer and operator of a seed-cleaning business, and Loretta Johnson, a supervisor of a home for senior citizens. Johnson was raised on a farm in [[Deadwood, Alberta]] with two brothers, late older brother Derwin, who died due to an undisclosed illness on Christmas Eve in 1998, and brother Greg.

Johnson was passionate about music from a young age and even asked her mother how anyone could live without it.<ref name="rca">{{cite web

The family later moved to [[Westlock, Alberta]] and Johnson attended RF Staples High School there. During her high school years, she learned to play the clarinet, flute and saxophone. She kept up her piano lessons largely in part due to Thiessan sending books and encouraging letters to her.<ref name="elm"/> Her high school teachers were not as encouraging and caused her to turn away from music for a while and turn to science, a period in her life which she called "a stain in her heart".<ref name="yam">{{cite web

After graduating high school, believing that she could not make a living as a musician, Johnson attended [[Trinity Western University]] in [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]], British Columbia studying biology and a year later she was in [[Edmonton]], Alberta studying education.<ref name="elm"/> During her college years, she frequently sat-in with local bands at night and encouragement from them caused her to think that maybe she could have a career in the music industry.

}}</ref> Johnson focussed on songwriting in her spare time and ordered a video featuring songwriters from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to learn more about songwriting and through this video, she joined the Nashville Songwriters Association International.<ref name="cmtbio"/>
In 1994, Johnson headed to Nashville after calling her mother and saying, "I'm going big. I'm going for the big picture."<ref name="elm"/>

===Songwriting career===
In Nashville, Johnson attended songwriting workshops and writer's night events. In 1997, Johnson moved permanently to Nashville after obtaining a work visa and later that year, she signed with Patrick Joseph Music as a songwriter.<ref name="rca"/> Her songwriting demos captured the attention of many record label executives and some of the songs she wrote were recorded by [[Patty Loveless]], [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Mindy McCready]], [[Jo Dee Messina]], [[Linda Davis]] and [[Chely Wright]]. Johnson's breakthrough as a songwriter came in 1999 when "[[Single White Female (song)|Single White Female]]", a song she co-wrote with Shaye Smith and recorded by Wright, became a number one hit on country radio. This song became Johnson's first number one hit as a songwriter. Another one of her songs, "Downtime", recorded by Messina, also became a top five hit. In 2000, Johnson was named "Breakthrough Songwriter of the Year" by [[MusicRow]] Magazine.

===Singing and recording career===
In 1999, Johnson started her career as a solo artist. Her success as a songwriter led her to a record deal with the [[Arista Records|Arista Nashville]] record label.  [[Paul Worley]], a producer with whom Johnson was working, was also working with [[Martina McBride]] at that time and asked Johnson to sing background vocals on McBride's songs.<ref name="swu"/> McBride subsequently invited Johnson to go on tour with her as a backup singer and guitarist. Johnson toured with McBride for over a year and during this time she was also hard at work writing songs for her debut album.<ref name="swu"/>

===''Room with a View''===
In 2001, Johnson went on the Girls Night Out Tour opening for high-profile stars [[Sara Evans]], Martina McBride, [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Jamie O'Neal]]. Later that year, Johnson released her debut album ''[[Room with a View (album)|Room with a View]]'' in Canada. She co-wrote all 13 songs and co-produced the album. An American release of the album followed a few months later, though only containing the first 11 songs due to differences in the contracts.<ref name="canoe1">{{cite web
