Decker began singing when she was two. She won her first talent contest in [[Baker, Louisiana]], at age nine, singing "[[I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart]]". By then, she had already been writing songs on a plastic guitar and had performed at [[SeaWorld]] and in [[Warner Robins, Georgia]] in 2000. At age fifteen, she made weekly trips to Nashville to hone her songwriting skills.

==Career==
=== Music ===
At seventeen, Decker was introduced to Carla Wallace of independent label Big Yellow Dog Music, who helped her with her songwriting and singing. One of her songs, "Gypsy Girl", was written with two writers from Yellow Dog and made it into the hands of record executive [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]], who brought her to the attention of [[L.A. Reid]]. She auditioned for Reid by singing her song "My Cowboy", produced by [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]]. Decker soon signed a contract with [[Mercury Records]].<ref name=billboard>{{cite magazine |first=Alisa |last=Kolenovic|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268369/jessie-james |title=Jessie James |magazine=Billboard |date=June 15, 2009 |access-date=July 6, 2014}}</ref>

Even though she originally thought that she would be producing a country record, Decker was later told to record a pop album by record executives.<ref name=rough/> She also claimed to have been asked to sound like pop singer [[Britney Spears]].<ref name=cmt>{{cite web|first=Chris |last=Parton |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1680698/jessie-james-reloads-for-another-shot-in-country.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311065806/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1680698/jessie-james-reloads-for-another-shot-in-country.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |title=Jessie James Reloads for Another Shot in Country |publisher=CMT |date=March 7, 2012 |access-date=March 26, 2012}}</ref> She described the recording process as "intense" due to the genre crossing.<ref name=rough>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Bjorke |url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/new-artist-spotlight-meet-jessie-james |title=New Artist Spotlight: Meet Jessie James |publisher=Roughstock.com |access-date=March 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413211427/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/new-artist-spotlight-meet-jessie-james |archive-date=April 13, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> She described herself in an interview as "a country girl at heart," having grown up listening to this music.<ref name=beatweek/>

Her debut album, ''Jessie James'', was released in August 2009, debuting at number 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was a fusion between country and pop music, with more emphasis placed on the latter as dictated by her label. The album also featured writing credits from Decker and seasoned pop songwriter [[Kara DioGuardi]] and [[Mitch Allan]], among others.<ref name=beatweek>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatweek.com/music/musicianinterviews/7003-jessie-james-interview/ |title=Jessie James interview |work=Beatweek |date=September 7, 2010 |access-date=October 14, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The album received mixed receptions from critics. [[Allmusic]] received the album positively, but found that despite being marketed as such and featuring some country-influenced production, the music on the album was a far cry from country music.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r1612463/review |title=Jessie James – Jessie James |website=AllMusic |date=August 11, 2009 |access-date=March 26, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]'' thought that the album only superficially pulled together influences from pop, country and hip-hop while failing to pander to any of those audiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/jessie-james-jessie-james/1802 |title=Jessie James: Jessie James &#124; Music Review |work=Slant Magazine |date=August 10, 2009 |access-date=March 26, 2012}}</ref> The album's first single, "[[Wanted (Jessie James song)|Wanted]]", produced by Allan, had been released in April and peaked at number 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Decker later performed in the Middle East with singer [[Kid Rock]] and comedian [[Carlos Mencia]] for US troops stationed overseas.<ref name=bio/>

Decker began working on her second album, ''Sweet American Dreams'',<ref name=title/> in 2010, which was initially planned to be released in late summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatweek.com/news/6760-jessie-james-reveals-new-album-title-daughter-of-a-gypsy/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730001917/http://www.beatweek.com/news/6760-jessie-james-reveals-new-album-title-daughter-of-a-gypsy/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 30, 2012 |title=Jessie James reveals new album title: Daughter of a Gypsy |work=Beatweek |date=July 16, 2010 |access-date=October 14, 2011 }}</ref> The album was to have the same country-pop sound as her debut, with Decker being given more leeway by Mercury in incorporating country sounds.<ref name=beatweek/> The first single, "Boys in the Summer", released in June, was a minor country success but failed to chart on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Having struggled with accepting her career path as a pop singer, Decker told her label in the midst of preparations for her album that she did not want to be a pop artist and wanted to record country music.<ref name=cmt/> After negotiations, Massey asked Mark Wright from [[Show Dog-Universal Music]], which had facilitated the country release of "Boys in the Summer" in November, to help Mercury/IDJ launch Decker in the country genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/nashville-iq/archive/12336/headline-of-the-day---january-18-2012 |title=Headline of the Day – January 18, 2012|website=Allaccess.com |date=January 18, 2012 |access-date=March 26, 2012}}</ref> Decker began recording in April 2011.<ref name="title">https://www.twitter.com/iamjessiejames/status/54724151990165504 {{dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref> "When You Say My Name" was produced by Wright and released on January 31, 2012.
