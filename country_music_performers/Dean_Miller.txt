==Biography==
Although born in [[Los Angeles, California]], Miller was also raised in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]].<ref name="allmusic"/> He got his musical start in local clubs around Santa Fe, before moving back to Los Angeles in the early 1980s and joining a band called the Sarcastic Hillbillies.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p224399|pure_url=yes}} |title=Dean Miller |accessdate=September 5, 2007 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> At the same time, he attended college, in addition to briefly pursuing a career in acting.<ref name="cst"/><ref name="allmusic"/> Miller later moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he worked as a staff songwriter for Sony/Tree Publishing, and later various other staff songwriter positions.

By 1995, he was signed to the Nashville division of [[Capitol Records]] Nashville. Two years later, his eponymous debut album was released on the Capitol label. The lead-off single "Nowhere, USA" received significant airplay in Chicago even before its release date;<ref name="cst"/> however, it and two additional singles failed to reach Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. Another single, "Wake Up and Smell the Whiskey", was co-written and previously recorded by [[Brett James]], who would later become a popular Nashville songwriter in the 2000s. Miller parted ways with Capitol not long afterward.<ref name="allmusic"/> In 2000, two country artists charted with singles that Miller co-wrote: [[Terri Clark]]'s "[[A Little Gasoline]]" and [[Trace Adkins]]'s "I'm Gonna Love You Anyway".

In 2002, Miller signed to the newly formed [[Universal South Records]], where he recorded his second album, ''Just Me''. The lead-off single "Love Is a Game" peaked at No.&nbsp;58, but the album was never released. Universal also released a rendition of "[[Old Toy Trains]]", which Roger had written for Dean when he was two years old; this version included Roger's vocals dubbed in on the chorus.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bessman|first=Jim|date=December 7, 2002|title=Words & Music|magazine=Billboard|volume=114|issue=49|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Og0EAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22old+toy+trains%22+%22dean+miller%22&pg=PA68}}</ref> Miller later left Universal South's roster as well.<ref name="cmt1">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1509945/20050920/miller_dean.jhtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070930062157/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1509945/20050920/miller_dean.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=For Dean Miller, It's Out-of-the-Box ''Platinum'' |accessdate=September 5, 2007 |last=Morris |first=Edward |date=September 2, 2005|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT.com]]}}</ref>

Miller signed to the country music division of [[Koch Entertainment]] in 2005. His third album, titled ''Platinum'', was released that same year.<ref name="cmt1"/> This album included the track "Right Now", which the band [[Rushlow]] had previously recorded as the title track of their 2003 debut album, as well as the non-charting single "Hard Love". Koch Entertainment closed its country division in 2005, however, and Miller was yet again without a record deal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1511641/20051017/miller_dean.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023904/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1511641/20051017/miller_dean.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Koch Entertainment Closes Country Division |accessdate=September 5, 2007 |last= |first= |date=October 1, 2005|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT.com]]}}</ref>
