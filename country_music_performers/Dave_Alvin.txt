'''David Albert Alvin''' (born November 11, 1955) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer. He is a former and founding member of the [[roots rock]] band [[the Blasters]]. Alvin has recorded and performed as a solo artist since the late 1980s and has been involved in various side projects and collaborations. He has had brief stints as a member of the bands [[X (U.S. band)|X]] and [[the Knitters]]. He often refers to himself as "Blackjack Dave," in reference to his 1998 album and song of the same name.

== Early life ==
Alvin grew up in [[Downey, California]]. He and his older brother, [[Phil Alvin]], as teenagers frequented [[blues]], [[rockabilly]] and [[country music]] venues.<ref name="All Music bio">Deming, Mark. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dave-alvin-mn0000679219/biography Dave Alvin: Biography].

== Career ==
=== With the Blasters ===
In 1979, Alvin and his brother Phil formed the roots-rock band [[The Blasters]] with fellow Downey residents [[Bill Bateman (drummer)|Bill Bateman]] and [[John Bazz]].<ref name="All Music bio" /><ref name="Blasters bio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-blasters-mn0000757177/biography | title=Artist Biography: The Blasters | publisher=AllMusic.com | author=Sullivan, Denise | author-link=Denise Sullivan }}</ref> Alvin served as the group's lead guitarist and chief songwriter.<ref name="Blasters bio" /> ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' noted the ever-increasing numbers of originals that Alvin wrote for the Blasters, along with his maturation into a great songwriter.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Rough Guide to Rock | publisher=Rough Guides | editor1=Buckley, Peter|editor2=Buckley, Jonathan| year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 106] | isbn=978-1-85828-457-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 }}</ref>

Other artists have covered Alvin's songs. For example, "[[Marie Marie]]" became a British-German top 20 hit in 1980 for [[Shakin' Stevens]] and received a [[zydeco]] treatment in 1987 from [[Buckwheat Zydeco]]. [[Dwight Yoakam]] recorded "Long White Cadillac" in 1989.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin was in the original lineup until 1986. His departure reflected internal tension in the band, but ultimately he wanted to sing his own songs while his brother [[Phil Alvin]] was the established lead vocalist for the group.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article36306066.html |author=Sculley, Alan |title=Alvin brothers: Losing no more time playing apart |work=Sacramento Bee |date=September 23, 2015 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

Alvin has rejoined the Blasters for some reunion tours and live albums with the original lineup. He has also occasionally performed with the band under other circumstances as well.<ref name="rosen">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/entertainment/tn-blr-1216-the-blasters-frontman-phil-alvin-takes-to-the-stage-new-years-eve-after-a-scary-2012-story.html |author=Rosen, Craig |title=The Blasters' frontman Phil Alvin takes to the stage New Year's Eve after a scary 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 15, 2012 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== With X and the Knitters ===
Alvin served a brief stint as the lead guitarist of the Los Angeles–based [[alternative rock]] band [[X (American band)|X]]. He left X in 1987 to work on a solo project after the group recorded their album ''[[See How We Are]]''.

Alvin was also a member of the [[country folk]] band [[The Knitters]], an offshoot of X. He appeared on their 1985 album  ''Poor Little Critter on the Road'' and their 2005 follow-up, ''The Modern Sounds of the Knitters''.<ref name="All Music bio" />

=== With the Flesh Eaters ===
In the early 1980s, Alvin, along with fellow Blasters members Bill Bateman and [[Steve Berlin]], performed on ''[[A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (album)|A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die]]'' by the Los Angeles [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[the Flesh Eaters]]. This lineup, which also included [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] and [[D.J. Bonebrake]], assembled once again in 2006, performing three shows in California and one in England to mark the album's 25th anniversary. They reunited briefly in 2015 for a five-show tour and again for an eight-show run in 2018. They issued a new album, ''[[I Used to Be Pretty]]'', in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://americanahighways.org/2019/03/19/show-review-flesh-eaters-rock-dcs-union-stage-with-porcupine/ |author=Cook, Glenn. |title=Show Review: Flesh Eaters Rock DC's Union Stage With Porcupine |work=Americana Highways |date=March 19, 2019 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>

=== Solo ===
[[File:Dave Alvin.jpg|thumb|Alvin in 2007]]
Alvin's first solo album, ''Romeo's Escape'' (entitled ''Every Night About This Time'' in England), was released in 1987. It was well received by critics but did not sell well. Because of the album's low sales, Alvin's recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] was terminated. He then toured with [[Mojo Nixon]] and [[Beat Farmers|Country Dick Montana]], billed as the Pleasure Barons; an album recorded live on their 1993 tour was released.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin's second solo album, ''Blue Blvd'', was released by [[Hightone Records]] in 1991. It received positive reviews and had moderate sales. His album ''Museum of Heart'' was released in 1993. He recorded ''[[King of California (album)|King of California]]'', an album of [[acoustic music]], in 1994. In 2000, he recorded the album ''[[Public Domain (album)|Public Domain: Songs From the Wild Land]]'', a collection of traditional folk and blues classics, which earned him a [[Grammy]] award for Best Contemporary [[Folk music|Folk]] Album.<ref name="All Music bio" />

In 2011, Alvin recorded the album ''[[Eleven Eleven (Dave Alvin album)|Eleven Eleven]]'', released by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The album marked his return to rock roots.<ref name="rs">{{cite magazine|last=Scherman|first=Tony|title=Dave Alvin: Eleven Eleven|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 21, 2011|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/eleven-eleven-20110621}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in a review of the album, called Alvin "an underrecognized guitar hero".<ref name="rs" />

=== Further recordings with Phil Alvin ===
In 2014, Dave and Phil Alvin, as a duo, released the album ''Common Ground'', consisting of their versions of songs by [[Big Bill Broonzy]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5908507/the-blasters-dave-phil-alvin-talk-common-ground-album-premiere-all-by-myself-song-listen-exclusive | title=Dave Alvin & Phil Alvin Talk 'Common Ground' Album, Premiere 'All By Myself' Song: Listen Exclusively | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=February 19, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Gallo, Phil}}</ref> It was the first studio collaboration of the brothers since the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-torn-up-band-of-brothers-finally-on-the-mend-1401411544 | title=A Torn-Up Band of Brothers, Finally on the Mend | work=[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] | date=May 29, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Dougherty, Steve}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-alvin-brothers-20140608-story.html#page=1 | title=Dave and Phil Alvin, Former Blasters Mates, Resurrect Partnership | work=Los Angeles Times | date=June 6, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Lewis, Randy}}</ref> In 2015 they released ''Lost Time'', a collection of covers including four songs by [[Big Joe Turner]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dave Alvin: Return of the Battlin' Brothers|page=24|date=March 2016|newspaper=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|last=Cohen|first=Elliot Stephen}}</ref>

In live performance, Alvin assumed the role of emcee and storyteller. The brothers also worked Blasters tunes into the set list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elmoremagazine.com/2016/09/reviews/shows/dave-and-phil-alvin-and-the-guilty-ones |title=Dave and Phil Alvin and the Guilty Ones |work=Elmore Magazine |date=September 9, 2016 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== With Jimmie Dale Gilmore ===
Alvin and Texas singer-songwriter [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] teamed on the 2018 album ''Downey to Lubbock'' (the title is a reference to where each man grew up).

As seen in his live performances with brother Phil, Alvin's stories between songs were a notable part of the stage shows with Gilmore and their supporting musicians.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://glidemagazine.com/214083/dave-alvin-and-jimmie-dale-gilmore-prove-perfect-collaborators-in-portland-show-review-photos/ |author=Ferguson, Neil |title=Dave Alvin and Jimmie Dale Gilmore Prove Perfect Collaborators in Portland |work=Glide Magazine |date=October 1, 2018 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

In April 2022, Alvin announced his return to public performance after a grueling two-year battle with different forms of cancer that started in May 2020. He chose to do so with Gilmore, scheduling nine dates in California for late June and early July 2022.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/dave-alvin-cancer-interview-1336284/ |author=Bernstein, Jonathan |title='I Should Have Died': Dave Alvin, Seminal California Country-Punk Guitarist, Talks Private Cancer Battle |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2022 |access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>
