Williams was born, the youngest of three sons, on May 27, 1939, in [[Floydada, Texas]], United States.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His parents were Loveta Mae (née Lambert; 1914 &ndash; 2007) and James Andrew "Jim" Williams (1898 &ndash; 1982).<ref>Texas Birth Index 1903-1997</ref> He grew up in [[Portland, Texas]], and graduated from Gregory-Portland High School in 1958.

Prior to forming the [[Folk music|folk-pop]] group [[Pozo-Seco Singers]], Williams served with the United States Army Security Agency for two years. After an honorable discharge, he worked various odd jobs in order to support himself and his family.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/williams-don|title=Don Williams Singer, songwriter, guitarist|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=2017-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alancackett.com/don-williams|title=Don Williams|website=alancackett.com|access-date=2017-09-10}}</ref>
