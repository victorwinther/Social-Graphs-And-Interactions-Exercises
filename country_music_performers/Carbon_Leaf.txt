==History==
===1992–2004: The Constant Ivy Music years===
[[Image:Carbon Leaf (Barry Privett) in Cleveland, OH Grog Shop.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Barry Privett]]
Carbon Leaf got their start at [[Randolph-Macon College]] in [[Virginia]] in 1992, practicing in an auditorium on campus. Their next step was playing backyard parties, mixers, fraternity, and sorority parties. Shortly after everyone graduated, they moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. From Richmond, they played the college circuit in Virginia and up the East Coast before moving on to clubs. Their style is not "Brazilian Polka Metal", despite the joking claims of guitarist Carter Gravatt (B., David. 2002).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814181900/http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm |title=Carbon Leaf Interview -Chicago, 2002 |work=Blue Tint Magazine |archive-date=August 14, 2004}}</ref>

''[[Meander (album)|Meander]]'', their first album, was released in 1995. The first songs Carbon Leaf wrote, including "One Day" and "Country Monkee", are on the album.

''[[Shadows in the Banquet Hall]]'', released in 1997, includes "Flood", "Wolftrap and Fireflies", and "Attica's Flower Box Window". An award-winning video was made for "Flood".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

''[[Ether~Electrified Porch Music]]'' (1999) is the first album with Jordan Medas as the [[bassist]] and contains "Home", "American Tale", and "Blue Ridge Laughing".

The producers of ''[[Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!]]'' were using an acoustic version of "Life Less Ordinary" as a placeholder in the film. The request to license it snowballed into wanting to license additional songs and ultimately a request that Carbon Leaf do the majority of the soundtrack.<ref name="WCNR interview">{{cite AV media |date=March 20, 2010 |title=Corner Lounge: Carbon Leaf 3-20-10 |url=http://67.72.16.166/wcnr/2281464.mp3 |format=mp3 |medium=radio |publisher=[[WCNR]] |location=Keswick, Virginia |access-date=March 23, 2010 |time=19:24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705234754/http://67.72.16.166/wcnr/2281464.mp3 |archive-date=July 5, 2011 }}</ref> Carbon Leaf contributed six songs to the soundtrack for the animated film, including  versions of "Life Less Ordinary" and "Let Your Troubles Roll By" with new alternate lyrics (in the second verse) and "The Friendship Song".<ref name="Richmond, VA subreddit - We are Carbon Leaf, ask us anything!">{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/2o5zlu/comment/cmkk7q6/ |title=We are Carbon Leaf, ask us anything! |website=reddit.com |access-date=June 25, 2024}}</ref> The soundtrack and the direct-to-DVD movie were released on March 2, 2010.<ref name="CG2 OST">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033G9NUQ/ |title=Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey (Soundtrack) |website=Amazon |access-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref>

In March 2010, the band announced that they were amicably parting ways with their label, Vanguard Records, intending to record and release music on their own schedule and distribute it over the internet.<ref name="WCNR interview"/> Their plan was to market their music by giving it away at shows, a strategy not compatible with Vanguard's focus on CD sales.<ref name="WCNR interview"/> 

On July 6, 2010, they released ''[[How the West was One (Carbon Leaf album)|How the West was One]]'', inspired by and written during their tour of the [[Western United States|American West]], initially on their website and subsequently on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com]].
