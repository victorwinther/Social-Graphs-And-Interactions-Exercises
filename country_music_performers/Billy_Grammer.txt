'''Billy Wayne Grammer''' (August 28, 1925 – August 10, 2011) was an American [[country music]] singer and accomplished guitar player. He recorded the million-selling "[[Gotta Travel On]]", which made it onto both the [[Hot Country Songs|country]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|pop music]] [[record chart|charts]] in 1959. Grammer would become a regular performer on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], eventually designing, and marketing his namesake guitar after co-founding a guitar company, in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

The couple returned to their home in [[Franklin County, Illinois]].

===Music career===

When Grammer and his wife were living in Washington D.C., he was hired by [[Connie B. Gay]] as a singer in support of Gay's WARL radio program: ''Town and Country Time''. When Gay was preparing to replace the session guitarist, Grammer demonstrated his own guitar prowess, and was re-contracted in a dual-role as both singer and lead guitarist.<ref name="tsibs">{{Cite news |url=https://thesouthern.com/news/local/state-and-regional/article_4ad1cd20-c364-11e0-80e9-001cc4c03286.html#ixzz1Ued8cXHN |title=Grand Ole Opry legend Billy Grammer dead at 85 |newspaper=[[The Southern Illinoisan]] |date=August 10, 2011 |first=Brent |last=Stewart}}</ref>

After he spoke, Wallace mingled with the crowd, and [[Arthur Bremer]] shot a concealed handgun at the presidential candidate. The outcome was Wallace's [[paralysis]], leaving him using a wheelchair for the rest of his life.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news |first=William |last=Greider |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/sept98/wallace051672.htm |title=George Wallace Remembered |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 16, 1972 |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> "I've said all along, if they wanted to do something like this, they do it under these circumstances," Grammer said, weeping, after the incident.<ref name="washingtonpost.com" />
