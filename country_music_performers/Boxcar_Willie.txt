==Biography==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2023}}
According to his birth record, Martin was born in [[Ovilla, Texas]], to Birdie and Edna Mae Martin. He joined the [[United States Air Force]] in May 1949, and served as a [[flight engineer]] on the [[B-29 Super Fortress]] during the [[Korean War]] in the early 1950s. In [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], Martin was once sitting at a railroad crossing and a fellow that closely resembled his chief boom operator, Willie Wilson, passed by sitting in a [[boxcar]]. He said, "There goes Willie." He pulled over and wrote a song entitled "Boxcar Willie".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It eventually stuck and became Martin's nickname. In 1962, Martin met his future wife, Lloene, in [[Boise, Idaho]]. They later had four children.

In [[San Jose, California]], Martin attended a talent show as "Boxcar Willie" and performed under that nickname for the first time. He won first place and a $150 prize. That was his part-time vocation, however, as he was still in the Air Force and had been flying daily missions. In the early 1970s, while assigned to the [[181st Airlift Squadron|136th Air Refueling Wing]] of the [[Texas Air National Guard]], Martin served as a flight engineer aboard the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]] and participated in Operation Creek Party. This operation provided critical in-flight refueling services for fighter aircraft assigned to the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] for 10 years.

In 1976, Martin retired from the Air Force and became a full-time performer. One of his first national appearances was a win on [[Chuck Barris]]' ''[[The Gong Show]]''. In the late 1970s, Martin traveled to [[Grand Prairie, Texas]], where he purchased hundreds of [[8-track tape]]s pre-recorded with his music to sell later in various places. After he received a contract with other recording studios, he discontinued his dealings with Cleo McDonald.{{Context inline|date=January 2023}}

Martin entered American mainstream pop culture consciousness due to a series of television commercials for record compilations of artists who were obscure in the United States, yet had large international followings, such as [[Slim Whitman]] and [[Gheorghe Zamfir]]. Martin went on to become a star in [[country music]]. In 1981, Martin achieved a professional landmark by being inducted into the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=171}}</ref> He also had success outside of the United States, with his 1980 album ''King of the Road'' giving him his greatest chart success by reaching No. 5 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In 1985, Martin moved to [[Branson, Missouri]], and purchased a theater on [[Missouri Route 76]], also known as 76 Country Boulevard. In addition to the Boxcar Willie Theater, he opened a museum and eventually had two motels, both bearing his name. Martin was one of the first big stars to open a show in Branson, paving the way for the other nationally known names that followed.<ref name="salonobit">[http://www.salon.com/people/obit/1999/04/14/boxcar/ "BoxCar Willie"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107052516/http://www.salon.com/people/obit/1999/04/14/boxcar/ |date=November 7, 2004 }}, ''Salon'' obituary, April 14, 1999.</ref> He performed at his theater in Branson until his death.

On February 23, 1992, Martin was featured on the second-season premier of ''[[Tracks Ahead]]'' in which he performed with his band at the Boxcar Willie Theater.

==Death==
Martin was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] in 1996, and died on April 12, 1999, in [[Branson, Missouri]] at the age of 67. He was buried at Ozarks Memorial Park in Branson.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=Laurie E.|title=Handbook of Texas Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CE8xiT3pV6QC&pg=PT239|year=2012|publisher=Texas State Historical Assn|isbn=978-0-87611-297-7|page=239}}</ref> [[Major League Baseball]] umpire [[Joe West (umpire)|"Cowboy" Joe West]] was among his pallbearers.

==Legacy==
After a major reconstruction project, the overpass carrying [[Farm to Market Road 664]] (locally known as Ovilla Road) over [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] in [[Red Oak, Texas]], was renamed the Boxcar Willie Memorial Overpass. A small park, two blocks from the [[National Mall]], near the [[L'Enfant Plaza station]] in Washington, D.C., was renamed Boxcar Willie Park. Martin is still recalled by his nickname, "America's Favorite Hobo".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://wrvhs.org/announcements/tuesday-talk-americas-favorite-hobo/ |title=Tuesday Talk: America's Favorite Hobo |publisher=White River Valley Historical Society |website=wrvhs.org |date=January 16, 2023 |accessdate=January 28, 2023}}</ref> One of his sons, Larry Martin, has performed professionally under the stage name of Boxcar Willie Jr.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.101highlandlakes.com/news/boxcar-willie-tribute-lantex-theater |title=Boxcar Willie Jr. paying tribute to late father at LanTex Theater |website=101highlandlakes.com |date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=January 28, 2023}}</ref>
