'''Robert Andrykowski''' (born March 1, 1961) is an American [[country music]] artist who records under the name '''Davis Daniel'''. Between 1991 and 1996, he recorded three studio albums on various divisions of [[Polygram Records]]: 1991's ''[[Fighting Fire with Fire (album)|Fighting Fire with Fire]]'', 1994's ''[[Davis Daniel (album)|Davis Daniel]]'', and 1995's ''[[I Know a Place (Davis Daniel album)|I Know a Place]]''. In that same time span, seven of his singles entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, including the Top 40 hits "[[Picture Me]]", "[[For Crying Out Loud (song)|For Crying Out Loud]]" and "[[Fighting Fire with Fire (song)|Fighting Fire with Fire]]."

==Biography==
Robert Andrykowski was born in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]], on March 1, 1961. Over time, his family moved to [[Nebraska]], and subsequently to [[Denver, Colorado]].<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Davis-Daniel.html |title=Davis Daniel biography |accessdate=2009-07-08 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref>

As a teenager, he found work singing at various nightclubs throughout [[Denver, Colorado]]. By the late 1980s, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], eventually adopting the stage name Davis Daniel and landing a record deal with [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]/[[Polygram Records]] in 1991 with the help of his music producer [[Ron Haffkine]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Picks and Pans Review|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20115462,00.html|work=No 26|agency=People Magazine|volume=35|date=7 August 1991}}</ref>

''[[Fighting Fire with Fire (album)|Fighting Fire with Fire]]'' was issued that year. It produced four singles on the country charts: "[[Picture Me]]" at number 28, followed by "[[For Crying Out Loud (song)|For Crying Out Loud]]" at number 13, the [[Fighting Fire with Fire (song)|title track]] at number 27 and "Still Got a Crush on You" at number 48.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=113–114|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}<!--|accessdate=16 February 2010--></ref> [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album a B rating, comparing Daniel's vocal technique to that of [[Keith Whitley]] and saying that he showed promise in carrying on in Whitley's tradition.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/fighting-fire-fire/|title=''Fighting Fire with Fire'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=22 November 1991|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=16 February 2010}}</ref>

Daniel's second album, the self-titled ''[[Davis Daniel (album)|Davis Daniel]]'', followed in 1994 on [[Polydor Records]]. Its singles, "I Miss Her Missing Me," "William and Mary" and "Tyler," all peaked outside the top 40 in the United States, although "Tyler" reached number 39 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts in Canada. "I Miss Her Missing Me" had been released by Mercury, which had originally planned to release the album in 1993 under the title ''Undeniable'' before Mercury underwent a management change that resulted in Daniel moving to Polydor.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=February 4, 1995|title=Polydor's Davis Daniel hits chord with breakthrough single|magazine=Billboard|pages=38, 40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAsEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22polydor+nashville%22&pg=PA38}}</ref> [[Cub Koda]] of [[Allmusic]] gave the album three stars out of five, saying, "there's enough good stuff here to make you think that he might develop into something more than a one-shot artist."<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r199358|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Davis Daniel'' review|last=Koda|first=Cub|work=Allmusic|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> ''New Country'' magazine's Michael McCall gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, praising the lyrics of "Tyler" and "Out Here Sits the King", but criticizing the other songs for lacking substance.<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 1995|title=Album reviews|last=McCall|first=Michael|journal=New Country|volume=2|issue=4|pages=61–62}}</ref>

For his third album, Daniel moved to [[A&M Records]]. This album, ''[[I Know a Place (Davis Daniel album)|I Know a Place]]'', was released in 1996. Its lead-off single "I'm Not Listening Anymore" was part of a "Mystery Artist" contest on [[Country Music Television]] (CMT), which showed two versions of the song's [[music video]]: one where Daniel's face was obscured, and another where it was shown plainly.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=18 May 1996|title=Mystery Artist contest is A&M's key for Daniel|magazine=Billboard|pages=28–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uA0EAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22davis+daniel%22+%22fighting+fire&pg=PA28}}</ref> This single did not enter the charts.

After his third album, Daniel mostly stayed at home with his wife and children. He resumed touring in 2001 with a band called Big Heart, and released a new single called "Is It Just Me?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q31lAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Q5QNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2046,1266239&dq=davis-daniel+fighting-fire&hl=en|title=Big Heart teams up with Davis Daniel and hits the road|last=Henson|first=Tom|date=17 January 2001|work=The Greenville Leader|pages=A1, A9|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordentertainment.com/artistdetail.aspx?ArtistID=21720|title=Davis Daniel|work=Ford Entertainment|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>
