==Early life==
Keelor was born Francis McIntyre in [[Inverness, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], Nova Scotia, on August 29, 1954.<ref name="maple">{{cite web|url=http://maplemusic.com/artists/gke/bio.asp|title=Bio – Greg Keelor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020225055927/http://maplemusic.com/artists/gke/bio.asp|access-date=August 30, 2018|archive-date=February 25, 2002}}</ref> Though he didn't know until adulthood, his birth parents had put him up for adoption. Keelor was adopted at age three and raised in [[Montréal]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/greg-keelor/|title=Greg Keelor|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>

Keelor attended [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]], and it was there that he befriended football teammate [[Jim Cuddy]] in 1971. After graduation, Keelor, Cuddy and a group of college friends, in search of adventure, traveled to Western Canada in a rundown old school bus. The bus broke down in [[Saskatchewan]], and Keelor somehow or another ended up in [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]] where he worked for a time. It was in Lake Louise that he learned to play the guitar and first considered a career as a musician.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

== Career ==
Keelor has been friends with [[Jim Cuddy]] since both attended [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]] high school. When they both had finished university, they decided to form a band which they called the Hi-Fi's, along with Jim Sublett on drums and Malcolm Schell playing bass. The band released a single in 1980 featuring "I Don't Know Why (You Love Me)" and on the B side "Look What You've Done". The record was not a big commercial success, though, and when they couldn't get a record deal in Toronto, they headed off to New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canuckistanmusic.com/index.php?maid=308|title=Review of Hi-Fi's I Don't Know Why (You Love Me)|website=canuckistanmusic.com|publisher=Canuckistan Music|last1=Panontin|first1=Michael|access-date=February 14, 2015}}</ref> A while after returning to Toronto from New York, Keelor and Cuddy formed Blue Rodeo.

Keelor is also a producer, having co-produced Blue Rodeo's ''[[Lost Together (Blue Rodeo album)|Lost Together]]'' and solo-producing [[Cuff the Duke]]'s albums ''[[Way Down Here]]'' and ''[[Morning Comes (album)|Morning Comes]]''.

Keelor also composed an original soundtrack for the 2010 Canadian Western comedy ''[[Gunless]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/blue_rodeo-better_off_as_we_are| title=Blue Rodeo- Better Off As We Are| work=Exclaim Magazine| access-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2000, Keelor and Blue Rodeo bandmate Jim Cuddy were the recipients of the National Achievement Award at the annual [[SOCAN]] Awards held in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2000-socan-awards |title=2000 Socan Awards &#124; Socan |access-date=August 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916155756/https://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2000-socan-awards |archive-date=September 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2013, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] along with [[Jim Cuddy]], "for their contributions to Canadian music and for their support of various charitable causes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15482&lan=eng|title=Governor General Announces 90 New Appointments to the Order of Canada|date=December 30, 2013}}</ref>
