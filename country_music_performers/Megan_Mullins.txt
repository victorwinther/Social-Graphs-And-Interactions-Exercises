'''Megan Mullins''' (born November 24, 1987)<ref name="allmusic" /> is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. At age 18, she made her debut on the country music scene with the single "Ain't What It Used to Be," a Top 40 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Her debut album was originally slated for release in 2006 but was never released.<ref name="fort">{{cite news|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071005/ENT02/710050387 |title=Singing a Broken record |accessdate=December 13, 2007 |last=Penhollow |first=Steve |date=October 5, 2007 |newspaper=[[Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette]]}}</ref>

==Biography==
Mullins was born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/megan-mullins-mn0001521468 | title=Megan Mullins Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref> She began to learn several instruments at an early age, and by age 3, she had won the Indiana State Fair Showmanship award at the State Fiddle Championship.<ref name="allmusic"/> Many of her family members are also professional musicians, most notably her brother Marcus, with whom she performed on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] at age 14.<ref name="allmusic"/>

By 2006, she was signed to [[Broken Bow Records]], an independent record label. Her first single, titled "Ain't What It Used to Be" (also recorded by [[Billy Currington]] on his debut album) was issued early that year, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;32 on the country music charts. A second single, "Cryin' Days," failed to chart at all, and Mullins announced in October 2007 that she would be returning to the studio for further work on the album.<ref name="fort"/>

Although the album has not been released, Mullins remained on Broken Bow's roster. In 2008, Mullins recorded a duet with former [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] lead singer [[Randy Owen]] (who is also signed to Broken Bow), for his solo debut album ''[[One on One (Randy Owen album)|One on One]]''. Mullins also plays fiddle in Owen's road band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/concertreview.asp?xid=327 |title=Randy Owen leaves Alabama behind |accessdate=December 2, 2008 |last=Remz |first=Jeffrey B. |date=August 3, 2008|work=[[Country Standard Time]]}}</ref> In April 2009, she switched to Stoney Creek, a sister label also started by the founder of Broken Bow. Her first release for Stoney Creek, "Long Past Gone", made its chart debut in May 2009, and peaked at No.&nbsp;48 later in the year. A second single for the label, "Tradin' My Halo for Horns," failed to chart. In August 2010, Mullins and Stoney Creek parted ways.
