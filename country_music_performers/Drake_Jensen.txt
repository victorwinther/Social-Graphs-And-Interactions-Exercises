In November 2012, he released a video in which he performed a cover of [[Tammy Wynette]]'s hit song "[[Stand By Your Man]]" featuring drag queen [[Willam Belli]] from [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|Season 4]] of ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.musicnewsnashville.com/drake-jensen-debuts-stand-by-your-man-video-featuring-willam-belli|title=Drake Jensen Debuts Stand By Your Man Video Featuring Willam Belli|last=Harr|first=Dan|date=November 9, 2012|work=Music News Nashville|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref> The song was released as the seventh single from Willam's album ''[[The Wreckoning (Willam Belli album)|The Wreckoning]]''.

Also in November 2012, he released his first Christmas album ''Christmas at Home'', featuring the song of the same name by fellow [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] singer-songwriter [[Rita MacNeil]], as well as "Home Again" by Duncan Wells, also of Cape Breton.  The latter song was made popular by Cookie Rankin of [[The Rankin Family]].

In December 2012, blogger [[Andy Towle]] chose Jensen as one of the top 50 most influential comings out of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2012/12/2012_gay_coming_out.html|title=I'm Gay: The 50 Most Powerful Coming Outs of 2012|last=Towle|first=Andy|date=December 17, 2012|work=Towleroad|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>

The first single, "When It Hurts Like That" by Matt Ullman and Kyle Morrison Marion, from his second studio album ''OUTlaw'' was released via video on YouTube on January 30, 2013.  The video was filmed in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], North Carolina by Blake Faucette and Justin Reich.  Within four weeks of release, the video received over 100,000 views, and the single was named TRAX HEADSTARTER single of the week, having received the most spins that week at Canadian radio.

Jensen was one of the headliners at [[Waterloo Region]]'s [[tri-Pride]] music festival on June 1, 2013.<ref>[http://www.therecord.com/sports-story/3243670-pride-week-celebrations-culminate-in-live-music-festival/ "Pride Week celebrations culminate in live music festival"]. ''[[The Record (Waterloo Region)|The Record]]'', May 24, 2013.</ref>

On June 13, 2013, Jensen released the video for "Scars" during his performance at [[Nashville Pride]]'s Pride Rocks! pre-party at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in Nashville, where songwriters Zita DaSilva and Don Graham saw it for the first time.

In December 2013, Jensen continued the collaboration with Canadian songwriters Graham and DaSilva by releasing the original Christmas single "Live Every Day (Like It Was Christmas Day)" along with a video produced by Jonathan Edwards of Corvidae Music.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cashboxcanada.ca/4626/drake-jensen-releases-christmas-songs|title=Drake Jensen Releases Christmas Songs|last=Graham|first=Sandy|date=December 5, 2013|work=Cashbox Canada|accessdate=December 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214035837/http://cashboxcanada.ca/4626/drake-jensen-releases-christmas-songs|archive-date=December 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Jensen also released a cover of [[Gene Autry]]'s "[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]", and is donating the proceeds to Santa Canada, an organization co-founded by friend Larry O. Lantz to bring Santa and the Christmas spirit to terminally ill children, at any time of the year.

2014 saw the recording of [[Luba (singer)|Luba]]'s "Everytime I See Your Picture".  Ms Kowalchyk gave her blessing to the cover version and accompanying video, and called Jensen "a maverick in the music industry".  This song would become the lead single of Jensen's third studio album, Retro, released in 2015. This album was a tribute to Jensen's musical influences, including Billy Idol, George Strait, Reba McEntire, Dan Seals among others.

In 2016, Jensen recorded "Wherever Love Takes Us", with a video filmed at Ottawa's [[Capital Pride (Ottawa)|Capital Pride]].  The song was promoted to Australian radio, and charted in the Top 40 there.<ref>[https://countrytrackschart.com.au/index.php?chartid=141 "Country Songs â€“ Top 40 â€“ Australian Airplay Chart"], December 31, 2016.</ref> The song gained even more popularity with the creation of the line dance "Waves of Love" by renowned Irish choreographer Gary O'Reilly. The dance is being taught and by line dance groups worldwide.  The song was also included as a bonus track in the limited CD-only re-release of RETRO.

Jensen teamed up with Vancouver's Patrick Masse in 2017 to record the duet "Go Your Own Way". Jensen was also included with his husband in the book "David Bowie Made Me Gay: 100 years of LGBT Music" by UK author Darryl W. Bullock.  He attended the book's launch at the [[British Library]] in London on September 8, 2017, hosted by the BBC's [[Simon Fanshawe]]. Jensen gave musical performances and participated in a discussion panel along with the author and [[Princess Julia]]. In  October of that year, Jensen and his producer/guitarist Jonathan Edwards were invited to perform on Via Rail's "[[Canadian (train)|The Canadian]]" train from Toronto to Vancouver and back.

Jensen's fourth studio album, "Sideshow" was released in 2018.  This album is a collection of his greatest hits, along with previously released tracks "Wherever Love Takes Us" and "Go Your Own Way", as well as newly recorded songs "Talk Me Down" and a cover of [[Lennie Gallant]]'s "Which Way Does The River Run".

"Talk Me Down" was released at select radio stations in 2019, and videos for it and "Which Way Does The River Run" were released to YouTube later that year.
