==Biography==
[[File:RayBensonApr09.jpg|thumb|237px|right|Ray Benson performing in April 2009]]

Benson was raised [[Jews|Jewish]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/66413/ray-benson-asleep-at-the-wheel-the-biggest-jew-in-country-music-video/ | title=Ray Benson (Asleep at the Wheel): The biggest Jew in country music &#91;VIDEO&#93; | date=7 October 2008 }}</ref> In 1970, Benson, a native of [[Philadelphia]], formed Asleep at the Wheel with friends [[Lucky Oceans]] and Leroy Preston in Paw Paw, West Virginia. They were soon joined by Gene Dobkin, a classmate of Benson's at [[Antioch College]], and Chris O'Connell. The group relocated to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in 1973 after a suggestion from [[Willie Nelson]].

Since then, the group has released more than twenty albums and earned nine [[Grammy]] awards. Though the band's lineup has changed greatly over the years (about 90 people have been part of Asleep at the Wheel at some point), Benson has always remained at the helm as the band's driving force.

In addition to his work with Asleep at the Wheel, Benson is also an accomplished producer whose credits include albums by [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Aaron Watson]], James Hand and [[Carolyn Wonderland]]; also single tracks for Willie Nelson, [[Aaron Neville]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Pam Tillis]], [[Trace Adkins]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[Vince Gill]].

In 2003, Benson released his first solo album entitled ''Beyond Time''.

Benson is also a founding member of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]], which raises money to help aging [[R&B]] artists, and a member of the board of directors of the SIMS Foundation, which provides low-cost mental health services to Austin musicians and their families.  He is also a trustee for the Texas chapter of [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|NARAS]], a board member of St Davids Community Health Foundation, and a board member and founding member of Health Alliance for Austin Musicians (HAAM).

Ray Benson is the former host of the ''Texas Music Scene'' TV show. In an interview, Benson said that when he was on the Board of Directors for Austin City Limits, he urged them to start a spin-off show that focused on Texas bands because Austin City Limits had grown beyond its original scope to become an international show. Later he had the opportunity to work with executive producer Tom Hoitsma to host the Texas Music Scene TV, which showcases Texas bands.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode179 episode 179 of the Americana Music Show], released February 17, 2014</ref>
