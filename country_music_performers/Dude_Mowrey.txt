'''Daniel "Dude" Mowrey''' (born February 10, 1972, in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]<ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Dude-Mowrey.html |title=Dude Mowrey biography |accessdate=May 24, 2008 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref>) is an American [[country music]] artist. Between 1991 and 1993, Mowrey recorded two studio albums, both on major labels: 1991's ''Honky Tonk'' on [[Capitol Records]] Nashville, and 1993's ''Dude Mowrey'' on [[Arista Nashville]]. These albums produced four singles for Mowrey on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. The first of these, "Cowboys Don't Cry", was later a Top 40 hit when [[Daron Norwood]] recorded it for his debut album three years after Mowrey's version. Another cut, "Fallin' Never Felt So Good", was later recorded by both [[Shawn Camp (musician)|Shawn Camp]] and [[Mark Chesnutt]].

Country singer [[Mel Tillis]] discovered Mowrey in the mid-1980s while Mowrey was still in his mid-teens;<ref name="oldies"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artsforthearts.org/dudemowrey.htm |title=May 12 featured guests |accessdate=May 24, 2008 |work=Arts for the Arts |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070616125033/http://www.artsforthearts.org/dudemowrey.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2007 }}</ref> Tillis also served as Mowrey's manager, and helped the singer sign to Capitol in 1991.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dude Mowrey slated for appearance on TNN |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=OSBB&d_place=OSBB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1033C71DEE9C8519&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |work=Ocala Star-Banner |date=March 24, 1993 |accessdate=May 24, 2008}}</ref> Mowrey's debut album, ''Honky Tonk'', was released in 1991. Included on it was the single "Cowboys Don't Cry", as well as "Honky Tonk Song", a song which Tillis initially wrote for [[Webb Pierce]]. By 1993, Mowrey had transferred to Arista Nashville, releasing a self-titled album that year, as well as three more singles. Arista label mate Lee Roy Parnell made a guest appearance in Mowrey's music video for the song "Hold on Elroy" which was filmed at an old cabin just outside Nashville, TN.
