==Early life==
At 14, Parenteau took up the fiddle.  After mastering the fiddle, he picked up other instruments like the guitar (both acoustic and electric) and the mandolin (both acoustic and electric).  Parenteau cites some of his influences as Bryan Sklar,<ref name=calledbycountry/> Freddie Pelltier,<ref name=calledbycountry/> and George Pistun<ref name=calledbycountry/>

==Career==
After picking up the violin at a young age, by 19 he was playing professionally.<ref name=calledbycountry/> In 1991, Parenteau was playing in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]] and was invited to a show by Neal McCoy who was also playing in Edmonton.<ref name=calledbycountry/> Upon talking with McCoy, Parenteau discovered they had similar taste in music.<ref name=calledbycountry/> McCoy was looking for a fiddle player, but didn't have the money to hire one.  Parenteau wanted the chance to audition and would not let up until he got the chance to audition.  Parenteau listened to the group [[Jam session|jamming]] and had a grasp of what they were playing.  It was that song he would use as the audition piece.<ref name=calledbycountry/> During his time touring with McCoy, Parenteau got to open for such artists as [[Merle Haggard]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Tim McGraw]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Faith Hill]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Buck Owens]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[George Jones]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Charlie Pride]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Loretta Lynn]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Charlie Daniels]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Hank Williams, Jr.]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Reba McEntire]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> [[Garth Brooks]],<ref name=calledbycountry/> and [[Shania Twain]].<ref name=calledbycountry/> Parenteau also graced the [[Grand Ole Opry]] stage.<ref name=calledbycountry/> Parenteau was the only member of the live band that was also on the recordings.<ref name=calledbycountry/> After performing with Neal McCoy for 12 years and playing 250–300 shows a year, Parenteau returned to Prince Albert to embark on a solo career.<ref name=calledbycountry/>

==Charity work==
Parenteau has done a number of humanitarian and charity work.  In 2001 SCMA International Humanitarian Award for his efforts.  He also appears on [[Telemiracle]] starting on the 32nd edition of the telethon.  Parenteau co-wrote the current Telemiracle opening theme song with [[Brad Johner]] entitled "You are the Miracle".  It became the theme in 2011.  He also embarks on a tour of elementary schools in Saskatchewan each year as a motivational speaker in which he spreads his message of anti-bullying.
