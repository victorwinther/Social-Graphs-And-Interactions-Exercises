==Early life==
Newman was born near Big Mamou, [[Louisiana]], United States.<ref name="AMG"/>  As a child, he listened more to [[Gene Autry]] than to the [[Cajun music]] of the area, but had a number of Cajun songs in his repertoire when, as a teenager, he joined Chuck Guillory's Rhythm Boys.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Early career==
He [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a few unsuccessful sides for [[J. D. "Jay" Miller]]'s [[Feature Records]] in the 1940s, but Miller persuaded [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to give the young singer an opportunity.<ref name="AMG"/>  In 1953, he was signed to [[Dot Records]] and the following year recorded "[[Cry, Cry, Darling]]", which reached No. 4 on the [[country music|country]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="AMG"/>

His recording success led the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], to hire him as a regular performer.<ref name="AMG"/> His next four records all reached [[Top 40|Top 10]] status, and in 1956 he was invited to become a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opry.com/artists/n/Newman_JimmyC.html |title=Grand Ole Opry &#124; The Show That Made Country Music Famous |website=Opry.com |access-date=August 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307125928/http://opry.com/artists/n/newman_jimmyc.html |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> That following year he released his biggest [[hit single|hit]], "A Fallen Star", which spent two weeks at No. 2 and also entered the top 25 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop chart.<ref name="AMG"/>

As an established artist, he began to integrate his Cajun influences into his music and recorded "Alligator Man", which was a top 25 record and continued to be his theme song at the Opry. In 1963, he released another top 10 hit, "The D.J. Cried".<ref name="AMG"/> His final hits came in 1965 and 1966 with "Artificial Rose" and "Back Pocket Money". When his commercial popularity declined he returned to Cajun music, forming his Cajun Country band and taking the high energy [[fiddle]]- and [[accordion]]-based music of his native Louisiana to fans around the world.  In 1976, his recording of the [[Cajun French]] song, "Lâche pas la patate" ("The Potato Song") earned [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] status in Canada. In 1991, Newman and Cajun Country earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for their album, ''Alligator Man''.

Entertainer [[Dolly Parton]] has long credited Newman with enabling her first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry, in 1959, describing how when she appeared at the Opry unannounced at age 13, asking to sing, Newman relinquished one of his two allotted slots to allow Parton to perform.

==Later career==
In 2000, he was inducted into the North American [[Country Music Association]]’s International Hall of Fame and in 2004 was inducted into the Cajun Hall of Fame. He is also honored in the Cajun Music Hall of Fame in Eunice, Louisiana, and in 2009 he was inducted into The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]]. He continued to tour and appear regularly at the Grand Ole Opry, making his last appearance on the show on June 6, 2014.<ref name=Tennessean>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/06/22/jimmy-c-newman-obituary/11232265/ |title=Jimmy C. Newman, Cajun country pioneer, dies at 86 |publisher=Tennessean.com |date=June 22, 2014 |access-date=August 18, 2014}}</ref> In 2006, he joined a select group of entertainers who have marked 50 years of Opry membership.

==Personal life==
