== Biography ==
Glaser was born in [[Spalding, Nebraska]], the son of Alice Harriet Marie (née Davis) and Louis Nicholas Glaser.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p23008/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Tompall Glaser biography |accessdate=April 1, 2008 |last=Wolff |first=Kurt |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?pid=166478715|title = Thomas Paul GLASER Obituary (2013) the Tennessean| website=[[Legacy.com]] }}</ref> He was raised on a farm along with his brothers [[Jim Glaser|Jim]] and Chuck. Growing up, Glaser and his brothers performed music in local venues and radio stations.<ref name="USAToday">"[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/08/13/tompall-glaser-dies/2650601/ Tompall Glaser, outlaw country artist, dies at 79]" by Peter Cooper, ''[[USA Today]]'', August 13, 2013.</ref>

In the 1950s, he recorded as a solo artist. He later formed a trio with brothers Chuck and Jim called [[Tompall & the Glaser Brothers]].<ref name="allmusic" /> In 1957, he and his brothers performed on [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s television show.<ref name="USAToday"/> They also shared the bill with [[Patsy Cline]] at [[The Mint Las Vegas|The Mint]] casino in Las Vegas, from November to December 1962.

Glaser's highest-charting solo single was [[Shel Silverstein]]'s "Put Another Log on the Fire", which peaked at No. 21 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts in 1975. He and his brothers also reached number 2 on the country charts with ''[[Lovin' Her Was Easier (than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)]]''.<ref name="HoustonPress">"[https://www.houstonpress.com/music/remembering-tompall-glaser-an-outlaw-just-beyond-the-spotlight-6761466 Remembering Tompall Glaser: An Outlaw Just Beyond the Spotlight]" by William Michael Smith, ''[[Houston Press]]'', August 14, 2013.</ref>

Tompall co-produced Waylon Jennings's influential 1973 album ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'', considered to be one of the first albums of the outlaw period.<ref name="HoustonPress"/> ''Honky Tonk Heroes'' has been called a "milestone album in the breaking of the Nashville studio/recording system, a true watershed event in the music business."<ref name="HoustonPress"/>

Tompall appeared with [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Jessi Colter]] on the 1976 album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''. The album was the first ever in country music to be certified [[Platinum (music sales)|platinum]] for sales of over one million copies.<ref name="NYT"/>

In the 1970s his Nashville recording studio [[Glaser Sound Studios]], dubbed "Hillbilly Central," was considered the nerve center of the nascent [[outlaw country]] movement.<ref name="NYT"/> Glaser ran the studio with his brothers and gave musicians control over what they recorded instead of their producers, unlike other Nashville studios of the time.<ref name="NYT"/> Among the groundbreaking albums recorded at his studio were [[John Hartford]]'s ''[[Aereo-Plain]]'' and [[Waylon Jennings]]' ''[[Dreaming My Dreams (Waylon Jennings album)|Dreaming My Dreams]]''.<ref name="USAToday"/>

Glaser and his brothers also ran a music publishing company that allowed songwriters to retain ownership and control of their material, which was also unusual for the time period.<ref name="NYT"/>

Glaser died on August 12, 2013, in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at the age of 79, after a long illness.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated Press|title=Tompall Glaser, an original Nashville outlaw, dies|url=http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/music_news/2013/08/tompall_glaser_an_original_nashville_outlaw_dies|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}{{dead link|date=May 2023}}</ref> He was survived by his wife, June Johnson Glaser. His brother, Jim, died of a heart attack on April 6, 2019, at the age of 81. His brother, Chuck, died two months later on June 10, 2019, at the age of 83.
