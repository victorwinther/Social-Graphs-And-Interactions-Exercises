==Early life==
Dunn was born in [[Coleman, Texas]], and attended 13 schools in his first 12 years of school{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}. He began school in New Mexico and finished his formal education at [[Abilene Christian University]] in 1975 as a psychology major. While playing [[bass guitar]] and singing with bands in clubs in the [[Abilene, Texas]], area, the university gave him the choice of either quitting the band or the university {{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}. He left the university, then moved to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], for a chance at the country music scene. He lived there for many years while drawing much inspiration from local [[honky tonk]]s such as Tulsa City Limits, prominently-featured in the music video for Brooks & Dunn's hit "[[Boot Scootin' Boogie]]". While in college, he served as a music and youth minister at Avoca Baptist Church in [[Avoca, Texas]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}.

===2011–2012: Debut solo album and departure from Sony===
[[File:RonnieDunnApr10.jpg|thumb|right|Dunn in April 2010]]
In late 2010, Dunn announced that he was working on a solo album. The album's first single, "[[Bleed Red]]", was released to country radio on January 29, 2011, and debuted at number 30 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart for the week ending February 19, 2011, and ended as a Top 10, his first of his solo career.

The album debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]], as well as number 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 45,000 copies in its first week in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/470542/adele-reclaims-no-1-on-billboard-200-book-of-mormon-makes-history|title=Adele Reclaims No. 1 on Billboard 200, ''Book of Mormon'' Makes History|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=June 15, 2011}}</ref>

In June 2012, Ronnie Dunn took to social media to ask his fans what the fourth single on the album should be. Shortly after, Ronnie got a call from the executives at Sony Music saying that his "fb post killed the "Let The Cowboy Rock" single. He then requested for radio to start playing "Once" as the next single. Before the song could be released to radio as a single, he was released from the label.

===2013–2014: Little Will-E Records and ''Peace, Love, and Country Music''===
In March 2013, Ronnie Dunn previewed the song "Country This" on SoundCloud. On June 4, 2013, Ronnie released the two new tracks, "Country This" and "Kiss You There", exclusively on iTunes. The songs were each previewed for a month on The Highway on Sirius XM.

On July 9, 2013, Dunn announced his new record deal, a joint effort between HitShop Records and his own label Little Will-E Records with HitShop executing radio promotion while Dunn retains personal brand control. The lead-off single for his second solo album, "Kiss You There", was released to country radio on July 29, 2013. After an unsuccessful run with "Kiss You There", Dunn and HitShop Records parted ways.

On November 19, 2013, Dunn released the second single from the forthcoming album, "Wish I Still Smoked Cigarettes". In January 2014 Dunn also released "Grown Damn Man" as a promotional single from the second solo album. The album, ''Peace, Love and Country Music'', was released on April 8, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Jon|title=Ronnie Dunn Releases "Peace, Love and Country Music"|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/news/ronnie-dunn-releases-peace-love-and-country-music|work=[[Country Weekly]]|access-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref>

===2014–2018: Nash Icon record deal and ''Tattooed Heart''===
[[File:FPO-Ronnie Dunn-3909 PORTRAIT.jpg|thumbnail|Ronnie Dunn]]
On December 1, 2014, Ronnie Dunn began to speculate on his Facebook page that he had signed with the newest imprint of [[Big Machine Label Group]], [[Valory Music Group|NASH Icon]], but the label never confirmed nor denied. On January 12, 2015, President of Big Machine [[Scott Borchetta]] officially announced that Dunn had joined [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Martina McBride]] making him the third artist to join the roster. Borchetta stated in a press release "Ronnie Dunn has one of the smoothest, most-recognized and most-popular voices of the last twenty-five years in Country music. I'm truly honored to have him join us and take his rightful place as an Icon. Great music is on the way." Dunn also commented in the article saying "This is the best possible scenario that I can imagine. The Big Machine and Cumulus combination is a force, and I am proud to be included in this innovative venture". The press release went on to announce Ronnie Dunn was about to hit the studio to record what is now his third solo album and that the lead-off single of the album was released in early spring of 2015.

The lead single from Dunn's third solo album, "Ain't No Trucks in Texas", was released on July 17, 2015. On April 22, 2016, Dunn announced the second single, "[[Damn Drunk]]", on his Facebook page.

In 2019, Brooks & Dunn returned to the studio for the first time since the release of their 2009 compilation, ''[[Number 1s... and Then Some|#1s... and Then Some]]''. The result was a new album, ''Reboot'', a collection of some of Brooks & Dunn's greatest hits re-recorded as duets between the duo and up-and-coming country music stars. The album was released on April 5, 2019. It debuted at No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Country Albums]] chart.
