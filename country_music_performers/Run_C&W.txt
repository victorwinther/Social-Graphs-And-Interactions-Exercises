The band's name is a mix of the abbreviation for the "country & western" music genre ([[Country music|C&W]]), and [[Run DMC]], a popular hip-hop group of the time.

The band was composed of veteran musicians including [[lead vocals|lead vocalist]] [[Russell Smith (singer)|Russell Smith]], formerly of the [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]]; [[banjo]]ist [[Bernie Leadon]], formerly of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]; along with [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] songwriters [[Jim Photoglo]] and [[Vince Melamed]], both of whom played various instruments.<ref name="allmusic"/> In performance and in the album artwork and liner notes, the members portrayed fictitious non-identical quadruplets The Burns Brothers, each with [[pun]] names: [[wikt:crash and burn|Crash'n Burns]], G.W. "Wash" Burns, [[sideburns|Side Burns]], and [[rug burn|Rug Burns]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Their father was known as "[[wikt:dadburn|Dad Burns]]" and their mother as [[auburn hair|Augusta "Au" Burns]].

Run C&W recorded two albums, both on [[MCA Records]]: 1993's ''Into the Twangy-First Century'', followed by 1994's ''Row vs. Wade'', and filmed at least one [[music video]].
