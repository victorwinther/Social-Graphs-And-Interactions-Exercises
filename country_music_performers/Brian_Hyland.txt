'''Brian Hyland''' (born November 12, 1943) is an American pop singer and instrumentalist who was particularly successful during the early 1960s.  He had a [[Chart-topper|No.&nbsp;1 hit]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with "[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini]]" in 1960.  Other hits include "[[Sealed with a Kiss]]" and "[[Gypsy Woman (The Impressions song)|Gypsy Woman]]", which both reached No.&nbsp;3.  Hyland continued recording into the 1970s. [[AllMusic]] [[music journalism|journalist]] Jason Ankeny said: "Hyland's puppy-love pop virtually defined the sound and sensibility of [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] during the pre-[[The Beatles|Beatles]] era."<ref name="AMG" /> Although his status as a [[teen idol]] faded, he went on to release several [[country music|country]]-influenced albums and had additional chart hits later in his career.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Biography==
Hyland was born in [[Woodhaven, Queens|Woodhaven]], Queens, New York City.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Ankeny|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-hyland-mn0000516202/biography|title=Brian Hyland Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 28, 2009}}</ref> He studied guitar and [[clarinet]] as a child, and sang in his [[church choir]].<ref name="AMG"/> At 14, he co-founded the harmony group the Del-Fi's, which recorded a demo but failed to secure a recording contract.<ref name="AMG"/> Hyland was eventually signed by [[Kapp Records]] as a solo artist and released his debut [[Single (recording)|single]], "Rosemary", in late 1959.<ref name="AMG"/> The label employed the [[Brill Building]] songwriting duo of [[Lee Pockriss]] and [[Paul Vance]] to work with Hyland on the follow-up, "Four Little Heels (The Clickety Clack Song)", which was a minor hit, and the songwriting duo continued to work with Hyland.<ref name="AMG"/>

In August 1960, at the age of 16, Hyland scored his first and biggest hit single, "[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]", written by Vance and Pockriss.<ref name="itsy">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5387834.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Itsy Bitsy writer 'death' error|date=September 28, 2006}}</ref> It was a [[novelty song]] that reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart (No.&nbsp;8 in the UK) and sold almost a million copies in the first two months of its release and over two million copies in total.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Nothing Itsy Bitsy about a Hit |magazine=[[Life magazine|Life]] |date=August 22, 1960 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40 }}</ref><ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/125 |page=125|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url-access=registration}}</ref>
[[File:Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini - Billboard ad 1960.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, June 20, 1960]] 
Hyland moved on to [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount Records]], where he began working with the songwriting and production team of Gary Geld and [[Peter Udell]], and further hits followed with "Let Me Belong to You" and "I'll Never Stop Wanting You".<ref name="AMG"/> In 1961, aged 17, he appeared as himself on the March&nbsp;6 episode of the game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''. He received three votes.<ref>{{cite web|title=To Tell The Truth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKwCbHlIjs4|archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/jKwCbHlIjs4|archive-date=2021-12-12|url-status=live|website=[[YouTube]]| date=May 24, 2017 |publisher=CBS Television|access-date=August 31, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

His other major hit during this period was 1962's "[[Sealed with a Kiss]]", which reached No.&nbsp;3 in 1962 on both the American and [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Another 1962 hit was "[[Ginny Come Lately]]", which reached No.&nbsp;21 on the U.S. chart and No.&nbsp;5 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Hyland's 1962 Top 30 hit "Warmed-Over Kisses (Leftover Love)" incorporated elements of [[country music]]; he continued in that crossover vein with singles including "I May Not Live to See Tomorrow" and "I'm Afraid to Go Home" and on the 1964 album ''Country Meets Folk''.<ref name="AMG"/> This approach was out of step with the changes in the pop music market brought about by [[British Invasion]] bands. Hyland's commercial success declined, but he had further hits with "[[The Joker Went Wild]]" and "Run, Run, Look and See", working with producer [[Snuff Garrett]] and [[session musician|session]] musicians including [[J. J. Cale]] and [[Leon Russell]].<ref name="AMG"/>

Hyland appeared on national television programs such as ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'', and toured both internationally and around America with [[Dick Clark]] in the ''[[Caravan of Stars]]''. The caravan was in [[Dallas]], Texas, on the day of the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBEwdnlDam4|archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/DBEwdnlDam4|archive-date=2021-12-12|url-status=live|title=American Bandstand 1963 -All Time Hits Day- A Little Bit Of Soap, The Jarmels|date=November 10, 2018 |access-date=June 12, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In response to the event, Hyland wrote the song "Mail Order Gun", which he recorded and eventually released on his 1970 eponymous album.<ref name=Quinn>{{cite web |first=Jane |last=Quinn |url=https://www.beat-magazine.co.uk/2019/share-a-cuppa-tea-with-jane-and-brian-hyland/ |title=Share a cuppa tea with Jane and Brian Hyland |website=Beat Magazine |date=November 15, 2019 |access-date=September 25, 2024 |type=interview }}</ref>
 
From 1963 through 1969, Hyland scored several minor hits, but none reached higher on the U.S. pop chart than No.&nbsp;20 ("[[The Joker Went Wild]]").<ref name="Awards">{{cite web|title=Brian Hyland - Awards|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-hyland-mn0000516202/awards|website=AllMusic|access-date=8 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807232111/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-hyland-mn0000516202/awards|archive-date=August 7, 2012}}</ref> An album released in 1964 featured numbers that hearkened back to the 1950s, including such hits as "Pledging My Love" and "Moments to Remember"—at a time when The Beatles and other British Invasion acts were drowning out American artists. Hyland afterward shifted into a phase of recording country and [[folk rock]] styles. Songs such as "I'm Afraid to Go Home" and "Two Brothers" had an [[American Civil War]] theme. Hyland played the [[harmonica]] on a few numbers.

Hyland attempted several departures from the norm, including the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] single "Get the Message" (No.&nbsp;91 on the U.S. pop chart) and "Holiday for Clowns" (No.&nbsp;94),<ref name="Awards"/> but despite their more contemporary arrangements, they failed to receive much [[airplay (radio)|airplay]]. He went on to chart just two more top&nbsp;40 hits, both cover versions: "[[Gypsy Woman (The Impressions song)|Gypsy Woman]]", a 1961 hit for [[the Impressions]] written by [[Curtis Mayfield]], and "[[Lonely Teardrops]]", a 1959 hit for [[Jackie Wilson]]. Hyland recorded both in 1970, and [[Del Shannon]] produced the tracks.<ref name="Pareles">{{cite book|author1=Pareles, Jon|author2=Romanowski, Patty|year=1983|title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll|publisher=Rolling Stone Press|isbn=978-0-671-43457-1|page=267}}</ref> "Gypsy Woman" reached No.&nbsp;3 on the 1970 U.S. pop chart, making it the second-biggest hit of his career, selling over one million copies and being [[music recording sales certification|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in January 1971.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/280 280]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/280}}</ref> Two of his previous hits, "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini" and "Sealed with a Kiss", were also awarded gold discs.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

In 1975, "Sealed With A Kiss" became a hit again in the UK (No.&nbsp;7)<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and Hyland performed the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on July 31 of the same year. By 1977, he and his family had settled in [[New Orleans]], and in 1979 the ''In a State of Bayou'' album, on which he had worked with [[Allen Toussaint]], was issued by the [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] label.<ref name="AMG"/>

In June 1988, Dutch singer [[Albert West]] asked Hyland to record with him some duets of Hyland's hits: "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini", "Sealed With A Kiss", and "[[Ginny Come Lately]]". West had covered the last of these in 1973, scoring a huge European hit, his biggest. Their duet of "Itsy Bitsy&nbsp;..." was released as a single and reached No.&nbsp;43 on the Dutch singles chart. Hyland and West performed on TV shows in Germany and Belgium and a Dutch TV special in Aruba.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brianhyland.tumblr.com/TheArtist|title=Brian Hyland|access-date=March 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406023516/http://brianhyland.tumblr.com/TheArtist|archive-date=April 6, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Sixty years after the release of "Sealed with a Kiss", Hyland reunited with Peter Udell, who invited him to record "A Little Bit of Christmas Time". It was released on Solar Music in late 2023.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://essentiallypop.com/epop/2023/12/the-essential-advent-calendar-december-12-sixties-hitmaker-brian-hyland-releases-sealed-with-a-kiss-60th-anniversary-single-along-with-a-little-bit-of-christmas-time/ |title=The Essential Advent Calendar – December 12: Sixties Hitmaker Brian Hyland Releases 'Sealed With A Kiss' 60th Anniversary Single Along With 'A Little Bit of Christmas Time' |date=December 12, 2023 |website=Essentially Pop |access-date=September 24, 2024 }}</ref>

In 2021 Hyland married Kathalynn Turner Davis, an actress, writer, and psychotherapist.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/OfficialBrianHyland/posts/me-and-my-new-wife/334180488267799/ |first=Brian |last=Hyland |title=Me and my new wife |date=May 21, 2021 |type=personal photo |website=[[Facebook]] |access-date=September 24, 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://kathalynnturnerdavis.com/author |title=About Kathalynn Turner Davis |website=Kathalynn Turner Davis.com |access-date=September 25, 2024 }}</ref> His former wife Rosmari co-wrote songs and performed with him as a back-up singer and percussionist; their son, Bodi, was their drummer.<ref name=interview>{{cite web |first=Gary |last=James |url=http://www.classicbands.com/BrianHylandInterview.html |title=Gary James' Interview with Brian Hyland |website=Classic Bands |access-date=September 24, 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Violanti |url=https://www.villages-news.com/2014/08/28/hyland-proves-hes-one-hit-wonder-show-thursday-night-katie-belles/ |title='Yellow Polka Dot Bikini' hitmaker shows he's got more in closet |newspaper=Villages-News |date=August 28, 2014 }}</ref> 

Hyland's cousin Mabel Hyland was the wife of [[Larry Fine]] of The Three Stooges.<ref name=Quinn/>

==Catalog consolidation==
From 1960 to 1977, Hyland recorded a total of eleven albums for several different record companies. A twelfth album, ''Young Years'', was a reissue. They included [[Leader Records (US)|Leader Records]], [[ABC-Paramount Records]], [[Philips Records]], [[Dot Records]] and [[Uni Records]]. Over the years, these record labels were consolidated and the recordings are now controlled by [[Universal Music]]. Universal has yet to release a CD [[compilation album|compilation]] that includes all of Hyland's charted singles, invariably omitting a handful of minor singles that made the Billboard Top 100 (or the Bubbling Under chart).

*1967 – Leader Records ("Itsy Bitsy&nbsp;...") owner [[Kapp Records]] sold to [[MCA Records|MCA, Inc.]] and becomes co-owned with Uni Records ("Gypsy Woman").
*1974 – Dot Records ("Tragedy") sold to ABC Records ("Sealed with a Kiss")
*1979 – MCA Records buys ABC Records
*1998 – MCA parent Universal Music buys Philips Records ("[[The Joker Went Wild]]") owner [[PolyGram]] completing the catalog consolidation
