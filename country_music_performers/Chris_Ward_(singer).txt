'''Chris Ward''' (born June 27, 1960 in [[The Bronx]]<ref name="whitburn"/>) is an American [[country music]] singer. A former [[police officer]] and bull rider, Ward signed to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1994. After recording [[demo (music)|demos]], he wrote [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1995 single "See Ya".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mansfield|first1=Brian|last2=Graff|first2=Gary|title=MusicHound country: the essential album guide|year=1997|publisher=Visible Ink|url=https://archive.org/details/musichoundcountr0000mans|url-access=registration|quote=chris ward see ya.}}</ref>

Ward released his debut single "Fall Reaching" in 1996. Written by [[Robert Ellis Orrall]] and [[Josh Leo]], and originally recorded by Orrall in the duo [[Orrall & Wright]], the song received a favorable review from ''Billboard'', whose Deborah Evans Price said that it "should go a long way toward helping Ward get through the clutter of competition at country radio."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=10 August 1996|title=Reviews|magazine=Billboard|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgcEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22chris+ward%22+%22Fall+reaching%22&pg=PA47-IA6}}</ref> The song spent two weeks on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, peaking at number 68.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=446|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>

Stroud and [[Dann Huff]] co-produced Ward's debut album ''One Step Beyond''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Flippo|first=Chet|date=29 June 1996|title=Giant's Chris Ward traded his police badge for singing career|magazine=Billboard|pages=28, 30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgkEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22chris+ward%22+%22Fall+reaching%22&pg=PA28}}</ref> This album included the song "[[Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You)]]", co-written by [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]]. Eric Zehnbauer of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a mostly-negative review, saying that it "shows too much of the cookie-cutter sameness that has plagued the recent 'hat act' stampede." Zehnbauer's review praised "Fall Reaching" and the up-tempo songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=547|title=''One Step Beyond'' review|last=Zehnbauer|first=Eric|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> "When You Get to Be You" was covered by [[Lisa Brokop]] on her 1998 album [[When You Get to Be You|of the same name]].
