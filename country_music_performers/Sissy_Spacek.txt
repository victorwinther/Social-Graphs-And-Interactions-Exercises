At the age of six, Spacek performed on stage for the first time in a local talent show.<ref name="biography.com" /> Although her birth name was Mary Elizabeth, she was always called Sissy by her brothers, which led to her nickname. She attended [[Quitman High School (Texas)|Quitman High School]].<ref name="biography.com" />

Spacek was greatly affected by the 1967 death of her 18-year-old brother Robbie from [[leukemia]], which she has called "the defining event of my whole life."<ref name = "Toronto Star-Ouzounian-2012-04-27">

Spacek initially aspired to a singing career. Under the name Rainbo, she recorded a 1968 single, "John You Went Too Far This Time", the lyrics of which chided [[John Lennon]] for his and [[Yoko Ono]]'s nude album cover for ''[[Two Virgins]]''. When sales of her music sputtered, she was dropped by her record label. Spacek switched her focus to acting, enrolling at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]].

==Career==

===1970–1975: Early roles and breakthrough===
She worked as a photographic model (represented by [[Ford Models]]) and as an extra at [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[The Factory|Factory]]. She appeared in a non-credited role in his film ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'' (1970). With the help of her cousin, actor [[Rip Torn]], she enrolled in [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[Actors Studio]] and later the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York.

Spacek's first credited role was in ''[[Prime Cut]]'' (1972), in which she played Poppy, a girl sold into sexual slavery.<ref name="tca" /> The role led to television work, including a 1973 guest role on ''[[The Waltons]]'', which she played twice. She received international attention for her breakthrough role in [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[Badlands (movie)|Badlands]]'' (1973); she played Holly, the film's narrator and 15-year-old girlfriend of [[serial killer]] Kit ([[Martin Sheen]]).<ref name="tca" /> Spacek has described ''Badlands'' as the "most incredible" experience of her career.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2002/oscars_2002/1802501.stm |title=Sissy Spacek's shy career|website= BBC.co.uk | date=February 7, 2002}}</ref> Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' called it a "cool, sometimes brilliant, always ferociously American film" and wrote, "Sheen and Miss Spacek are splendid as the self-absorbed, cruel, possibly psychotic children of our time."<ref name="nyt73canby">{{cite web| title= Badlands | work= NYT Critics' Pick | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173EB42CA6494CC0B7799F8C6896 | publisher= The New York Times | first= Vincent |last= Canby | author-link= Vincent Canby| date= October 15, 1973| access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> On the set of ''Badlands'', Spacek met art director [[Jack Fisk]], whom she married in 1974.<ref name="biography.com">{{cite web |title=Sissy Spacek |work=Bio |url=http://www.biography.com/people/sissy-spacek-9542445 |access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> She worked as the set dresser for [[Brian De Palma]]'s film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' (1974).

=== 1976–1980: ''Carrie'' and film stardom ===

Spacek's most prominent early role came in De Palma's film ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976) playing [[Carrie White]], a shy, troubled high school senior with [[telekinetic]] powers.<ref name="tca" /> Spacek had to work hard to persuade de Palma to cast her in the role.<ref name=tca/> After rubbing [[Vaseline]] in her hair and donning an old [[sailor dress]] her mother had made for her as a child, she turned up at the audition with the odds against her, but won the part.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.briandepalma.net/carrie/carrint.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921090150/http://www.briandepalma.net/carrie/carrint.htm |title=Brian De Palma.net |archive-date=September 21, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Spacek's performance was widely praised and led to a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: "Though few actresses have distinguished themselves in gothics, Sissy Spacek, who is onscreen almost continuously, gives a classic chameleon performance. She shifts back and forth and sideways: a nasal, whining child; a chaste young beauty at the prom; and then a second transformation when her destructive impulses burst out and age her. Sissy Spacek uses her freckled pallor and whitish eyelashes to suggest a squashed, groggy girl who could go in any direction; at times, she seems unborn–a fetus. I don't see how this performance could be any better; she's touching, like Elizabeth Hartman in one of her victim roles, but she's also unearthly—a changeling."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kael |first=Pauline |date=November 15, 1976 |title=Brian De Palma's "Carrie," Reviewed |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/11/22/the-curse |magazine=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>

After ''Carrie'', Spacek played the small role of housekeeper Linda Murray in [[Alan Rudolph]]'s ensemble piece ''[[Welcome to LA]]'' (1976) and cemented her reputation in independent cinema with her performance as [[Pinky Rose]] in [[Robert Altman]]'s classic ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977). A review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "In this film Miss Spacek adds a new dimension of eeriness to the waif she played so effectively in ''Carrie''."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/11/archives/altmans-3-women-a-moving-film-shelley-duvall-in-memorable-role.html|title=Altman's '3 Women' a Moving Film; Shelley Duvall in Memorable Role|first=Vincent|last=Canby|date=April 11, 1977|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Altman was deeply impressed by her performance: "She's remarkable, one of the top actresses I've ever worked with. Her resources are like a deep well." De Palma said: "[Spacek is] a phantom. She has this mysterious way of slipping into a part, letting it take over her. She's got a wider range than any young actress I know."<ref>{{Cite magazine| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911902-1,00.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120181330/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911902-1,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 20, 2013 | magazine=Time | title=Show Business: Basic Spacek: Keeping Life Tidy | date=December 6, 1976 | access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Spacek helped finance ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), [[David Lynch]]'s directorial debut, and is thanked in the film's credits.

Spacek began the 1980s with an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' (1980), in which she played country music star [[Loretta Lynn]], who selected her for the role.<ref name=tca/> In addition to the Academy Award, she also won [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress|the NYFCC Award]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress|LAFCA Award]], [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress|NSFC Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actress. Both she and [[Beverly D'Angelo]], who played [[Patsy Cline]], sang their characters' vocals themselves in the film.<ref name=tca/> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] credited the movie's success to "the performance by Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn. With the same sort of magical chemistry she's shown before, when she played the high school kid in ''Carrie,'' Spacek at 29 has the ability to appear to be almost any age on screen. Here, she ages from about 14 to somewhere in her 30s, always looks the age, and never seems to be wearing makeup."<ref>{{Cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=January 1, 1980 |title=''Coal Miner's Daughter'' |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800101/REVIEWS/1010310/1023 |access-date=June 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Andrew Sarris]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote: "Sissy Spacek—yes, I'm flabbergasted—is simple and faithful as Lynn.

She sings the songs herself, nicely, and she has mastered the Appalachian accent."<ref>Andrew Sarris, ''Village Voice''. ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' review. March 10, 1980</ref> Spacek also was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for singing on the film's soundtrack album. She followed the recording with her own country album, ''Hangin' Up My Heart'' (1983); the album spawned one hit single, "Lonely But Only For You," a song written by [[K. T. Oslin]], which reached No. 15 on the ''Billboard'' Country chart.<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Music Yearbook (1983)'' {{ISBN|978-0-898-20163-5}} p. 154</ref>

In the film ''[[Heart Beat (film)|Heart Beat]]'' (1980), Spacek played [[Carolyn Cassady]], who&mdash;under the influence of [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]'s [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Nick Nolte]]'s [[Neal Cassady]]&mdash;slips into a combination of drudgery and debauchery.<ref>{{cite book|last= Cassady |first= Carolyn |author-link= Carolyn Cassady |title= Heartbeat: My Life with Jack and Neal |date= July 1976 |publisher= Creative Arts Book Company |isbn= 978-0916870034}}</ref><ref name="allmovie1">{{cite web|last=Brenner |first=Paul |url=https://allmovie.com/work/heart-beat-21876 |title=Heart Beat &gt; Overview |website=AllMovie |access-date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Spacek was so adamant about getting the role that she pored through over 4,000 pages of research to prepare for her character. Producer Ed Pressman and director [[John Byrum]] took her to dinner to advise her that she did not have the role. Spacek was so distraught at the news that she shattered a glass of wine in her hand. After that, Pressman walked up to her with a piece of shattered glass and told her she had the role. He said that Spacek breaking the glass clinched the deal, and they believed she ultimately would best suit the part.<ref>{{cite news|title=From a nymphette to weirdo|work=The Montreal Gazette|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w2UxAAAAIBAJ&pg=3134%2C3920202|date=November 19, 1979|access-date=December 21, 2015}}</ref> The film was released on April 25, 1980, to mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/heart_beat/|title=Heart Beat (1980) at Rotten Tomatoes|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=December 21, 2015}}</ref> Ebert called her performance "wonderfully played" and her scenes with Heard and Nolte "almost poetic."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/heart-beat-1980|title=Heart Beat movie review & film summary (1980) |first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com}}</ref>
