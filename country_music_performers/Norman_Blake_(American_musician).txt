He listened to old-time and country music on the radio by [[the Carter Family]], the [[Skillet Lickers]], [[Roy Acuff]], and the Monroe Brothers ([[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]] and [[Bill Monroe]]).<ref name="ND">{{cite web|title=Norman & Nancy Blake - The old-fashioned way|url=https://www.nodepression.com/norman-nancy-blake-the-old-fashioned-way/|website=No Depression|access-date=20 May 2019|date=1 January 2006}}</ref> He learned guitar at age 11 or 12, then [[mandolin]], [[dobro]], and [[fiddle]] in his teens. When he was 16, he dropped out of school to play music professionally.<ref name="Stone">{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Steven|title=Norman Blake|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/2902/norman-blake/|website=Vintage Guitar|access-date=26 November 2016|date=12 December 2003}}</ref>

In the 1950s, Blake joined the Dixieland Drifters and performed on radio broadcasts, then joined the Lonesome Travelers. When he was drafted in 1961, he served as an Army radio operator in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. He started a popular band known as the [[Fort Kobbe|Kobbe]] Mountaineers.<ref name="Stambler">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Stambler|first2=Lyndon|title=Folk and blues : the encyclopedia|date=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312200579|pages=34–35|edition=1}}</ref> A year later, while he was on leave, he recorded the album ''Twelve Shades of Bluegrass'' with the Lonesome Travelers.<ref name="Wolff">{{cite web|last1=Wolff|first1=Kurt|title=Norman Blake {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/norman-blake-mn0000387352/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref>

===Nashville and Johnny Cash===
After being discharged from the Army, Blake moved to Nashville and became a [[studio musician]].<ref name="Stambler" /> For ten years, he toured and recorded with country singer [[Johnny Cash]]<ref name="Wolff" /> and continued to play with Cash  intermittently over the next thirty.<ref name="Stone" /> He met Nancy Short, a cellist with a [[classical music]] background who was playing in a folk group. He was asked by [[Bob Dylan]] to play on the country-folk album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'', then became a member of the house band on Johnny Cash's TV show.<ref name="ND" /><ref name="Stambler" /> [[Kris Kristofferson]], one of the guests, hired Blake to tour with him. Blake recorded with folk singer [[Joan Baez]] and appeared on her hit song "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]".<ref name="Wolff" /> In 1971, he became a member of the bluegrass group Aero-plain, led by multi-instrumentalist [[John Hartford]] with fiddler [[Vassar Clements]], a short-lived project.<ref name="Stambler" /><ref name="Wolff" />

Blake also played dobro on the 1972 album ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]].<ref name="circle">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/will-the-circle-be-unbroken-mw0000193505/credits |title=Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Credits |website=AllMusic |access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref>

In 1972, Blake recorded his first solo album, ''[[Home in Sulphur Springs]]'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1972).<ref name="Wolff" /> Soon after his debut, he and Nancy recorded their first album, ''[[The Fields of November]]'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1974), with Nancy on hillbilly cello. They married in 1975 and performed together for twenty years.<ref name="ND" /><ref name="Stambler" />

===Style===
Most of the music that Norman Blake plays could be described as neo-traditionalist Americana folk and roots music (folk, bluegrass, country, blues), and many of the songs he plays are [[Traditional music|traditional]], but he plays this acoustic type of music with a style, speed, and quality that has evolved and progressed in the modern age. Though probably best known for his fluid renditions of classic fiddle tunes transcribed for the guitar ("Fiddler's Dram/Whiskey Before Breakfast"), Blake has also written songs that have become bluegrass and folk standards, such as "Ginseng Sullivan", "Slow Train through Georgia", "Billy Gray", and "Church Street Blues".

Blake has also written and published songs of a political nature, such as "Don’t Be Afraid of the Neo-Cons."<ref name=":0" />

Blake is known for his tastefully simple-sounding style, saying, "I’m more interested in the music and the tone than I am the licks."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Phil |date=2007-11-21 |title=Interview: Norman Blake |url=https://www.fretboardjournal.com/features/interview-norman-blake/ |access-date=2022-11-28 |website=Fretboard Journal |language=en}}</ref>

Although known as one of the most prominent steel-string guitar [[flatpicking|flatpickers]], Blake is a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist. Other instruments he plays include the [[mandolin]], [[Guitjo (six-string)|6-string banjo]], [[fiddle]], [[dobro]], [[banjo]] and [[viola]].<ref>CD liner notes from ''The Fields of November'', Flying Fish Records, 1992</ref> He is known for his loose, right-hand guitar technique, which arose out of his mandolin technique. Also well known is his devotion to 12-fret guitars, including Martin 00s, 000s, D18s, D28s, and Gibsons, like his 1929 12-fret Nick Lucas special.

=== Collaborations ===
Blake has collaborated with [[Tony Rice]] on the albums, "Blake and Rice," and "Blake and Rice 2," which include many tunes, including some of Blake's originals.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Rice |title=Blake & Rice |date=1992 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Blake-Rice-Tony-Norman/dp/B0000002HV |publisher=Rounder |language=English |access-date=2022-12-06 |last2=Norman Blake |last3=Norman Blake & Tony Rice}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Rice |title=Blake & Rice 2 |date=1992 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Blake-Rice-2-Norman-Tony/dp/B0000002JB |publisher=Rounder |language=English |access-date=2022-12-06 |last2=Norman Blake |last3=Norman Blake & Tony Rice}}</ref> Blake also released an album with Mike Compton called, "Gallop to Georgia," which showcases many Old-Time tunes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mike Compton |url=https://www.mikecompton.net/ |access-date=2022-12-06 |website=Mike Compton |language=en-US}}</ref>
