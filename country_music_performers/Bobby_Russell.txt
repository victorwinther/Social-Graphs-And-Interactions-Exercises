'''Robert L. "Bobby" Russell''' (April 19, 1940 &ndash; November 19, 1992) was an American singer and songwriter. Between 1966 and 1973, he had five [[single (music)|singles]] on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the crossover pop hit "Saturday Morning Confusion". Russell was married to singer and actress [[Vicki Lawrence]] from 1972 to 1974.

==Career==
Russell wrote hits over several genres. His most notable songs were "[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]", his critique of country justice (a No. 1 hit for his then-wife [[Vicki Lawrence]]),<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2|pages=365}}<!--|access-date=October 6, 2009--></ref> "Used to Be" (sung by Lawrence) and "As Far As I'm Concerned" (sung by Russell) both from the 1970 film ''[[The Grasshopper (1970 film)|The Grasshopper]]''; and "[[Little Green Apples]]", which won a Song of the Year [[Grammy Award]] in 1968. "Little Green Apples" was originally recorded and released by [[Roger Miller]], who had the first Top 40 hit with the song. It was also a hit for [[O.C. Smith]] and [[Patti Page]] in the US in 1968. The song was a particular favorite of [[Frank Sinatra]]. Russell wrote the song "[[Honey (Bobby Goldsboro song)|Honey]]", which was a hit for [[Bobby Goldsboro]] in 1968, spending five weeks at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Pop Singles Chart]].

Russell wrote the ballad "Do You Know Who I Am", which was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]] during his 1969 Memphis sessions. Russell penned "[[The Joker Went Wild]]", a Billboard Top 40 hit for [[Brian Hyland]] in 1966. Russell also wrote "Anabell of Mobile" for [[Nancy Sinatra]]. The Russell composition "Camp Werthahekahwee", an ode to summer camps sung by a father to his son, appeared on a 1986 album by [[Ray Stevens]]. The name of the camp is pronounced "where the heck are we?"

===As a performer===
As a singer, Russell's biggest chart success was his self-penned "Saturday Morning Confusion", a top 25 country hit and No. 28 pop hit in the early fall of 1971. The song was a first-person account of a family man suffering from a hangover and trying to find peace and quiet to sleep it off, but constantly being henpecked by the kids, wife and neighbors.  Also penned and sung by Russell was 1974's "Go Chase Your Rainbow", his highest-charting entry in Australia.

Other songs that Russell recorded were "Better Homes and Gardens", "1432 Franklin Pike Circle Hero", "For a While We Helped Each Other Out", "Our Love Will Rise Again", "How You Gonna Stand It", and "Mid American Manufacturing Tycoon". He also wrote and recorded "Summer Sweet" for the Disney live-action ''[[Rascal (film)|Rascal]]'' in 1969 and wrote and sang the title song "As Far as I'm Concerned" over the opening credits of ''The Grasshopper''.

==Death==
Russell died in [[Nicholasville, Kentucky]], of [[coronary artery disease]] on November 19, 1992. He was 52 years old.<ref name="whitburn"/>
