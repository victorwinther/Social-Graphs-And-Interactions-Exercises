==Background==
===2018–2019: Formation and debut===
Gone West was formed in 2018 and is composed of Colbie Caillat, Justin Kawika Young, Nelly Joy, and her husband Jason Reeves,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sawyer|first=Bobbie Jean|date=June 12, 2020|title=Gone West Delivers Sun-Soaked Country on Debut Album 'Canyons'|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/gone-west-canyons/|access-date=June 23, 2020|website=Wide Open Country|language=en-US}}</ref> and was formed following the four touring together in support of Caillat's ''[[The Malibu Sessions]]''. The band is based out of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and gets its name from the fact that its four members all hail from states (Reeves from Iowa, Joy from Texas, Caillat from California, and Young from Hawaii) west of Tennessee,<ref name="musicrow"/> which was the inspiration for the band's "autobiographical theme song" and titular track "Gone West."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8493961/gone-west-colbie-caillat-confetti-premiere|title=Hear 'Confetti,' the Uplifting Track from Colbie Caillat's New Band, Gone West: Premiere|author=Melinda Newman|date=January 17, 2019|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=June 18, 2019}}</ref> All of its members had previous experience in the music industry as recording artists and songwriters: Caillat as a Grammy-winning folk pop artist, Young as an artist in the [[Music of Hawaii|contemporary Hawaiian music]] scene, Reeves as a songwriter of some of Caillat's biggest hits and an indie artist, and Nelly Joy as one half of country duo [[the JaneDear girls]].
