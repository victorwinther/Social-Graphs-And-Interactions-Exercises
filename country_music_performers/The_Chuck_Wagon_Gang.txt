'''The Chuck Wagon Gang''' is a [[Country gospel]] musical group, formed in 1935 by David P. ("Dad") Carter, oldest son Ernest ("Jim") along with daughters Lola ("Rose") and Effie ("Anna").<ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref> The group got their first radio break as sponsored singers for Bewley Flour in 1936.<ref>Rick Marsehall ''Encyclopedia of Country and Western Music'' 1990 Page 33 "Soon thereafter, Bewley Flour lost their sponsored singers on the station, the Chuck Wagon Gang, and the Carters were asked to assume the role. The year was 1936, "</ref> The "Gang" signed with [[Columbia Records]] and remained with them for 39 years, a world record that lasted until 2000, when [[Johnny Mathis]]' overall time with the same label (combining his signing in 1957 and re-signing in 1968) entered its 40th year. At one point they were Columbia's number one group with over 39 million in record sales.<ref name="titleThe Renaissance Center - Home - News - Chuck Wagon Gang 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=The Renaissance Center - Home - News - Chuck Wagon Gang 2003 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=The Renaissance Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=2012-08-10 }}The Chuck Wagon Gang's Start</ref>

The Chuck Wagon Gang has performed at [[Carnegie Hall]], the [[Hollywood Bowl]], and the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. The group has been inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s classic American recordings.<ref name="titleThe Renaissance Center - Home - News - Chuck Wagon Gang 2003"/>

==1930s to 1970s== 
The group was founded in 1935 broadcasting from radio station [[KFYO (AM)|KFYO]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]], and took the name in 1936 when they moved to [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]] in [[Fort Worth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sghistory.com/index.php?n=C.Chuck_Wagon_Gang|title=Southern Gospel History - C / ChuckWagonGang|website=sghistory.com}}</ref>  The original members sang together all the way to 1955 when Dad Carter retired, later passing away in 1963, followed by Jim in 1971.  Sons Eddie and Roy Carter stepped in to sing tenor and bass, respectively, which began the tradition of Carter siblings, children, and eventually grandchildren joining the Gang.

By the mid-1970s, the group was still touring part-time but felt a lack of support from the label they had recorded for during the previous three decades.  Columbia had stopped servicing their songs to radio; thus, airplay had become non-existent. The decision was eventually made to move on from Columbia in the interest of rebuilding the group to a position akin to what it had enjoyed in years past. To that end, in 1979 they began recording for Copperfield Records and remained with that label for several years. <ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref>

==1980s to Present Day==
After its relationship with Copperfield Records ended, the Chuck Wagon Gang began recording for Associated Artists.  It was during this era that the group took advantage of its renewed popularity and, in keeping with the gospel sounds of the time, added a piano player to the lineup for live concerts.  Fans responded positively to this sound, eventually culminating in the Gang receiving the "Best Gospel Group in Country Music" award at the Music City News Awards in 1988. <ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref>

Roy approached Anna's granddaughter Shaye in 1993, asking her to assume the responsibility of singing soprano upon the retirement of member Debbie Trusty.  Shaye accepted Roy's offer and sang soprano with the Gang until the retirement of alto singer Ruth Ellen Carter Yates a few years later, when she moved to her current position of alto singer.   Roy subsequently retired, bringing about a new era for the Gang in which none of Dad Carter's children were members.  As the 21st century dawned, the Gang sought to return to its origins, paring its sound back to the beautiful simplicity of four-part harmony accompanied by a single guitar.  Once again, fans responded positively.  As of 2024, the Gang records for Crossroads Label Group. (Source: {{cite web |url=https://thechuckwagongang.net/ |title=Official Website}})
