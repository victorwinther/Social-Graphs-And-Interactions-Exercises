'''Doyle Floyd Hendricks''' (June 30, 1936 – January 13, 2007), known by the stage name '''Doyle Holly''', was an American musician best known as the [[bass guitar]] player of the [[country music]] band [[Buck Owens]] and [[the Buckaroos]] and for his solo hit songs "[[Queen Of The Silver Dollar]]" and "Lila". Holly's contributions on [[bass guitar]] and [[rhythm guitar]] were a key component of the [[Bakersfield sound]]. The Buckaroos had more than 30 [[Top 40]] [[single (music)|singles]] on the country music charts in the 1960s and early 1970s, with 21 number one hits such as "[[I've Got a Tiger By the Tail]]," "Love's Gonna Live Here,"and "[[Act Naturally]]." Their sound influenced later artists such as [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[The Eagles]], [[The Derailers]] and the [[Desert Rose Band]].

==Early life==
Holly was born in [[Perkins, Oklahoma|Perkins]], Oklahoma. As a young man, he spent four years in the [[United States Army]]<ref name="rcnv3">{{cite web| last =Morrison| first =Bill| title =Rockabilly Country News & Views| publisher =Rockabilly Hall of Fame| date =September 2005| url =http://www.rockabillyhall.com/rcnv3.html| access-date =2007-05-26| archive-date =2016-03-03| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221401/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/rcnv3.html| url-status =dead}}</ref> and worked in oil fields in [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and [[California]].<ref name="cst">{{cite web|last =Johnson| first =Jon| title =Doyle Holly and the Buckaroos are together again| work =CountryStandardTime.com| publisher =Jeffrey Remz|date=June 2003|url =http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?fn=doyleholly.asp|access-date =2007-05-25}}</ref> He eventually made his way to [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California, where he discovered the country and rock music scene in the area. He began to play guitar and bass in local clubs at night while working in the oil fields during the day. In the early 1960s Holly played with [[Johnny Burnette]],<ref name="musicweb">{{cite encyclopedia| last =Clarke| first =Donald| title =Buck Owens| encyclopedia =MusicWeb Encyclopedia of Popular Music| url =http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/o/O48.HTM| access-date =2007-05-26 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095606/http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/o/O48.HTM <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-09-29}}</ref> toured the [[rodeo]] circuit with a pre-''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' [[Jack Lord]],<ref name="cst" /> and appeared with several country and rock bands and artists.

==The Buckaroos==
Holly was playing with [[Joe Maphis]] in 1963 when he was asked by [[Don Rich]] to fill in as bassist for the Buckaroos.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Randy |title=Doyle Holly, bass player for Buck Owens' Buckaroos |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 17, 2007 |url=http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=330691 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191714/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=330691 |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> The spot became his permanently after [[Merle Haggard]] left the group,<ref name="latimes" /> and the Buckaroos began their most creative and successful period, from 1963 to 1971. The group had more than 30 singles in the country music top 40 in that time, of which more than half went to No.&nbsp;1. "[[Act Naturally]]," a No.&nbsp;1 single for the Buckaroos in 1963, was [[cover version|covered]] by [[The Beatles]] on their 1965 album ''[[Help!]]'' <ref name="cst" /> Other hits included "I've Got A Tiger By The Tail," "[[Together Again (Buck Owens song)|Together Again]]," and "Love's Gonna Live Here," which occupied the top position on the country chart for 17 weeks near the end of 1963.<ref name="cst" /><ref name="latimes" />

The Buckaroos recorded a live album, [[Carnegie Hall Concert (Buck Owens album)|Carnegie Hall Concert]] in 1966, which Holly said was his favorite recording as a Buckaroo. At the time, it was only the second album recorded at [[Carnegie Hall]] by a country music group, and it is widely regarded as one of the best live albums in country music history.<ref name="cst" />

The concert had been oversold and the venue was packed with fans, many sitting in the aisles. During the Carnegie Hall concert, the Buckaroos returned a favor to [[The Beatles]] and played "[[Twist and Shout]]" while wearing Beatles wigs.<ref name="cst" />

Holly and the Buckaroos toured widely in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] in the 1960s. During the band's peak of popularity in the mid to late 1960s, it seemed like everyone was a Buckaroos fan including [[the Beatles]], who, it is said, had a standing order for all new Buck Owens and the Buckaroos records to be forwarded to them in England.<ref name="cst" />
While on tour in London in 1969, Holly, Owens and Don Rich met up [[John Lennon]] and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="cst" />
Holly recorded seven albums with [[The Buckaroos]] from 1968-1970 without Buck Owens, all of which were chart topping records. The Buckaroos albums contained instrumentals along with Holly and [[Don Rich]] sharing the role of lead vocalists, each having solo songs on every album. The band won a number of awards, including [[Grammy]]s and [[Country Music Association|CMA]]s (Country Music Awards). While Holly was with [[The Buckaroos]] they were nominated as "Band Of The Year" seven consecutive years from the [[Academy of Country Music]] from 1965 to 1971, winning the award four years in a row from 1965-1968. They were also nominated as "Instrumental Group of the Year" for five consecutive years from 1967-1971 by the Country Music Awards, winning twice in 1967 and 1968.<ref>[http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/database/ArtistDetail.aspx?artistId=764 Country Music Awards entry for The Buckaroos.]</ref>

In 1968, [[Buck Owens]] and [[the Buckaroos]] recorded a live album when they performed at the White House for President [[Lyndon Johnson]]. They served as the house band for the American [[television]] [[variety show]] ''[[Hee Haw]]'', and for Owens' syndicated television show, ''Buck Owens Ranch House'', from 1966 to 1972.<ref name="oms">{{cite web |title=Doyle Holly dies in Nashville |work=OMS News |publisher=OMS Records |date=January 2007 |url=http://www.omsrecords.com/articles.php?tPath=7 |access-date=2007-05-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430071223/http://www.omsrecords.com/articles.php?tPath=7 |archive-date=2007-04-30 }}</ref> Holly was nominated several times as "[[Bass Player of the Year]]" award from the [[Academy of Country Music]], and he received the award in 1970.<ref>{{cite news| title =1970 6th Academy of Country Music Awards| work =The Envelope| publisher =[[Los Angeles Times]]| url =http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1970/1970acma.htm| access-date =2007-05-26 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106203940/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1970/1970acma.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-01-06}}</ref>

In 1971, Holly left the Buckaroos, stating, "(I) went just as far as I could go" with the Buckaroos.<ref name="cst" /> He formed a band called the Vanishing Breed and signed with [[Andy Williams]]' label [[Barnaby Records]].<ref name="musicweb" /> He recorded two albums and some of his own songs, such as "Woman Truck Drivin' Fool", "Queen of the Silver Dollar", and "Lila".<ref name="oms" />  Seven singles hit the country music charts, of which "Lila" made the most successful peak at No.&nbsp;17 in 1973.<ref name="cst" /> Holly continued to record and release singles throughout the 1970s and scored a minor hit with "A Rainbow in My Hand" and a jukebox hit "Richard and the Cadillac Kings."<ref name="rhof1">{{cite web| last =Mack| first =Bill| title =Buck Owens and the Buckaroos Band Mate| work =Rockabilly Hall of Fame| publisher =Rockabilly Music Preservation| url =http://www.rockabillyhall.com/DoyleHolly1.html| access-date =2007-05-26| archive-date =2007-08-07| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070807053020/http://rockabillyhall.com/DoyleHolly1.html| url-status =dead}}</ref> Holly is honored in the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]<ref name="rhof1"/> and received a block in the Walkway of Stars at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walkway of Stars |publisher=[[Country Music Hall of Fame]] |url=http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/support-join-walkway-stars.aspx |access-date=2007-05-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510073536/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/support-join-walkway-stars.aspx |archive-date=2007-05-10 }}</ref>

In 2000 Owens, Holly, [[Johnny Russell (singer)|Johnny Russell]], and the remaining Buckaroos (Rich died in a motorcycle accident in 1974) began to record a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-influenced album of Buckaroo hits, with Holly on vocals.

Holly was hospitalized in December 2006 for treatment of end-stage [[prostate cancer]].
