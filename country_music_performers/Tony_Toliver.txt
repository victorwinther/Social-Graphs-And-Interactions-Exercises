'''Charles Anthony Taliaferro''' (born July 4, 1955 in [[Richards, Texas]]) is an American [[country music]] singer.

Taliaferro began playing [[bass guitar]] in his family's gospel group, but later began playing piano. He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] at age 25 and held day jobs, until he was discovered by singer [[Dottie West]]. West hired him and had him as her pianist and bandleader, with his first gig occurring at the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/tony-toliver-p1844/biography|title=Tony Taliaferro biography|last=Campbell|first=Al|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref>

Taliaferro continued to tour with his bandmates, The Lloyds, after West died in 1991, and released a self-titled debut album through [[Curb Records]] the same year. Six years later, he released a second album, ''Half Saint, Half Sinner'' through [[Rising Tide Records]]. This album included two singles that made the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: "Bettin' Forever on You" and "He's on the Way Home".
