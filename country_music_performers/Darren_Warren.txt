==Personal life==

"There are things that come at you that are stumbling blocks.," Warren said. "If we can take them and make them stepping stones, we can help more people and do things to change people's lives."
In August 2011, Darren Warren celebrated a milestone: 10 years in remission from non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.  "Going back to St. Jude with my guitar to meet the patients and sing songs like "Old McDonald Had a Farm" might sound small to a lot of people, but to me, that's what it's all about."<ref>The Huffington Post (2012).

Darren Warren now regards the diagnosis he received as a teenager a blessing-in-disguise.  Warren's life-threatening experience was a life-changing catalyst that propelled him into the future pursuing his dream as a country music artist. Warren never lacked inspiration during his time in the hospital. Incredibly, it was during treatment that he wrote almost every song that would be recorded on his debut CD.

"There were times when I sat down and told my guitar how I felt, and I realized I had created a song," Warren remembers.

The title track "Cowboy Up and Party Down" (written by Eddie Kilgallon) was released as his first single and distributed to country music radio stations in May 2011. A poignant song Warren wrote for the album, "Go Get My Angel," deals with the loss of a young victim to cancer. Randy Owen of the Country Music Hall of Fame band Alabama is featured as a guest artist on the song. It is a fan favorite that has provided inspiration to many families struggling with grief.<ref>Skates, Sarah (September 22, 2011). "Darren Warren Working Debut EP". Music Row.
