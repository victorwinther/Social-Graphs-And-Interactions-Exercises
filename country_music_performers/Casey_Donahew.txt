== Career ==
Donahew began writing songs in high school, and credits past relationships as inspiration behind much of his early work, stating:

{{blockquote|Once you get your heart broken for the first time, you've got a lot to say, I guess.<ref name="caseydonahewband1">{{cite web|url=http://www.caseydonahewband.com/?pg=bio|title=Casey Donahew Band - Bio|publisher=Caseydonahewband.com|accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref>}}

Eventually, he broke into the world of Texas Country, which was gaining popularity with Pat Green, Robert Earl Keen and Randy Rogers. Casey's approach to songwriting is different from typical country music artists, as he often writes about heartbreak with a unique twist on the subject, as well as his experiences in different locations across the state, most notably the Stockyards of Fort Worth.

Donahew began playing professionally in 2002 by booking mostly bar gigs and building a dedicated fanbase among younger crowds.<ref name="caseydonahewband1"/> He gained notoriety online and on airwaves throughout Texas, and reached the Top 30 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart with the album ''Moving On'', released in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/298775/casey+donahew/chart |title=Casey Donahew - Chart history |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-27 |archive-date=2015-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108204627/http://www.billboard.com/artist/298775/casey+donahew/chart |url-status=dead }}</ref>
