===''Hardin County Line'' and ''Born and Raised in Black & White''===
Collie began his career on [[MCA Records]] in 1989 after being discovered by label representatives. [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], then-president of the label, helped Collie secure his contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.douglascorner.com/overtheyears/mark_collie.php|title = Mark Collie -New on the Charts|location = Douglas Corner Cafe, Nashville|access-date = January 9, 2013}}</ref> His debut album ''[[Hardin County Line]]'' was released in 1990,<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1561|pure_url=yes}}|title=Mark Collie biography |access-date=2008-09-15 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> with Brown and [[Doug Johnson (record producer)|Doug Johnson]] co-producing. The album produced four singles: "Something With a Ring to It", "Looks Aren't Everything", the title track, and "[[Let Her Go (Mark Collie song)|Let Her Go]]", which was the highest-charting of the four, at #18 on [[Hot Country Songs]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=99|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Its [[B-side]], "Where There's Smoke", was later a Top 40 single for [[Archer/Park]] in 1994.

After those two songs, "Shame Shame Shame Shame" and "Something's Gonna Change Her Mind" both made top 30 as well.<ref name="whitburn"/> [[Brian Mansfield]] wrote that the album was "At once a move to the mainstream and a return to Collie's West Tennessee rockabilly roots."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mark-collie-mw0000095051|title=''Mark Collie'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|work=Allmusic|access-date=October 16, 2013}}</ref>
