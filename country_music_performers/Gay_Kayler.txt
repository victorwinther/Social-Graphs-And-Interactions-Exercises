'''Gay Kayler''' (born 27 September 1941) is an [[Australian country music]] entertainer - a vocalist, television personality, recording artist, pianist, triple beauty quest title holder, model, scriptwriter and educator. Gay used her maiden name in her professional career until 1978, when she changed the spelling from Kahler to Kayler to maintain a consistency of pronunciation. She retired in 1998.

==Early life==
Gay Kayler comes from a musical family. Her mother sang and played piano, piano accordion and violin with her siblings in their father's dance band on the [[Darling Downs]], Queensland, in the 1930s.<ref>Gay Gets Around, ''The Australian Women's Weekly'', 14 November 1962</ref>

In 1942, the Kayler family moved to Sydney, where Gay continued this musical tradition when, at the age of two-and-a-half, she captivated commuters on Sydney's trams and buses as she sang for them.<ref>Gay Kahler: Her 'gimmick' is that she can sing, ''The Secretaries and Managers Journal'', May 1973</ref>

In the early 1950s, Gay sang on one of the first reel-to-reel tape recorders in Australia – as part of its demonstration at the [[Sydney Royal Easter Show]].

After attaining her certificate for 7th Grade Piano, Theory and Musical Perception, Gay and her family moved to [[Toowoomba, Queensland]]. It was there that Gay made her first professional performance in 1958.

Gay Kayler's reputation blossomed when she was chosen to sing the Alexandra Waltz for [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] during her 1959 visit to Australia.<ref>Gay song for a princess, ''Woman's Day'', 7 January 1963</ref> The Fairy Princess wanted to hear more so, by royal command, the teenager sang a selection of songs. Ultimately, this led to Gay being contracted to [[Brisbane]]'s [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] for 3 years, where she appeared in shows such as the multi-Logie-Award-winning [[Theatre Royal (Australian TV series)|Theatre Royal]] with [[George Leonard Wallace|George Wallace Jnr]].<ref>The Singing Moods of TV's Gay Kahler, ''TV Week'', 17 October 1964</ref> [[File:Gay Kayler the entertainer.jpg|thumb|Gay Kayler the entertainer]]

== Television and live performances ==
Gay's 40-year professional showbusiness career included appearances on most national TV shows, e.g. [[Brian Henderson (television presenter)|Brian Henderson]]'s [[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]], [[Johnny O'Keefe]]'s Sing, Sing, Sing and [[Graeme Bell]]'s Trad Jazz.<ref>Trad Jazz, ''TV Week'', 20 October 1962</ref> She performed eight times in the main Concert Hall of the [[Sydney Opera House]], including on the first all-Australian Country Music Concert<ref>Australian Festival of Performing Arts, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 November 1973</ref> and the first all-Australian Variety Show held in that iconic venue. Gay also featured her Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal Song, ''Captain Joe Henry's Happy Hand-Clapping, Open Air Rhythm Band'', backed by a 300-voice choir and huge Salvation Army band, when she opened and closed a 1976 concert in that venue.<ref>Salvos get rhythm, ''The Courier Mail'', 28 June 1976</ref>

Other notable venues included [[Melbourne]]'s [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]], [[Adelaide]]'s Chrysler Auditorium and the 1,500 strong NSW Registered Club Circuit, said to be the biggest entertainment circuit in the world in its day.

== Production shows ==
Gay Kayler combined a major part of her career with Australian country music star, Johnny Ashcroft, whom she married in 1981.[[File:Johnny Ashcroft & Gay Kayler getting a laugh.jpg|thumb|Johnny Ashcroft and Gay Kayler in a comedy routine]]  Although they created a reputation as a show-stopping duo, they still retained their individuality by incorporating solo highlights within their performances.

Their production shows, such as ''The Imagine That! Australiana Show'', ''Here's To You, Australia!'', ''The Goodtime Gotcha Show'' and ''Everything But The Drover's Dog'', often included comedy segments with Gay and Johnny as themselves, and also as their alter egos, The Baron and Lady Finflingkington (The Baron's consort), who sang disco.

Parallel with their adult production shows, Gay Kayler and Johnny Ashcroft spent eleven years presenting Australian history to more than 750,000 school children with songs, stories and visuals in their NSW Education Department accredited shows.

In 2004, Gay and Johnny were adopted into the Gamilaraay Nation by Gamilaraay elder, Centennial Medal holder and United Nations keynote speaker, Barbara Flick, because of their 'ground-breaking' presentations of Australia's First Nations people, both traditional and present day, and for their stance against racism.[[File:Johnny Ashroft & Gay Kayler Australiana show.jpg|thumb|Johnny Ashcroft & Gay Kayler in their Australiana show]][[File:Gay Kayler Hands of Fame.jpg|thumb|Gay Kayler in the Australian Country Music Hands of Fame]]

==Special Recognition==
In 1981, Gay Kayler received the ''Queensland Country Music Awards'' national trophy for ''Service to Australia's Country Music Industry''.

Gay Kayler was imprinted in the ''Australian Country Music Hands of Fame'' in 1994.

==Legacy==
''The Johnny Ashcroft and Gay Kayler Legacy Collection'' was presented to the ''Australian Country Music Hall of Fame'' in Tamworth (Gamilaraay Country) on 28 May 2022, with a Welcome to Country and Smoking Ceremony.

Nine Hundred and seventy-seven items, plus seventy-nine recordings, a variety of posters and eighteen recorded backgrounds joined their artefacts already in the Museum. ''Little Boy Lost, the Search, Song, Movie and Beyond'' (one hundred and three items) was part of this impressive Collection.
