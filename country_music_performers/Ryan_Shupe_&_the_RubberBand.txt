The second single from the album, however, failed to chart, and the band was dropped from Capitol.  In 2008, the band signed to [[Montage Music Group]] and released the album [[Last Man Standing (Ryan Shupe & The RubberBand album)|Last Man Standing]].  After this, the band continued to tour nationally and promote their unique brand of music.  In 2010, the band released the album "Brand New Shoes" on their own independent label.  This album has many crowd favorites and highlights the cross-genre, acousti-jam sound they have become known for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanshupe.com/brand-new-shoes |title=Official Ryan Shupe & The Rubberband Lyrics, Tickets and More!

These videos are for the songs The Sun Will Shine Again, We Rode On, and Just Say Yes.

== Formation and ideology ==
Ryan Shupe started playing the fiddle at age 5.<ref name="Country Music Television">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/shupe_ryan/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050606004421/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/shupe_ryan/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 6, 2005 |title=Ryan Shupe & the RubberBand : Biography |publisher=CMT.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> He played in various musical groups growing up starting with a group of talented 10 yr olds called the "PeeWee Pickers" who toured nationally.<ref>[http://blueskymusiccamps.com/Faculty.php Blue Sky Music Camps | Faculty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619001010/http://blueskymusiccamps.com/Faculty.php |date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref> His experiences in bands forming and then breaking up led him to the concept of a "rubber band". It would be elastic in members being able to rotate in and out without a name change or breaking a groove.<ref name="Country Music Television"/> Since their formation they have become one of the most successful musical acts from the state of [[Utah]] among other acts such as [[SHeDAISY]], [[Peter Breinholt]], and [[Neon Trees]]. The band also made an appearance on the show ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' on October 18, 2006, for a family in [[Logan, Utah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shupe.net/news_detail.php?idnum=35 |title=Official Ryan Shupe & The Rubberband Lyrics, Tickets and More!
