'''Dave & Sugar''' was a pop-styled American [[country music]] trio which enjoyed its peak success in the mid- to late-1970s. The trio consisted of [[lead singer]] [[Dave Rowland]] and initially on backing vocals, Vicki Hackeman and Jackie Frantz. Over time, the female members ("Sugar") of the group changed: Frantz was replaced by [[Sue Powell]] in 1977, who in turn was replaced by Jamie Kaye in 1980, while Hackeman was replaced by Melissa Dean ([[Etta Britt]]) in January 1979.<ref name="MusicCityAttractions Dave & Sugar Bio"/> Overall, Dave & Sugar charted 16 times on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, including three No. 1 hits: "[[The Door Is Always Open]]", "[[Tear Time]]" and "[[Golden Tears]]". Powell also had two chart singles outside the group. Dave & Sugar were sometimes called "The country [[ABBA]]" because of their slickly produced sound as well as blend of male and female voices.

==Background==
The trio was founded and fronted by Dave Rowland, born in [[Sanger, California]], raised in [[Los Angeles, California]]<ref name =usatoday>{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/04/country-singer-dave-rowland-leader-dave-sugar-dies/1886354002/|title=Country singer Dave Rowland, leader of Dave & Sugar, dies at 74|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref> (January 26, 1944 – November 1, 2018), while two female vocalists made up the "Sugar" part. The "Sugar" line-up changed several times during the group's run of success, while the two original singers were Jackie Frantz and Vicki Hackeman.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=632/3}}</ref>

Before forming Dave & Sugar, Rowland was part of [[J.D. Sumner]] and the [[Stamps Quartet]] (who was touring with [[Elvis Presley]] at the time), and later the Four Guys.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dave-sugar-rowland-mn0001411997|title=Dave & Sugar biography|last=Brennan|first=Sandra|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=28 February 2010}}</ref> He also was a prominent member of country singer [[Charley Pride]]'s road show.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=115|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> By 1975, with Pride looking for a backup band, Rowland hired Frantz and Hackeman, and Dave & Sugar was formed.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> They signed a deal with [[RCA Records]].

The trio's first single, "Queen of the Silver Dollar" (written by [[Shel Silverstein]], and originally recorded by [[Dr. Hook]] in 1972, and also included on [[Emmylou Harris]]' debut solo album earlier in 1975) broke into the Top 25 of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s country singles chart in early 1976.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Their next single, "[[The Door Is Always Open]]", became their first No. 1 hit in July.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Their peak run garnered nearly one dozen Top 10 singles, including two more No. 1 hits - "[[Tear Time]]" (1978) and "[[Golden Tears]]" (1979).<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Rowland disbanded the trio briefly during the early 1980s to try a solo career,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> releasing an album entitled (appropriately) ''Sugar Free'' and charting two singles of his own.<ref name="whitburn"/> Powell also charted two singles on RCA as a soloist, and later went on to host the TV series ''Nashville on the Road''.<ref>Whitburn, p. 328</ref> Rowland later reformed the trio with two new sets of "Sugar" partners: Cindy Smith and Lisa Alvey, followed by Regina Leigh and Lori Mason.<ref name="allmusic"/> However, these second-era trios failed to gain the popularity the original trios had in the 1970s and the group disbanded for good after only minimal success. In 1997, former Sugar member Leigh formed the short-lived country duo [[Regina Regina]] with partner Regina Nicks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19970305&id=ZZgyAAAAIBAJ&pg=6496,2485489|title=Regina Regina hopes pairing pays off|last=Patterson|first=Jim|date=5 March 1997|work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|access-date=11 April 2013}}</ref>

On November 1, 2018, Rowland died due to complications from a stroke in his Nashville home at the age of 74.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/dave-and-sugar-singer-dave-rowland-dead-stroke/|title=Dave & Sugar Singer Dave Rowland Dead at 74|website=Tasteofcountry.com|date=2 November 2018 |access-date=November 3, 2018}}</ref>
