'''John Rich''' (born January 7, 1974) is an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter. From 1992 to 1998, he was a member of the country band [[Lonestar]], in which he played bass guitar and alternated with [[Richie McDonald]] as lead vocalist.  After departing from the band in 1998, he embarked on a solo career on [[BNA Records]] in the late 1990s, releasing two singles for the label and recording ''[[Underneath the Same Moon]]'', which was not released until 2006. In 2001, he self-released ''Rescue Me'', an album he was inspired to record by a cancer patient named Katie Darnell.  By 2003, he joined [[Big Kenny]] to form the duo [[Big & Rich]], who released three albums on [[Warner Bros. Records]] as well as ten singles, including the Number One "[[Lost in This Moment]]". After Big & Rich went on hiatus in 2007, Rich began work on a third solo album, ''[[Son of a Preacher Man (John Rich album)|Son of a Preacher Man]]'', which has produced two more chart singles. In 2011, Rich released two extended plays, ''[[Rich Rocks]]'' and ''[[For the Kids (EP)|For the Kids]]'', before re-establishing Big & Rich in 2012.
