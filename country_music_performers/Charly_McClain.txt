'''Charlotte Denise''' "'''Charly'''" '''McClain''' (born March 26, 1956)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=248}}</ref> is an American [[country music]] singer, best known for a string of hits during the 1980s. McClain's biggest hits include "[[Who's Cheatin' Who]]", "[[Sleepin' with the Radio On]]", and "[[Radio Heart (Charly McClain song)|Radio Heart]]".

==Early life==
McClain was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], United States,<ref name="AMG">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/charly-mcclain-mn0000772541/biography|title=Charly McClain &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=8 August 2021}}</ref> to Virginia (née Wiggins; 1934–2009) and Niles McClain. The nickname "Charly" would come from the neighborhood friends that she played with as a child.<ref name="AMG"/> McClain used it when she began her career playing hotel [[lobby (room)|lounges]].<ref name="AMG"/> Her first experience recording was when father Niles had [[tuberculosis]] when she was eight.<ref name="AMG"/> As she was under age to comply with [[hospital]] visiting policy, she had to communicate with him through a [[tape recorder]].<ref name="AMG"/> That inspired her interest in recording.<ref name="AMG"/> She began her musical career at age 12 performing with her brother Mike and their band, Charlotte & the Volunteers. The band  performed together for the next six years.

Her first TV appearance was on the local [[WBBJ-TV|WBBJ]] morning show in [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. By the age of 17, she was a regular on the club circuit, and appeared at the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] show ''Mid-South Jamboree'' from 1973–1975.

==Recording career==
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2022}}

===Steady rise===
At the age of 20, McClain signed her first recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1976. McClain's distinct vocal sound provided an edge in recognizability—as did her attractive appearance.<ref name="AMG"/> McClain debuted in late 1976 with her first [[Promotional recording|single]], "Lay Down," which peaked at No. 67 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Chart]]. McClain's initial singles in 1976 and 1977, from her debut [[album]] ''Here's Charly McClain,'' failed to appear highly on the country chart. McClain's second album, ''Let Me Be Your Baby,'' was released in 1978. She hit country's Top Ten for the first time in 1978 with "[[That's What You Do to Me]]," <ref name="AMG"/> followed by two other Top 25 hits, "Let Me Be Your Baby," and "Take Me Back."

In 1979 McClain released ''Alone Too Long'', which included the Top-20 hits "When A Love Ain't Right" and "You're a Part of Me". The ''Women Get Lonely'' album followed in 1980, featuring the Top 10 hit "[[Men (Charly McClain song)|Men]]",<ref name="AMG"/> which peaked at No. 7 in 1980, and the Top-20 duet with [[Johnny Rodriguez]], "I Hate the Way I Love It." However, breakthrough success still eluded McClain.

===Achieving success===
McClain hit No. 1 on the country chart in 1981 with "[[Who's Cheatin' Who]]".<ref name=AOL>{{Cite web |url=http://music.aol.com/artist/charly-mcclain/biography/1001431 |title=Charly McClain biography at AOL.com |access-date=2008-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413194048/http://music.aol.com/artist/charly-mcclain/biography/1001431 |archive-date=2010-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1981, McClain scored three Top-10 hits off her ''Surround Me with Love'' album: the [[Surround Me with Love|title track]], "[[Sleepin' with the Radio On]]", and "[[The Very Best Is You]]".<ref name="AMG"/> McClain's albums were beginning to become more successful as well. Her ''Who's Cheatin' Who'' album peaked at No. 28 on the ''Top Country Albums'' chart, and her 1981 album, ''Surround Me With Love'' went to number 9.

In 1983, McClain hit No. 1 again with her [[Mickey Gilley]] duet "[[Paradise Tonight]]."<ref name="AMG"/><ref name=AOL/> McClain's and Gilley's duet partnership became so successful, they released a duet album the following year titled ''It Takes Believers.'' The record contained the Top-5 hit, "[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]" (No. 5 on the Billboard Country Chart), and the top 20 hit, "The Right Stuff".

McClain also acted; she appeared as a guest star on such shows as ''[[Hart to Hart]]''<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> (in 1981 episode titled "Rhinestone Harts") and ''[[CHiPs]]'' (in 1983 episode "Country Action"). McClain's lonely life on the road was also chronicled in a 1981 [[HBO]] special titled ''So You Want to Be a Star.''

After having a series of hit singles in 1984, McClain released another best-selling album, ''Radio Heart'' in 1985. The album's [[Radio Heart (Charly McClain song)|title track]] became a No. 1 Country hit in 1985; McClain's last No. 1 to date. The album also spawned two other Top-10 hits that year. McClain married former soap star [[Wayne Massey]] in 1984, and their duet "[[With Just One Look in Your Eyes]]" reached number five.<ref name=AOL/> The third single off the album was also a duet with Massey. It was titled "[[You Are My Music, You Are My Song]]". The ''Radio Heart'' album peaked at No. 15 on the ''Top Country Albums'' chart in 1985. In 1986, Charly and Wayne released a duet album ''When Love Is Right'' and the first single "[[When It's Down to Me and You]]" peaked at No. 17.

==Later years==
After 1986, McClain's success began to subside. Her 1987 ''Still I Stay'' album brought only one Top 40 single; "[[Don't Touch Me There]]" peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Country Chart. The album became McClain's last album with [[Epic Records|Epic]]. Upon fulfilling her contract, she parted ways with the record label the following year. She continued to chart until her last recording came in 1989.<ref name="AMG"/>   She recorded one studio album with [[Mercury Records]] before the end of the decade.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Her last charted single was "You Got the Job", which peaked at No. 65. McClain has not recorded a studio album since 1988's self-titled album on Mercury Records.

==Retirement and family==
Preferring to spend more time with her husband and their families, McClain retired completely from touring, public appearances, and performances in the early 1990s. Later, she helped to care for her mother Virginia before she died in 2009.<ref name="Shackelford Funeral Directors">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shackelfordfuneraldirectors.com/obituaries/Virginia-Jo-McClain-5820/|website=Shackelfordfuneraldirectors.com|title=Virginia Jo McClain Obituary|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

Charly McClain and Wayne Massey have no children together. However, Massey does have a son from his first marriage.

Several compilation albums of McClain's music have been released over the years. Probably the most noteworthy of these is 1999's ''Anthology.'' It included all of McClain's successful singles from her career with Epic. She continues to reside with her husband Wayne in the Memphis, Tennessee, area.
