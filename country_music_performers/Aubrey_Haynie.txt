In his career, he has recorded three studio albums for the [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] label, all three of which contained mostly songs that he wrote himself. He also holds several credits as a session fiddler and mandolinist.

==Biography==

===Early influences===
When Haynie was nine, he began taking fiddle lessons from his grandmother's cousin, a man named Ted Locke.  He studied the fiddle, for two years, after which he took up the mandolin. He became exceedingly good at both, and within two years he joined a bluegrass band named the Bluegrass Parlor Band. While he was traveling, he got a chance to meet [[Chubby Wise]], a self-styled "original" [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]], on many occasions. These opportunities enriched his sense of music, and were a great inspiration to him in his younger years.  Another major influence on Haynie's music was that of Kenny Baker, whose fiddle albums were some of his favorites. Those familiar with Baker's fiddle style might recognize similarities in Haynie's sound.

In 1990, at age 16, attending the [[Florida]] fiddling championships, and competing, Haynie won first place in the contemporary division for the second time, playing Wild Fiddler's Rag and [[Les Patineurs (waltz)|Skater's Waltz]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Jeff |last = Klinkenberg |title = FIT AS A FIDDLE Series: DATELINE FLORIDA |work = St. Petersburg Times |date = 1990-06-03}}</ref>

In August 1996 Haynie lost two [[violins]] and a [[Violin bow|bow]], when a lightning-induced fire burnt [[Tim Austin (musician)|Tim Austin]]'s [[Doobie Shea Records|Doobie Shea Studios]] to the ground.<ref>{{cite news |first = Mark |last = Morrison |title = Bluegrass Studio up in Flames |work = Roanoke Times & World News |date = 1996-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Madelyn |author-link=Madelyn Rosenberg |date=1997-07-30 |title=A Year After a Fire at the Doobie Shea Studios, Tim Austin has the Music Miked and Tapes Humming the Bands Play On... |work=Roanoke Times & World News}}</ref>

In 2004 Haynie won the fiddle category at the 39th Annual [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards.<ref>{{cite news |title = Off-Camera Awards Winners Announced for the 39th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards Live Awards Telecast to Be Broadcast From Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas Wednesday, May 26th at 8:00 PM ET/PT on CBS Television Network |publisher = PR Newswire (U.S.) |date = 2004-05-06}}</ref>
