He began his musical career in the late 1930s, performing on radio station [[WJLS (AM)|WJLS]] in [[Beckley, West Virginia]], while attending [[West Virginia University]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Khatchatourian|first1=Maane|title=Little Jimmy Dickens, Oldest Grand Ole Opry Star, Dies at 94|date=January 3, 2015 |url=https://variety.com/2015/music/news/little-jimmy-dickens-oldest-grand-ole-opry-star-dies-at-94-1201391732/|publisher=Variety|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref> On the radio station, he got his experience with performers like Mel Steele, Molly O'Day and Johnnie Bailes.<ref name="HOF"/> In the 1940s, Jimmy hosted his own radio programs in places like [[West Virginia]],  [[Indiana]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Kansas]] and even [[Ohio]]. <ref name="HOF"/> He soon quit school to pursue a full-time music career, traveling the country performing on local radio stations under the name "Jimmy the Kid".

==Career==
[[File:Little Jimmy Dickens 1955.JPG|thumb|left|Dickens in 1955]]
In 1948, Dickens was heard performing on [[WJMK (AM)|WKNX]], a radio station in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], while on location at Buck Lake Ranch, Angola, Indiana. [[Roy Acuff]] introduced him to [[Art Satherley]] at [[Columbia Records]] and to officials from the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name="HOF"/> Dickens signed with Columbia in September and joined the Opry in August. Around this time he began using the nickname Little Jimmy Dickens, inspired by his short stature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little Jimmy Dickens, Oldest Grand Ole Opry Cast Member, Dead at 94|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6429370/little-jimmy-dickens-oldest-grand-ole-opry-cast-member-dead-at-94|publisher=Associated Press via Billboard|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref>

Dickens recorded many novelty songs for Columbia, including "Country Boy", "A-Sleeping at the Foot of the Bed", and "I'm Little but I'm Loud".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mansfield|first1=Brian|title=Country Great "Little" Jimmy Dickens Dies at 94|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/01/02/little-jimmy-dickens-dies/20994825/|work=USA Today|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref> His song "Take an Old Cold Tater (And Wait)" inspired [[Hank Williams]] to nickname him Tater. Later, telling Dickens he needed a hit, Williams wrote "[[Hey Good Lookin' (song)|Hey Good Lookin']]" in only 20 minutes while on a plane with Dickens, [[Minnie Pearl]], and Pearl's husband, Henry Cannon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Masino |first=Susan |date=2011 |title=Family Tradition: Three Generations of Hank Williams |url=https://archive.org/details/familytraditiont00masi |url-access=registration |quote=jimmy dickens hank williams hey good lookin minnie pearl plane. |location=Montclair, New Jersey |publisher=Backbeat Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/familytraditiont00masi/page/67 67] |isbn=978-1-61713-006-9}}</ref> A week later, Williams recorded the song himself, jokingly telling Dickens, "That song's too good for you!",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lavallee|first1=Michelle|title=Little Jimmy Dickens: Country Singer to Opry Legend|url=http://www.axs.com/little-jimmy-dickens-country-singer-to-opry-legend-31404|publisher=AXS|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref> to which Dickens replied, "Much obliged, Hiram."

In 1950, Dickens formed the Country Boys with musicians Jabbo Arrington, [[Grady Martin]], [[Bob Moore (musician)|Bob Moore]], and [[Thumbs Carllile]]. It was during this time that he discovered future Country Music Hall of Famer [[Marty Robbins]] at a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], television station while on tour with the Grand Ole Opry road show. In 1957, Dickens left the Grand Ole Opry to tour with the ''Philip Morris Country Music Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_5943693,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150103214319/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_5943693,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 3, 2015|title=Artists : Artists A to Z : Little Jimmy Dickens Biography : Great American Country|access-date=January 5, 2015}}</ref>

In 1962, Dickens had his first top-10 country hit since 1954 with "The Violet and a Rose".

In 1964, he became the first country artist to circle the globe while on tour. He also made numerous appearances on television, including on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. In 1965, he released his biggest hit, "[[May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose]]", which reached number 1 on the country chart and number 15 on the pop chart.

In the late 1960s, Dickens left Columbia for [[Decca Records]] before moving again to [[United Artists]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com/farewell-little-jimmy-dickens|title=Farewell to 'Little' Jimmy Dickens|date=January 3, 2015 |publisher=uDiscovermusic.com|access-date=January 5, 2015}}</ref> That same year, he married his wife, Mona,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodhomepage.com/little-jimmy-dickens-december-filled-with-milestones-cms-3965#.VKhivyeGrzY|title=Little Jimmy Dickens' December Filled with Milestones|publisher=BrentwoodHomePage.com|access-date=January 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103235221/http://www.brentwoodhomepage.com/little-jimmy-dickens-december-filled-with-milestones-cms-3965#.VKhivyeGrzY|archive-date=January 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masoncountynews.com/news/30164/|title=Grand Ole Opry Stars Little Jimmy Dickens and Darrell McCall At Llano Country Opry: Events|date=May 15, 2010|work=Mason County News|access-date=January 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104003901/http://www.masoncountynews.com/news/30164/|archive-date=January 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and in 1975 he returned to the Grand Ole Opry.

Dickens joined producers [[Randall Franks]] and [[Alan Autry]] for the ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' cast CD ''Christmas Time's A Comin’'', performing "Jingle Bells" with the cast. The CD was released by Sonlite and MGM/UA and was one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.

===Later career===

In 1984, Dickens appeared in [[Hank Williams Jr.|Hank Williams Jr.'s]] music video for the hit single "[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]".

[[File:Little Jimmy Dickens.jpg|thumb|Dickens performing at the [[Grand Ole Opry House]] in 2004. Notice the six-foot circle of oak which was cut from the corner of the [[Ryman Auditorium]]'s stage and inlaid into center stage at the Grand Ole Opry House]]
Toward the end of his life, Dickens made appearances in a number of music videos by fellow West Virginia native and country musician [[Brad Paisley]]. He was also featured on several of Paisley's albums in bonus comedy tracks, along with other Opry mainstays such as [[George Jones]] and [[Bill Anderson (country music)|Bill Anderson]]. They were collectively referred to as the Kung-Pao Buckaroos.

With the death of [[Hank Locklin]] in March 2009, Dickens became the oldest living member of the Grand Ole Opry, at the age of 90. He made regular appearances as a host at the Opry, often with the self-deprecating joke that he was also known as "[[Willie Nelson]] after taxes", playing on his resemblance to Nelson in his later years, [[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?|Nelson's highly publicized problems with the Internal Revenue Service]], and Dickens' own short stature. At the [[2011 Country Music Association Awards|2011 CMA Awards]], Dickens was dressed as [[Justin Bieber]] and made fun of Bieber's then-current [[paternity (law)|paternity]] scandal.

==Personal life==
Dickens married Connie Chapman in 1944; the marriage ended in divorce in 1955. Later that year, he married Ernestine Jones; she died in 1968 in an automobile accident while traveling in Texas.
