Merlo grew up in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]]. Her father was a funk musician, and the house was often filled with music.<ref name=":0" /> She had a desire to be a performer since the first time she sang in front of a crowd of people. In public school, she took part in her school talent show. She sang "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" and after that performance she decided that she wanted to be a singer.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Five Questions With...
