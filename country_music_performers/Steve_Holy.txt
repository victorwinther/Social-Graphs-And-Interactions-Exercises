==Career==
===Early life===
Steve  was born February 23, 1972, in [[Dallas, Texas]], as the youngest of eight children.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p384504|pure_url=yes}} |title=Steve Holy biography |accessdate=2008-06-29 |last=Johnson |first=Zac |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> He entered a local competition called the Mesquite Opry at age 19. While there, he caught the attention of Wilbur Rimes, the father of country singer [[LeAnn Rimes]]. By 1999, Holy was signed to [[Curb Records]].  His musical influences include [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Lionel Richie]].

===1999-2002: ''Blue Moon''===
His first single for the label, Don't Make Me Beg, peaked at No.&nbsp;29 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts in 2000. By October of that year, Holy's debut album, ''[[Blue Moon (Steve Holy album)|Blue Moon]]'', was released.<ref name="allmusic"/> Its second and third singles, which were [[Blue Moon (Steve Holy song)|the title track]] and "The Hunger", respectively, both reached No.&nbsp;24 on the country charts.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1539426/holy-resurfaces-with-brand-new-girlfriend.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927183747/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1539426/holy-resurfaces-with-brand-new-girlfriend.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 27, 2009|title=Holy resurfaces with "Brand New Girlfriend"|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=25 August 2006|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>

Late in 2001, Holy reached Number One for the first time with "[[Good Morning Beautiful (song)|Good Morning Beautiful]],"<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=192|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> a selection from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Angel Eyes (film)|Angel Eyes]]''. This song spent five weeks at Number One on the country charts and reached No.&nbsp;29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="whitburn"/> Blue Moon eventually went [[Gold certification|Gold]] nine years after its release in February 2009.

===2002–2010: Non-album singles and ''Brand New Girlfriend''===
Holy released his fifth single, "I'm Not Breakin'," in late 2002. This song peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on the country music charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> This was followed by four more singles over the next two years: "Rock-a-Bye Heart" at No.&nbsp;37 in 2003, "Put Your Best Dress On" at No.&nbsp;26 in 2004, "Go Home" and "It's My Time (Waste It If I Want To)" at No.&nbsp;49 and No.&nbsp;59, respectively, in 2005.<ref name="whitburn"/> None of these five singles were included on a studio album.<ref name="cmt"/>

In 2005, Holy released "[[Brand New Girlfriend (song)|Brand New Girlfriend]]," co-written by [[Jeffrey Steele]], [[Shane Minor]] and Bart Allmand. This song became Holy's second and to date final Number One on the country charts, and his first since “[[Good Morning Beautiful (song)|Good Morning Beautiful]]” in 2002, reaching the top of the charts in its 36th week and setting a record for the slowest climb to Number One on that chart since the inception of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] in 1990.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929173748/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003122345 Chart Beat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (This record was broken one year later by [[Tracy Lawrence]], whose "[[Find Out Who Your Friends Are]]" reached Number One in its forty-first chart week.) "Brand New Girlfriend" was the lead-off single to Holy's second studio album, also entitled ''[[Brand New Girlfriend]]''. This album also produced the lesser Top 40 country hits "Come On Rain" and "Men Buy the Drinks (Girls Call the Shots)" at No.&nbsp;35 and No.&nbsp;38.<ref name="whitburn"/> Also included on the album were a [[cover version]] of [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s "[[All for the Love of Sunshine]]" and a song co-written by [[United States Senator]] [[Orrin Hatch]].<ref name="cmt"/>

A thirteenth single, "Might Have Been", was released in mid-2008 and on the chart week of December 27, 2008, debuted at No.&nbsp;60 on the Hot Country Songs chart.

===2011–present: ''Love Don't Run''===
In February 2011 Holy released "[[Love Don't Run (song)|Love Don't Run]]". The song became his first Top 20 hit on the country charts since "Brand New Girlfriend" in 2006. Holy's third studio album, also entitled ''[[Love Don't Run]]'', was released on September 13, 2011.  In 2012, Holy released "Radio Up" written by [[Ben Glover]] and Bruce Wallace.  In 2013, he parted ways with Curb Records.
