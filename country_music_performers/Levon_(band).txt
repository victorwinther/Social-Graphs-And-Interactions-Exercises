Jake Singleton met Michael David Hall at a restaurant where Hall was working as a server. 
They began performing together and then added Ryan Holladay as well. 
They eventually chose to name themselves Levon after [[The Band]]'s [[Levon Helm]] and the [[Elton John]] song "[[Levon (song)|Levon]]."<ref name="theboot">{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/levon-columbia-nashville-epic-records/|website=theboot.com|title=Levon Sign With Columbia Nashville and Epic Records|accessdate=2017-10-23}}</ref><ref name="soundslikenashville">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/levon-nashville-favorites/|title=Levon's Nashville Favorites|website=Sounds Like Nashville|date=29 August 2017|accessdate=2017-10-23}}</ref>
