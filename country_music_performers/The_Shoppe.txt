'''The Shoppe''' was an American [[country music]] group from [[Dallas, Texas]], composed of Mark Cathey (vocals), Kevin Bailey (vocals), Roger Ferguson (guitar), Clarke Wilcox (banjo), Mike Caldwell (harmonica), Jack Wilcox (bass), and Lou Chavez (drums).

The band's highest-charting single, "Doesn't Anybody Get High on Love Anymore," reached the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1981.<ref name="google">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&dat=19880817&id=zTcQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_o4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4495,4875509|title=Ellensburg Daily Record - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com}}</ref> They were signed to MTM Records in 1985 and released one album, ''The Shoppe'', which charted on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart and led to appearances on [[The Nashville Network]].<ref name="google" />

For nearly three decades, The Shoppe toured extensively throughout the United States before disbanding in 1998.
