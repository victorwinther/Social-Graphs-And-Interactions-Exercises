'''Curtis Blaine Wright''' (born June 6, 1955) is an American [[country music]] artist. He first played in the 1970s and 80s as a member of the [[Super Grit Cowboy Band]] before becoming a solo artist in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Wright charted three singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] between 1990 and 1993. He has also recorded as a member of [[Orrall & Wright]], [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], and [[Pure Prairie League]]. In addition to these, Wright holds several credits as a songwriter, including the number one singles "[[A Woman in Love (Ronnie Milsap song)|A Woman in Love]]" by [[Ronnie Milsap]], "[[Next to You, Next to Me]]" by Shenandoah, and "[[What's It to You]]" by [[Clay Walker]].

==Biography==

Curtis Blaine Wright was born June 6, 1955, in [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=407|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref>

Initially a member of a band known as the Country Generation, succeeded by the [[Super Grit Cowboy Band]], Wright later performed as a backup vocalist and guitarist for [[Vern Gosdin]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p31126|pure_url=yes}} |title=Curtis Wright Biography |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In December 1989, he quit Gosdin's band and wrote [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s number one single "[[A Woman in Love (Ronnie Milsap song)|A Woman in Love]]".<ref>{{cite book |last=Roland |first=Tom |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits |year=1991 |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=0-8230-7553-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/billboardbookofn0000rola/page/572 572] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/billboardbookofn0000rola/page/572 }}</ref> Wright signed with Airborne Records in 1989 and released "She's Got a Man on Her Mind", which charted at number 38 on [[Hot Country Songs]]. (A version of the same song by [[Conway Twitty]] charted one year later.) Wright was also slated to release an album titled ''Slick Hick'' in March 1990, which would have been produced by himself and Jeff Carlton.<ref>{{cite journal|date=December 1, 1989|title=New Artist Fact File|journal=[[Radio & Records]]|page=56|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-12-01.pdf}}</ref> However, the album went unreleased due to financial issues with the label.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&dat=19900221&id=M3tPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vlEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5574,5524109|title=Record label can't release artist's song|last=Lewis|first=Jim|date=February 21, 1990|work=The Bryan Times|publisher=UPI|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}</ref>

Later in the same year, he co-wrote [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]]'s "[[Next to You, Next to Me]]" with [[Robert Ellis Orrall]], and [[Steve Wariner]]'s top 20 hit "[[There for Awhile]]". In 1992, Wright signed to [[Liberty Records]], where he released his [[Curtis Wright (1992 album)|self-titled debut album]] that year. This album produced two more low-charting singles. It also included the song "[[What's It to You]]", which Wright also co-wrote with Orrall. Although Wright's version was never released as a single, [[Clay Walker]] later recorded this song on his 1993 [[Clay Walker (album)|debut album]], and his version was a number one hit that year. He also co-wrote Shenandoah's 1992 single "[[Rock My Baby]]".<ref name="pat">{{cite web |url=http://www.pattersonandassociates.com/bios/Shenandoah/index.html |title=Shenandoah |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |work=Patterson & Associates |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201002334/http://www.pattersonandassociates.com/bios/Shenandoah/index.html |archive-date=February 1, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also in 1992, Wright co-wrote a song with fellow country singer [[Dennis Robbins]] and musician [[Warren Haynes]] which would become the title track of Robbins first [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]] album called "Man With A Plan", for which Wright also provided backing vocals. By 1994, Wright joined Orrall to form [[Orrall & Wright]], a duo which charted two singles, recorded one album for [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]] and received a Duo of the Year nomination from the [[Country Music Association]] before disbanding.<ref name="allmusic"/> Wright later wrote [[Daryle Singletary]]'s 1996 single "[[Too Much Fun (song)|Too Much Fun]]".

After the departure of their former lead singer Brent Lamb (who, in turn, replaced [[Marty Raybon]]) in the late 1990s, Shenandoah chose Wright as their third lead singer.<ref name="trib">{{cite web |url=http://www.tribstar.com/features/local_story_144192938.html |title=Shenandoah to perform at Fairbanks Park festival |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |last=Bennett |first=Mark |date=May 2, 2007|work=Terre Haute Tribune-Star |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130205054144/http://www.tribstar.com/features/local_story_144192938.html |archivedate=February 5, 2013 }}</ref> Wright left Shenandoah in 2007 to join [[Reba McEntire]]'s band and Jimmy Yeary succeeded him. He also toured as a member of [[Pure Prairie League]] in the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.thepilot.com/September2004/09-24-04/092404RaiseRoof.html |title=Raise the Roof 5: Pure Prairie League Ready for Show |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |last=Smith |first=Stephen |date=May 2, 2007|work=The Pilot |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817191404/http://archives.thepilot.com/September2004/09-24-04/092404RaiseRoof.html |archive-date=August 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
