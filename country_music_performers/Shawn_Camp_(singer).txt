Camp recorded a second album for Reprise, but never released it due to creative differences. He then began writing for other artists. Camp's first Number One as a songwriter came in early 1998, when [[Garth Brooks]] reached the top of the ''Billboard'' country charts with "[[Two Piña Coladas]]", a song co-written by Camp.<ref name="allmusic"/> Later in the same year, [[Brooks & Dunn]] reached Number One with "[[How Long Gone]]", another Camp co-write.<ref name="camp"/><ref name="pdf">{{cite web |url=http://ohboy.com/media/shawncamppublicity.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=ohboy.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040919173438/http://ohboy.com/media/shawncamppublicity.pdf |archive-date=19 September 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Camp released ''Lucky Silver Dollar'' in 2001.<ref name="camp"/> In 2006, he was nominated as Songwriter of the Year by the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music; also, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked him No.10 on their 2006 list of Hot Country Songwriters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cowboyjackclement.com/shawn_camp/ |title=Shawn Camp and Jack Clement |website=www.cowboyjackclement.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108012231/http://www.cowboyjackclement.com/shawn_camp/ |archive-date=8 November 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the same year, two songs co-written by Camp entered the country charts: "[[Nobody But Me (Blake Shelton song)|Nobody But Me]]" by [[Blake Shelton]], and "[[Would You Go with Me]]" by [[Josh Turner]], which peaked at No.4 and No.1, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' U.S. [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.

Since early 2007, Camp had been collaborating with country legend [[Loretta Lynn]] writing songs such as "I'm Dyin' for Someone to Live For" and "I'm More Alone When I'm With You" together. Camp has featured some of the photographs taken at the Cash Cabin Studios in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]] which many believe means he is going to be duetting on some of Lynn's upcoming albums.
