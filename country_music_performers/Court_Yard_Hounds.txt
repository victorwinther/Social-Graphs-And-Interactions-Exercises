'''Court Yard Hounds''' were an American [[country music]] and [[Folk music|folk]] duo, founded by sisters [[Martie Maguire]] and [[Emily Robison]]. They, along with [[Natalie Maines]], make up [[The Chicks]], formerly the Dixie Chicks. The sisters decided to record a side project under a different name. Court Yard Hounds, featuring Robison for the first time as lead vocalist, released a debut album for [[Columbia Records]], the same label for which the Dixie Chicks has recorded, on May 4, 2010. The album debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart, initially selling 61,000 copies. It has sold approximately 825,000 copies in the United States.<ref>[http://www.theboot.com/2010/05/12/zac-brown-band-pass-the-jar-charts/ Zac Brown Band Pull Double-Duty on Country Chart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227045047/http://www.theboot.com/2010/05/12/zac-brown-band-pass-the-jar-charts/ |date=February 27, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/lady-antebellum-zac-brown-band-miranda-lead-charts-this-wek |title=Lady Antebellum, Zac Brown Band & Miranda Lead Charts This Week &#124; New Country Music, Listen to Songs & Video |publisher=Roughstock.com |date=May 12, 2010 |access-date=February 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224084940/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/lady-antebellum-zac-brown-band-miranda-lead-charts-this-wek |archive-date=December 24, 2013 }}</ref>

==Career==
===Dixie Chicks===
{{Main|Dixie Chicks}}
Emily and Martie Erwin, now Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, founded the [[Dixie Chicks]] in 1989 with Robin Lynn Macy (lead vocals) and [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]]. They released two independent albums before Macy left, and their third album was released with Lynch on lead vocals.  In 1995, Lynch left and was replaced by [[Natalie Maines]].  The group was then signed to [[Monument Records]] and released two hit albums, before departing from Monument in 2000 and founding their own label, Open Wide Records, in association with [[Columbia Records]]. They then released their third album [[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]] to critical acclaim. During a London concert ten days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], lead vocalist Maines stated, " Just so you know, we're on the good side with y'all, we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas" (the trio's home state). The statement offended their core fan base who thought it rude and unpatriotic, and the ensuing controversy cost the group half of their concert audience attendance in the United States and led to accusations of the three women being un-American, as well as hate mail, death threats, and the public destruction of their albums in protest.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.today.com/popculture/dixie-chicks-shut-sing-toronto-wbna14822593 |title=Dixie Chicks 'Shut Up and Sing' in Toronto |date=September 13, 2006 | publisher=Today.com |access-date=October 8, 2006}}</ref>  The group followed a small hiatus with a live album and a documentary highlighting the maelstrom  created by Maines' comment entitled ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]''. The Dixie Chicks released ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' in 2006 which has since sold over 3 million copies and ultimately won five [[Grammy Awards]]. The Dixie Chicks were on hiatus from 2008 until in 2016 they reformed for a world tour.
