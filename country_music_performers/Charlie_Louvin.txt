'''Charles Elzer Loudermilk''' (July 7, 1927 &ndash; January 26, 2011), known professionally as '''Charlie Louvin''', was an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. He is best known as one of [[the Louvin Brothers]], and was a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] since 1955.<ref name="opry-louvin">{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artists/l/Louvin_Charlie.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113161939/http://www.opry.com/artists/l/Louvin_Charlie.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 13, 2010|title=Charlie Louvin|publisher=[[Gaylord Entertainment]]|access-date=2011-01-26}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Section, Alabama]], Louvin was one of seven children and grew up working on the family farm in nearby [[Henagar, Alabama|Henagar]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |last=Frisckis-Warren |first=Bill |date=2011-01-26 |title=Charlie Louvin, Country Singer, Dies at 83 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/music/27louvin.html?mcubz=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City |access-date=2017-08-18}}</ref> He started singing when he was eight years old.<ref name="raisedcountry">{{cite interview|last=Louvin|first=Charlie|subject-link=Charlie Louvin|title=Country Music Hall of Famer, Charlie Louvin, Takes Us from 1927 to 2010|url=http://raisedcountry.com/charlie_louvin|year=2010|access-date=2010-03-07|archive-date=2010-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210020321/http://raisedcountry.com/charlie_louvin/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Louvin began singing professionally with his brother [[Ira Louvin|Ira]] as a teenager on local radio programs in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The boys sang traditional and [[gospel music]] in the harmony style they had learned while performing in their church's choir.<ref name="Wolfe">{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Charles K.|title=In Close Harmony: The Story of the Louvin Brothers|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jtIc-4A6nYC&q=satan+is+real+louvin+brothers&pg=PA91|isbn=978-0-87805-892-1}}</ref>

After Charlie left the act briefly in 1945 to serve in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]],<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/singer-charlie-louvin-dies-83-76372/ Singer Charlie Louvin Dies at 83.] ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. Retrieved May 6, 2021.</ref> the brothers moved first to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] and later to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], working as postal clerks by day, while making appearances in the evening. Another brief disbandment due to Charlie's service in the [[Korean War]] led to the brothers' relocation to [[Birmingham, Alabama]].<ref name = "Wolfe" />

Primarily known as gospel artists, the [[Louvin Brothers|Louvins]] were convinced by a sponsor, "you can't sell tobacco with gospel music," and began adding secular music to their repertoire. They began making appearances on the famed ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' during the 1950s, becoming official members in 1955. The Louvin Brothers released numerous singles, such as "When I Stop Dreaming", with over 20 recordings reaching the country music charts. Their rich harmonies served as an influence for later artists, such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gram Parsons]], and [[The Byrds]].<ref name="CST">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jon|title=Livin' Lovin' Losin' the Louvin's Way|publisher=Country Standard Time|date=October 2003|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=943|access-date=January 22, 2010}}</ref>

By the 1960s, Charlie and Ira's popularity had waned and the brothers split up in 1963. In 1965, Ira was killed in a car accident. Charlie continued to perform solo, making numerous appearances on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' and in later years acting as an elder statesman for country music.<ref name="CST" />

In 2001, the Louvin Brothers were inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Louvin Brothers Induction to Country Music Hall of Fame|publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/the-louvin-brothers-|access-date=January 22, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130051332/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/the-louvin-brothers-|archive-date=January 30, 2011}}</ref>

In the 2000s, Charlie had begun rebuilding<!-- {{according to whom|date=January 2011}} --> his career. Although he readily admitted he was never much of a writer, Louvin released a disc of classics containing one new song, a tribute to Ira, and a gospel album on [[Tompkins Square Records]] produced by Mark Nevers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gerome|first=John|title=An 81-year-old's country music career resurgence|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|page=39|date=2009-02-25}}</ref> The songs mainly pair Louvin with other singers, such as [[George Jones]], [[Jeff Tweedy]] of [[Wilco]], [[Alex McManus]] of [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Elvis Costello]] and Derwin Hinson. He also wrote two songs with Rockabilly Hall of Famer [[Colonel Robert Morris]], one of which is on Morris' trucking CD, ''Highway Hero''.

{{As of|2003}}, Louvin lived in [[Manchester, Tennessee]].<ref>[http://www.talentondisplay.com/TakeNote/059.html A Country Collection: We're Louvin It. Hoekstra, Dave. November 30, 2003.] Retrieved January 22, 2010.</ref> He closed his Louvin Brothers museum in Nashville and was looking to open another one in [[Monteagle, Tennessee]], near [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]. He was a cousin of songwriter [[John D. Loudermilk]].

After his July 2010 cancer surgery, Louvin made his first public appearance, and second to last, at Nashville's [[Americana Music Festival & Conference|Americana Music Conference]], Sept. 10th. He performed with Emmylou Harris and longtime Harris and Gram Parsons accompanist Al Perkins on [[steel guitar]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/seeing-charlie-louvin-for-the|title=Seeing Charlie Louvin for the last time|work=No Depression|publisher=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]|access-date=2012-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808183523/http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/seeing-charlie-louvin-for-the|archive-date=2012-08-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Louvin made one final public appearance on [[RFD-TV]]'s ''The Marty Stuart Show'', alongside his son, Sonny Louvin. He performed "See the Big Man Cry", after which country music icon [[Connie Smith]] spoke of her admiration for Louvin, before performing "[[I Don't Love You Anymore]]". [[Leroy Troy]], alongside Lester Armistead and Dan Kelly, then performed "Bald Knob, Arkansas", which was written by Charlie's brother, Ira Louvin. [[Marty Stuart]] and his Fabulous Superlatives then performed the Louvin Brothers gospel song "The Family Who Prays". The show then closed with Louvin singing the [[Tom T. Hall]] song "Back When We Were Young", with Stuart accompanying him on mandolin.
The show aired on January 29, 2011, three days after Louvin's death. The show ended with a memorial message: 
"This episode was taped on December 2, 2010. It was to be Mr. Louvin's last televised performance."

Louvin underwent surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]] on July 22, 2010. Doctors expected a full recovery,<ref>{{cite web|last=Talbott |first=Chris |title=Country Music Hall of Famer Charlie Louvin has pancreatic cancer, scheduled for surgery |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 8, 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/sns-ap-us-music-charlie-louvin-cancer,0,5489292.story |access-date=July 13, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic|fix-attempted=yes}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> but "the surgery did not go as planned," according to Louvin's son Sonny, and "he will begin using alternative methods of treatment, going forward".<ref>[http://charlielouvin.net/2010/08/update-on-charlies-surgery/ Charlie Louvin's Cancer Inoperable.
