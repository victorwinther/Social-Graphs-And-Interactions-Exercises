Brent made his vocal debut at age 7 when he sang [[Tim McGraw]]'s "[[Don't Take the Girl]]" with his father's band in a [[Richland, Georgia]] festival performance.

As a teenager, Cobb fronted a local band called Mile Marker 5 which had some regional success and opened for larger stars.<ref name="CS">{{cite news | last=DeYoung| first=Bill| title =5 questions: Brent Cobb | newspaper =Connect Savannah| date =January 8, 2013 | url =http://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/5-questions-brent-cobb/Content?oid=2175613| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref> At age 16, Cobb met his cousin, [[Dave Cobb]], at a family funeral.

==Career==

Cobb recorded his debut album, ''No Place Left to Leave'', in 2006 with his cousin while in Los Angeles. However, after some time in this period, he decided to return to Georgia.

Country star and acquaintance [[Luke Bryan]] suggested Cobb move to [[Nashville]] which, in turn, he eventually did in 2008. Initially, Cobb worked as a photo developer at [[Walgreens]] but eventually managed to negotiate a songwriting contract with Carnival Music Publishing within the year.<ref name="BB"/>

After obtaining his songwriting contract, Cobb then went on to write a variety of songs for many prominent stars, such as Luke Bryan's "Tailgate Blues", [[David Nail]] and [[Frankie Ballard]]'s "Grandpa's Farm", Kellie Pickler's "Rockaway", Kenny Chesney's "Don't It", Miranda Lambert's "Old Sh!t", as well as numerous other performers.<ref name="CMT"/><ref name="Boot"/><ref name="SMN">{{cite news | last=Sickler| first=Linda| title =Georgia songwriter Brent Cobb goes from Willie Nelson to stage of his own| newspaper =[[Savannah Morning News]]| date =January 10, 2013 | url =http://savannahnow.com/do/2013-01-10/georgia-songwriter-brent-cobb-goes-willie-nelson-stage-his-own| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref>

==Musical style==

Cobb's musical style has been described as "blue collar country"<ref name="CMT"/> with "[[Bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]]-leaning inclinations."<ref name="RS">{{cite news | last=Moss| first=Marissa R.| title =See Brent Cobb Record Folksy 'Down Home' With Producer Cousin Dave Cobb| work =[[Rolling Stone]]| date =March 23, 2016 | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-brent-cobb-record-folksy-down-home-with-producer-cousin-dave-cobb-20160323| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref> Some have noted that his sound is closer to Americana than contemporary country music. Jon Freeman of the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' described Cobb's voice as "soft and sweet, with surefooted hints of soul."<ref name="Scene"/> His voice has been compared to [[Willie Nelson]], [[Al Green]],<ref name="CMT"/> and [[Merle Haggard]].<ref name="CS"/> Dave Cobb, who produced ''Shine On Rainy Day'', described the album as "pure rural, country, soul-filled music."<ref name="Boot"/>

Lyrically, Cobb's songs often detail experiences of rural living in a conversational tone<ref name="Scene"/> and "the influence of his Southern raising is weaved through nearly every note and line."<ref name="WOC">{{cite news | last=Liebig| first=Lorie| title =Brent Cobb's 'Shine On Rainy Day' is the Best Debut Album We've Heard in a Long Time| work =Wide Open Country| date =October 6, 2016 | url =http://www.wideopencountry.com/brent-cobb-shine-on-rainy-day/| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref> Writing for ''Billboard'', Elias Leight noted that Cobb is "a laid back narrator, easygoing even when forlorn."<ref name="BB"/>
