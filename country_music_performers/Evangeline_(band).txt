==Biography==
Evangeline was a New Orleans–based band composed, at its most popular point, of singer Kathleen Steiffel, bass guitarist/washboardist Sharon Leger, keyboardist/accordionist Beth McKee, lead guitarist Rhonda Lohmeyer, fiddler/mandolinist Nancy Buchan, and drummer Dudley Fruge.<ref name="allmusic">{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p31340|pure_url=yes}}|title=Evangeline biography|accessdate=19 December 2008|last=McCall|first=Michael|work=Allmusic}}</ref><ref name="works">{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryworks.com/artist_full.asp?KEY=EVANGELINE |title=Evangeline biography |accessdate=19 December 2008 |work=Country Works |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320084552/http://www.countryworks.com/artist_full.asp?KEY=EVANGELINE |archivedate=March 20, 2005 }}</ref> The band entered a talent competition called Jazz Search in 1988, followed by the Marlboro Talent Roundup and the [[Colgate Country Showdown|True Value Country Music Showdown]].  They were eventually discovered by singer [[Jimmy Buffett]], who signed them to Margaritaville Records, his personal subsidiary of [[MCA Records]].<ref name="works"/>

Evangeline released its self-titled debut album in 1992, under the executive production of Buffett.<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r112746|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Evangeline'' review|accessdate=19 December 2008|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|work=Allmusic}}</ref> Although this album produced no chart singles in the US, "If I Had a Heart" peaked at No.&nbsp;81 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts in Canada. Fruge and Buchan left the group before the release of their second album, 1994's ''French Quarter Moon''. This album produced their first US chart single in "Let's Go Spend Your Money Honey", a No.&nbsp;70 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Also included on this album was the song "She's a Wild One", which later became a Number One hit in 1994 for [[Faith Hill]] under the title "[[Wild One (Faith Hill song)|Wild One]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r191509|pure_url=yes}}|title=''French Quarter Moon'' review|accessdate=19 December 2008|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|work=Allmusic}}</ref> A third album, ''Louisiana Aye Yi Yi'', recorded in 1990 when Evangeline was composed of Rhonda Lohmeyer, Sharon Leger and Leslie Doyle, was issued in 1996. That final recording featured more [[Zydeco]] and [[Cajun music|Cajun songs]] than their first two albums, including tunes written by [[Rockin' Sidney]] (Sidney Simien), [[D. L. Menard]], and several traditional Cajun songs.
