==Biography==
Martin was born in [[Logansport, Louisiana]]. As a teenager, he worked on an [[oil rig]] in addition to playing [[American football]] and [[bull riding]]. He broke his collar bone doing the latter, after which he developed an addiction to [[painkiller]]s. After this, he briefly enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and, after an attempted suicide, began recording music.<ref name="people">{{cite web | url=https://people.com/country/bryan-martin-wolves-cry-music-video-premiere/ | title=Bryan Martin on How Writing Music After Misfiring a Gun Saved His Life: 'I've Lived Through It' | publisher=People | date=January 27, 2023 | accessdate=April 15, 2024}}</ref>

Martin released the albums ''If It Was Easy'' in 2019 and ''Self Inflicted Scars'' two years later.
