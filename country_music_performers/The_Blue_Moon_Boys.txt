'''The Blue Moon Boys''' were an American [[rock and roll]] band that was formed by [[Elvis Presley]], lead [[guitar]]ist [[Scotty Moore]] and [[double bass]] player [[Bill Black]]. The group members were introduced by [[Sun Studio]] owner [[Sam Phillips]] in 1954, except for drummer [[D.J. Fontana]], who joined the group during a [[Louisiana Hayride]] tour in 1955. The Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2007. The band was named after [[Bill Monroe|Bill Monroe's]] song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".

== Background ==
On July 18, 1953, [[Elvis Presley]] recorded a single at  [[Sun Studio]] as a gift for his [[Gladys Presley|mother]]'s birthday, the [[Ink Spots]]' "My Happiness", with "That's When Your Heartaches Begin" on the flipside.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| title=Where did Elvis Presley start his career?| publisher=elvislovemetender.com| access-date=2010-10-04| archive-date=2011-07-10| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710184750/http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| url-status=dead}}</ref>
Studio owner [[Sam Phillips]] was not there, so Presley's recording was managed by his secretary, [[Marion Keisker]], who kept a demo copy of the recording.<ref>Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-33225-9}}. Retrieved 2010-09-27.</ref>

At Phillips' behest Keisker called Presley for an appointment at the studio almost a year later; he returned on June 26, 1954.<ref name=Historyofrock>{{cite web | url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/sam_phillips_sun_records_two.htm| title=Sam Phillips' Sun Records| publisher=history-of-rock.com|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref> Although most of the session was not recorded, Phillips was impressed by Presley and introduced him to the [[country music]] band [[Starlight Wranglers]]' guitarist [[Scotty Moore]], who later introduced Presley to double bass player [[Bill Black]].<ref name=Hillbilly>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| title=Elvis Aaron Presley 1953-1955: The Hillbilly Cat.| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au| access-date=2010-09-27| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921184326/http://elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| archive-date=2010-09-21}}</ref>

== Sun recordings ==
On July 5, 1954, the trio headed to the Sun Studios for a recording test together. They recorded the songs "Harbor Lights" and "[[I Love You Because]]", and during a break they performed an impromptu version of [[Arthur Crudup]]'s "[[That's All Right]]", which impressed Phillips, who asked for a refinement of the interpretation that later was recorded.<ref name=Historyofrock/> 
Phillips played the recording for [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]]'s [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Dewey Phillips]], who played the song on his regular show next night, on July 8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lyrics.elvispresley.com.au/lyrics/thats_all_right_mama.html| title=That's Alright| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref>
On July 9, the trio recorded what became the flipside to "That's All Right", an uptempo [[rockabilly]] version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/show_pic.php?key=3318&type=ls | title=Rockin' Country Style| publisher=rcs-discography.com|access-date = 2010-09-27}}</ref>  
The single was released on July 19, 1954,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elvicities.com/~elvis100/songsbluemoonof.htm | title=Blue Moon of Kentucky| publisher=elvicities.com|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref> and was a local hit in [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]] and [[New Orleans]].<ref name=Hillbilly/>

[[Scotty Moore]] became the manager of the band, and they toured several cities in the south, the three members still working at their regular employments when not touring.<ref name=LastTrain>Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-33225-9}}.</ref> Both Moore and Black focused more on the group after they let Presley perform at the regular Starlight Wranglers show on the Bon Air club, where the reception of the audience was unfavorable, and led to animosity between them and the other members of the group for having to leave the stage.<ref name=Hillbilly/>
The Blue Moon Boys appeared on a regular basis at Eagle's Nest club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elvisconcerts.com/liv1954.htm| title=1954. The First Concerts|publisher=elvisconcerts.com| access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref> Sam Phillips booked the band an appearance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], which was not well received.<ref name=LastTrain/>
After the failure, Phillips contacted Opry's main competition, the [[Louisiana Hayride]]. They made their first appearance on October 16, 1954.<ref name=Hillbilly/> Presley sang "That's All Right" followed by the flipside of the record, "Blue Moon of Kentucky". The performance was well received and they signed a one-year contract to be official members of the Hayride,<ref name=ElvisHayride>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/ElvisHayride1.html| title=Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel, Memphis| publisher=yahoo.com| access-date=2010-09-28| archive-date=2018-09-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927110604/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/ElvisHayride1.html| url-status=dead}}</ref> while Presley also signed a new management contract with [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]].<ref name=ElvisHayride/> 
On August 8, [[D.J. Fontana]] joined the band as the [[Drums|drummer]] on a regular basis after having played occasionally with them, the first time in [[Shreveport]] and subsequently on tour.<ref name=Hillbilly/>
After disputes with [[Hank Snow]]'s manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker|Tom Parker]], who booked most of Presley's appearances, Bob Neal turned over the contract to Colonel Parker who became officially Presley's manager on December 15, 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=colonel-tom-parker| title=Elvis On The Road: 1955-56| publisher=pophistorydig.com| access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref>
