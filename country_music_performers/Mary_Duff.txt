'''Mary Duff''' is an Irish [[Country music|country]], pop and folk singer. 

Duff’s rise to fame began in the 1990s when she was discovered by Irish singer [[Daniel O'Donnell]]. O'Donnell invited her to perform with him on his television show, and the rest, as they say, is history. Duff became a regular on the show and soon began touring with Daniel. She quickly gained a reputation as one of the most talented singers in Ireland, and her popularity began to grow beyond the country’s borders.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-07 |title=When was Irish singer Mary Duff born? - TravelAsker |url=https://travelasker.com/when-was-irish-singer-mary-duff-born/ |access-date=2024-04-06 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Duff and O'Donnell parted ways as duo in 2019. Duff is quoted saying on the topic, "I wanted to experiment more with songs and do a wider variety of songs, not necessarily ones that would have suited his audience."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Walsh |first=Kayla |date=2021-02-11 |title=Mary Duff says people have accused her of having an affair with Daniel O'Donnell |url=https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/country-singer-mary-duff-says-23486409 |access-date=2024-04-06 |website=RSVP Live |language=en}}</ref>
