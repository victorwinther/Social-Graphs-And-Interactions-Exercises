Hull's vocal debut album on [[Rounder Records]], released in May 2008, was co-produced by [[Alison Krauss]] and [[Ron Block]] which follows a self-released CD ''Angel Mountain'', in 2002. The production by Hull and Ron Block paid tribute and honored the tradition and style of bluegrass music. The album contained 3 original songs penned by Hull. She was just 15 when she recorded the album and 16 when it was released.

===''Daybreak''===
On her 2011 second release on Rounder Records, the 20-year-old has composed seven of the 12 songs and it was produced by [[Alison Krauss & Union Station]] bassist [[Barry Bales]]. The album features collaborations with Bryan Sutton on guitar and Randy Kohrs on dobro. Guest singers include [[Dan Tyminski]], Shawn Lane and Ronnie Bowman.

=== ''Features'' ===
Hull was a guest vocalist with lead singer James Adkins on the male-female duet "Love Song",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Big Virginia Sky releases debut, self-titled album!|url = http://www.bigvirginiasky.com/news/2015/10/3/big-virginia-sky-releases-debut-self-titled-album|website = Big Virginia Sky|access-date = January 12, 2016}}</ref> featured on the 2015 self-titled album from Americana group [[Big Virginia Sky]].

=== ''Weighted Mind'' ===
Released on January 29, 2016, ''[[Weighted Mind]]'', Hull's third LP, was produced by the highly regarded banjo player [[Béla Fleck]], who encouraged Hull to consider recording it solo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mandolincafe.com/forum/content.php?201-Sierra-Hull-The-Weighted-Mind-Interview|title=Mandolin Cafe – Sierra Hull – The Weighted Mind Interview|work=Mandolin Cafe Forum|access-date=April 10, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Hull, however, decided to enlist an accompanist, bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, who is featured on every track. The album also includes vocal contributions by [[Alison Krauss]], [[Abigail Washburn]], and [[Rhiannon Giddens]].

NPR reviewer Jewly Hight called ''Weighted Mind'' a "stunning coming-of-age album," adding that "Hull has joined the rarefied company of [[Nickel Creek]] expats [[Chris Thile]], [[Sara Watkins]] and [[Sean Watkins]], pedigreed virtuosos whose youthful, searching musical minds have taken them into postmodern singer-songwriter territory and beyond."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/20/463722383/first-listen-sierra-hull-weighted-mind|title=Review: Sierra Hull, 'Weighted Mind'|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref>

=== ''Treasure Of The Broken Land: The Songs Of Mark Heard'' ===
Hull contributed her cover of "Strong Hand of Love" in a [[Mark Heard]] tribute album entitled "Treasure Of The Broken Land: The Songs Of Mark Heard" (Storm Weathered Records) in 2017.

Liam Lewis opined, "25 Trips is an eclectic album, with a contemporary feel, showcasing Hull’s songwriting and exceptional vocals, crystal clear but with emotion and character, on 13 songs, self and co-written on the pleasures and travails of becoming the person and the musician she is today."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellesandgals.com/2020/03/12/review-sierra-hull-25-trips/|title=Review: Sierra Hull – 25 Trips|first=Liam|last=Lewis|date=March 12, 2020|accessdate=March 15, 2021}}</ref>
