'''Charles Arthur Feathers''' (June 12, 1932 – August 29, 1998)<ref name="AMG"/> was an American musician most associated with the [[rockabilly]] scene of the 1950s. Although not initially recognized for his contributions to rockabilly, over time his presence would become greatly elevated and he has been cited as an influence by a number of musicians.

==Biography==
Feathers was born in [[Holly Springs, Mississippi]], United States.<ref name= "Presley">{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Myrna |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-09-mn-21031-story.html |title=Charlie Feathers; Co-Wrote Pivotal Song for Presley |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 9, 1998 |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

He started out as a session musician at [[Sun Studios]], playing any side instrument he could in the hopes of someday making his own music there.<ref name= "Iobit">{{cite news |last=Leigh |first=Spencer |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-charlie-feathers-1196913.html |title=Obituary: Charlie Feathers |work=[[The Independent]] |date=September 9, 1998 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>  He eventually played on a small label started by [[Sam Phillips]] called Flip records which got him enough attention to record a couple of singles for [[Sun Records]] and [[Holiday Inn Records]]. By all accounts the singer was not held in much regard by Phillips, but Feathers often made the audacious claim that he had arranged "[[That's All Right]]" and "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" for [[Elvis Presley]]. He also claimed that his "We're Getting Closer (To Being Apart)" had been intended to be Elvis' sixth single for Sun. He did, however, get his name on one of Elvis' Sun records, "[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget (song)|I Forgot To Remember To Forget]]" when the writer Stan Kesler asked him to record a demo of the song.<ref name="AMG">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4241/biography|pure_url=yes}} Charlie Feathers biography] at [[AllMusic]]</ref><ref name=bc>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabilly.nl/artists/feathers.htm|title= Black Cat Rockabilly Biography of Charlie Feathers|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref>

He then moved on to [[Meteor Records]] and then [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] where he recorded his best-known work.  His 1950s singles included "Peepin' Eyes", "Defrost Your Heart", "Tongue-Tied Jill" and "Bottle to the Baby". When his King contract ran out he still continued to perform, although Feathers thought there was a conspiracy to keep his music from gaining the popularity it deserved.<ref name=bc/>

In the mid-1980s, he performed at times at new music nightclubs like the Antenna Club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], sharing the bill with [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] bands like [[Tav Falco's Panther Burns]], who, as devoted fans of Feathers, had introduced him to their label's president.<ref name= "Panther">{{cite news |last=Sprague |first=David |url= https://variety.com/2001/music/reviews/panther-burns-1200467792/ |title=Panther Burns |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 17, 2001 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

He released his ''New Jungle Fever'' album in 1987 and ''Honkey Tonk Man'' in 1988, featuring the lead guitar work of his son, Bubba Feathers. These later albums of original songs penned by Feathers were released on the [[France|French]] label New Rose Records, whose other 1980s releases included albums by [[Johnny Thunders]], [[Alex Chilton]], [[Roky Erickson]], [[The Cramps]], [[The Gun Club]], and others.

He died on August 29, 1998, of complications from a [[stroke]]-induced coma.<ref name= "Presley" /><ref name= "Iobit" /> He was buried at [[Forest Hill Cemetery South (Memphis, Tennessee)|Forest Hill Cemetery South]] in Memphis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Amos|first=Edward|year=2015|title=Gravesites of Southern Musicians|url={{Google books|bTOSCgAAQBAJ|page=59|plainurl=yes}}|page=59|access-date=2022-10-05}}</ref>

== Style and influences ==

Charlie Feathers studied and recorded several songs with [[Junior Kimbrough]], whom he called "the beginning and end of all music".<ref>Liner notes by Anthony DeCurtis in *You Better Run: The Essential Junior Kimbrough*, released by Fat Possum Records, 2002</ref> His childhood influences were reflected in his later music of the 1970s and 1980s, which had an easy-paced, sometimes sinister, [[country blues|country-blues]] tempo, as opposed to the frenetic fast-paced style favored by some of his rockabilly colleagues of the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Feathers was known for being a master of shifting emotional and sonic dynamics in his songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} His theatrical, hiccup-styled, energetic, rockabilly vocal style inspired a later generation of rock vocalists, including [[Lux Interior]] of [[The Cramps]].<ref name= "Lux">{{cite news |last=Whiteside |first=Jonny |url= https://www.laweekly.com/music/lux-interior-a-remembrance-from-jonny-whiteside-2404319 |title=Lux Interior: A Remembrance from Jonny Whiteside |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

Feathers' song, "That Certain Female" was featured on the soundtrack to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2003 film, ''[[Kill Bill:<!-- The official website shows a colon in the title.  See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --> Volume 1]]''. His "Can't Hardly Stand It" was featured on the follow-up ''[[Kill Bill:<!-- The official website shows a colon in the title.  See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-2/ --> Volume 2]]'' soundtrack, as well as the highly successful video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''. A brief bit of "Can't Hardly Stand It" was also featured in the 2013 film ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]''.
  
Charlie Feathers' pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. [[Bob Dylan]] has featured Charlie Feathers on the second season of his [[XM satellite radio]] show [[Theme Time Radio Hour]], playing Feathers' records "One Hand Loose" (on the "Countdown" show, Dec. 12, 2007) and "Defrost Your Heart" (on the "Cold" show, April 2, 2008). His song "Can't Hardly Stand It" is featured in the video game [[Grand Theft Auto V]] on the game's radio station, Rebel Radio. Feathers is an inductee in the [[Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msmusic.org/mississippi-country-musicians.html|title=Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame - Country|website=Msmusic.org|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}</ref>
