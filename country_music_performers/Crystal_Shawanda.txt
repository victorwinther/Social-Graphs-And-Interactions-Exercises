== Early life ==
Shawanda was born in [[Wiikwemkoong First Nation]], [[Manitoulin Island|Manitoulin Island, Ontario]].  Where she began performing at 6 years old, she began acting with Debajemujig Theatre when she was 9, and began getting paid when she was 10, and recorded her first album in Nashville,TN, with Canadian producer Gary Buck, when she was 13. She spent her first 3 years of high school in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], where she attended Korah C.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sootoday.com/local-entertainment/crystal-shawanda-finds-her-wings-604507|title=Crystal Shawanda finds her wings|work=SooToday.com|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en|archive-date=2018-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315004217/https://www.sootoday.com/local-entertainment/crystal-shawanda-finds-her-wings-604507|url-status=live}}</ref> Her surname translates to "Dawn of a New Day",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hearsomethingcountry.com/artists/shawanda.html|title=HearSomethingCountry.com|date=June 2, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602084339/http://hearsomethingcountry.com/artists/shawanda.html|archive-date=2008-06-02}}</ref> which was the inspiration of the title track of her debut album of the same name.

At 16 Crystal moved to Nashville,TN,where she busked on street corners, and sitting in at Songwriters rounds, she moved back home to Wiikwemkoong for a couple years, and then back to Nashville again, she went back and forth one more time before permanently making it her home, and has been a resident ever since. Upon returning the final time she played for tips at the world famous Tootsie's Orchid Lounge,down on Broadway. She signed a publishing deal with Island Bound Music in 2014,and then signed a production deal with Scott Hendricks in 2015, and signed with RCA records in 2016.

Many of Shawanda's songs have been inspired by her connections to Wiikwemkoong and part of her 2016 album was recorded at the Debajehmujig Creation Centre in [[Assiginack|Manitowaning, Manitoulin Island]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|title=Crystal Shawanda talks about her two new albums set to release this summer|last=Burridge|first=Robin|date=2016-04-27|work=Manitoulin Expositor|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070442/http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|archive-date=2018-03-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Music career==
Shawanda's first album, ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]'', was released in Canada on June 24, 2008, and in the United States on August 19. The album entered the Canadian Country Albums chart at number 2, and the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart at number 16. It became the highest charted album by a full-blooded Canadian First Nations country artist in the SoundScan era.<ref>[http://www.sonybmgnashville.com/pressreleases/details.cfm?artistid=1000010&pressid=1000520]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

Shawanda toured with various artists across Canada and the northern United States in 2008. In 2009, she toured Canada and the United States with [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Dierks Bentley]] as a special guest on the Paisley Party 2009 tour. Her first single, "You Can Let Go", peaked at number 21 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. In mid-2009, Shawanda left RCA Nashville and, through her own record label, New Sun Records, and a distribution deal with EMI released a Christmas album titled ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''.

In 2010, Shawanda released a single, "Beautiful Day", via her own label, New Sun Records. Shawanda also performed at the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in 2010, performing "Let's Come Together" and "This Is My Land".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |title=Crystal Shawanda to Perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade « Nashville.com |accessdate=2014-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222192231/http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref> She then released another single, "Love Enough", on August 15, 2011, in both Canada and the United States, and in promotion she went on to tour with Reba. Shawanda's second studio album, ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]'', was released by New Sun on April 24, 2012, and won a Juno award for Aboriginal Album of the year in 2013. She became the first full blood Indigenous woman as the CEO of a record label, to procure these milestones.

In 2014, Shawanda made a departure from country music and released a Blues album titled "The Whole World's got the Blues",she focused on rather than regurgitating someone else's blues, she told her story as an Indigenous woman in "Pray Sister Pray", which raised awareness of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous women issue, across Canada. She filmed a music video in her hometown with the help of her community, and the music video is now being used in schools across Canada, as a teaching tool of this rising issue. This album was nominated for "Aboriginal Album of the year", and Shawanda was invited to perform at the Juno Awards opening Gala.

In 2016, Shawanda released her 4th album "Fish out of water", feeling torn between her future and her past, the album had a mix of Blues and country music songs, which ended up having am Americana sound. Perhaps best said by DMME.net "She's a force of nature, Crystal Shawanda, the Canadian singer may reside in Nashville, but her casting as a country artist, whitewashed as the genre demands, is hopefully over".

In 2017, Shawanda released "Voo Doo Woman", consisting of 6 covers of blues standards, and 4 originals. Later that year Crystal signed a record deal with True North Records, who rereleased the album later that year, and they achieved moderate airplay at Blues Radio in America.

In 2020, Shawanda released "Church House Blues",which had extensive airplay at Blues Radio in America, and in Europe. She also went on to become the first Indigenous woman to win a Juno award for "Blues album of the year".

In 2022 Crystal released "Midnight Blues", which debuted at #8 on the American Billboard blues chart, and she became the first full blood Indigenous person to appear on this chart. She also received extensive airplay at Blues radio. This album was also nominated for "blues album of the year" at the Juno awards.
