'''Amie Noelle Comeaux''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|m|oʊ}}; December 4, 1976 – December 21, 1997) was an American [[country music]] singer who gained fame in her teens. Her debut album, ''Moving Out'', was released on [[Polydor Records]] in 1994, and it produced the single "Who's She to You", a No.&nbsp;64 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Two posthumous albums, ''A Very Special Angel'' and ''Memories Left Behind'', were issued in 1998 and 2007, respectively.

==Early life==
Comeaux first began singing at nursing homes and weddings as a child. When she was nine years old, she sang the [[Star-Spangled Banner]] at a [[New Orleans Saints]] game in the [[Louisiana Superdome]], and continued to do so throughout her teenage years. Comeaux was also chosen to play the lead role in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] Little Theater.

==Career==
Record producer [[Harold Shedd]] had been working with Comeaux since she was ten years old, helping her with her singing skills.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amie-comeaux-mn0000747865/discography |title=Amie Comeaux &#124; Album Discography |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1998-06-30 |accessdate=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref name="wire">{{cite web |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/01-12-98/nash_music-industry.html |title="Before Her Time": Country music loses Amie Comeaux |accessdate=2008-01-07 |last=Keel |first=Beverly |date= 1998-01-12 |work=Nashville Scene}}</ref>

In 1993, she was signed to [[Polydor Records]] label. A year later, her debut album ''Moving Out'' was released;<ref name="allmusic"/> however, Polydor closed its doors soon afterward, and Comeaux was left without a record deal. [[Toby Keith]], who was also on Polydor at the time, had offered to help with Comeaux's second album before the label's closure.<ref name="wire"/>

==Death==
On December 21, 1997, Comeaux was returning home with her grandmother and her godchild, Megan, from a [[Christmas]] family gathering in [[Alabama]]. As Comeaux passed a car, her own automobile [[hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaned]] due to heavy rain and struck a tree. She was killed instantly.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brusly singer dies in car wreck|date=December 22, 1997|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]}}</ref> Comeaux's grandmother and godchild were injured in the crash and were hospitalized for some time, but both survived. She was buried in Grace Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Plaquemine, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Briefs|date=December 23, 1997|work=The Advocate}}</ref>

Comeaux's posthumous album ''A Very Special Angel'' was released March 6, 1998, by Rival Records of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], but due to printing errors, the album had to be repackaged and was re-released 20 days later. Comeaux had co-written some of the songs on the album. A second posthumous album, ''Memories Left Behind'', was released in 2007. This album was dedicated to Comeaux's mother, who died in August 2006.
