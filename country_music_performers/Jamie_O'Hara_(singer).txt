'''James Paul O'Hara''' (August 8, 1950 – January 7, 2021) was an American [[country music]] artist. Between 1986 and 1990, he and [[Kieran Kane]] comprised [[The O'Kanes]], a duo that charted seven singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] charts, including the No. 1 single "[[Can't Stop My Heart from Loving You]]". After the O'Kanes disbanded in 1990, both O'Hara and Kane recorded solo albums of their own. In addition, O'Hara continued writing songs for other country music artists,<ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Jamie-OHara.html |title=Jamie O'Hara biography |access-date=December 19, 2007 |website=Oldies.com}}</ref> including [[The Judds]]' 1986 hit "[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days)]]" which earned him a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Grammy Award]].

==Biography==
O'Hara was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], where he attended [[Ottawa Hills High School (Ohio)]] and played Varsity Football. He had initially planned to pursue a career in [[American football]], but after a career-ending knee injury, O'Hara shifted his focus to singing and songwriting.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p110640|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jamie O'Hara Biography |access-date=December 19, 2007 |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> By 1975, he had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he was signed to a publishing contract. Among the songs that he composed throughout the 1980s were "[[Older Women]]" and "[[Wandering Eyes]]" a number one and number two single, both for [[Ronnie McDowell]].<ref name="oldies" />

===The O'Kanes===

[[Kieran Kane]], another songwriter who worked for the same publishing company, first collaborated with O'Hara on a song titled "Bluegrass Blues", eventually recorded by [[The Judds]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Afterwards, the two began writing more songs together; by 1986, they decided to form a duo known as [[The O'Kanes]]. The same year, O'Hara wrote "[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)]]", which was also recorded by The Judds; in addition to becoming a number one single on the country music charts, this song earned him a Grammy Award for Best Country Song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blprevgrammysong.htm |title=Grammys – Previous Winners – Best Country Song |access-date=December 19, 2007 |website=About.com |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208144810/http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blprevgrammysong.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p110640|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jamie O'Hara > Charts & Awards > Grammy Awards |access-date=December 19, 2007 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

Signed to [[Sony Music Nashville|Columbia Nashville]] in 1986, The O'Kanes recorded three studio albums for the label, in addition to charting seven singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles charts. Their third album failed to produce any singles and by 1990, the duo parted ways, with both members assuming solo careers.

===Return to solo career===
O'Hara recorded a solo album for [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] in 1994. His only album for the label, ''Rise Above It'', was issued that year, followed by a second album titled ''Beautiful Obsession'' seven years later. In addition, O'Hara continued to write songs for other artists, including cuts by [[Shelby Lynne]], [[Gary Allan]], and [[Trisha Yearwood]].<ref name="oldies"/>
