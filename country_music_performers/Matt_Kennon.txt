==Biography==
Matthew Carl Ferguson was born in [[Conyers, Georgia]].<ref name="rockdale"/> He was adopted at birth by two parents, who had previously lost three of their four biological children to a house fire. Kennon's birth mother, who already had another son, made a decision to have an abortion, but she arrived at her doctor's office two weeks too late and was told she had to carry the child to full term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboot.com/2010/01/25/matt-kennon-adoption/|title=Matt Kennon Discovers Shocking Details About His Adoption|last=Hughes|first=Donna|date=January 25, 2010|work=The Boot|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref>

He began playing the drums at age seven, and went on to play drums in high school [[jazz]] bands.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1579734/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Matt Kennon biography|last=Leggett|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref> Later on, he began performing at clubs in the [[Atlanta]], Georgia area, playing [[cover version]]s of country and [[southern rock]] songs.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In the late 2000s, Kennon self-released an album of his music, which he began selling at his concerts. He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he met [[Travis Tritt]]'s former manager Gary Falcon, who recommended him to [[Kyle Lehning]], a record producer known for his work with [[Randy Travis]].<ref name="allmusic"/> After Travis recorded Kennon's "Turn It Around" and released it as a single,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randytravis.com/blog/italianicon235/digging-bones-xclusive-interview-matt-kennon|title=Digging Up Bones Xclusive: Interview With Matt Kennon|work=Randy Travis.com|accessdate=October 19, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818003837/http://www.randytravis.com/blog/italianicon235/digging-bones-xclusive-interview-matt-kennon|archive-date=August 18, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kennon was signed to a publishing contract.
