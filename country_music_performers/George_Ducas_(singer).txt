'''George Ducas''' is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter, and musician, known for his blend of modern-day and roots  [[country music]]. He has released four studio albums: 1994's ''George Ducas'', 1997's ''Where I Stand'', 2013's ''4340'' <ref name="allmusic"/> and 2019's ''Yellow Rose Motel.'' His first two albums charted six consecutive singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart, the highest being his signature hit "[[Lipstick Promises]]" which reached No.&nbsp;9  and was also a No.&nbsp;1 [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] video. Ducas returned to the No.&nbsp;1 spot on CMT with his 2019 single "Eastwood."

==Early life==
George Ducas was born in [[Galveston, Texas]] and was raised in his early years by his father Steve (an [[Exxon]] chemical engineer) and his mother Irene (a teacher and a poet) in nearby Texas City, Texas.<ref name="MitchellChron">Mitchell, Rick.

==Career==
Ducas performed in Nashville area clubs by night and honed his songwriting skills by day. In 1994, songwriter [[Radney Foster]] took "[[Just Call Me Lonesome (Radney Foster song)|Just Call Me Lonesome]]", a song Ducas co-wrote, into the Top Ten on the country charts.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p141712/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=George Ducas biography |access-date=November 1, 2013 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> 

Ducas' debut single "Teardrops" became a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts.{{cn|date=July 2024}} "[[Lipstick Promises]]" followed in early 1995 reaching #9 leading the way to the release of his eponymous self-titled debut album. ''George Ducas'' also produced the No.&nbsp;52 "Hello Cruel World" and the No.&nbsp;72 "Kisses Don't Lie".

Due to a restructuring of Liberty Records, Ducas was transferred to [[Capitol Records]] Nashville. Initially Ducas' sophomore album ''Where I Stand'' was slated for release in 1996, however some record label shuffling pushed the release into the following year kicking off with the lead single "Every Time She Passes By” followed by “Long Trail Of Tears”. Ducas enlisted [[Vince Gill]] to feature his accompanying background vocals on the album.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

Ducas was a songwriter for artists [[Garth Brooks]], [[Sara Evans]], [[Eli Young Band]], [[Randy Rogers Band]], [[Gary Allan]], [[The Chicks]], and [[Trisha Yearwood]].{{cn|date=July 2024}} He co-wrote - "[[The Rock: Stone Cold Country 2001|Beer Run (B Double E Double Are You In?)]]", a duet for [[Garth Brooks]] and [[George Jones]] - which received a Grammy nomination in 2009 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].<ref name=Grammy2002>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/complete-list-of-grammy-nominees/|title=Complete List Of Grammy Nominees|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010122104/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/04/entertainment/main323197.shtml|archive-date=October 10, 2003|date=January 4, 2002|access-date=March 19, 2011|url-status=live|publisher=[[CBS]]}}</ref>

In 2005, Ducas and Radney Foster co-wrote the No. 1 hit "[[A Real Fine Place to Start]]" for [[Sara Evans]] which led to Ducas spending the latter half of 2007 opening shows for her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1572308/20071018/evans_sara.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029204206/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1572308/20071018/evans_sara.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 29, 2007|title=Sara Evans Announces Tour With Josh Turner|website=Cmt.com}}</ref> 

In October 2013, Ducas released ''4340'' through the newly created independent label Loud Ranch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/george-ducas-4340-album-review |title=Album review: George Ducas – 4340 Album |access-date=November 1, 2013 |work=No Depression}}</ref> In 2016, Ducas released the single "Party with Your Boots On" which was licensed to the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] as their first official artist theme song on a limited term usage agreement.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

Ducas’ fourth studio album ''Yellow Rose Motel'' was released in January 2020. In addition to writing and recording the album in several Nashville recording sessions throughout 2017 and 2018, Ducas also co-produced the album. The song “Eastwood”, the first of three music videos from the album, became Ducas’ second #1 CMT video and remained in the top spot for three weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1804630/george-ducas-makes-our-day-with-eastwood/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403173428/http://www.cmt.com/news/1804630/george-ducas-makes-our-day-with-eastwood/|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 3, 2019|title=George Ducas Makes Our Day With Eastwood|website=Cmt.com}}</ref> 

In 2020, as a celebration of the 25th anniversary of his biggest hit, Ducas recorded a new version of "Lipstick Promises." American Songwriter Magazine called the new version 'a fun re-work' as "...the new version now features a little more energy as George kicked the tempo up a couple of notches. It hasn’t changed per se, it just sounds a little more like he plays it when he’s live onstage."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://americansongwriter.com/lipstick-promises-george-ducas-song-interview/|title=George Ducas Polishes Off A Commemorative Edition of Lipstick Promises|website=americansongwriter.com|date=November 5, 2020 }}</ref>

In 2020, Ducas began the process of recording his new album ''Long Way From Home'', which was produced by [[Pete Anderson]] ([[Dwight Yoakam]]) and released in June of 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |title= 'Long Way from Home' - George Ducas - New Album Review|date=June 20, 2024 |url=https://rootsnrevelry.com/long-way-from-home-george-ducas/}}</ref>
