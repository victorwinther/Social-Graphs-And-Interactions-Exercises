'''Rattlesnake Annie'''  (born '''Rosan Gallimore''', December 26, 1941)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=2045}}</ref> is an American [[country music|country singer]] and songwriter. She earned her nickname as a child from her respect of snakes. Rattlesnake began recording music in 1959 and achieved success in Europe. She became the first female country blues musician to tour the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries in Europe and released an album with a country singer [[Michal Tučný]] from [[Czechoslovakia]]. In 1989, she became the first American country performer to sign a recording contract with [[Sony Music Japan]].

==Early years==
She was born and raised near [[Puryear, Tennessee]], United States, on a [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]] farm.<ref name=brennan>{{citation|last=Brennan|first=Sandra|title=Rattlesnake Annie|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p23214/biography|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}</ref>

Rattlesnake's father had been a country and blues musician, singer, guitar and fiddle and she learned to play guitar at an early age.<ref name=brennan/> She earned her first paycheck from singing at age eight, and from then on her goal in life was to earn a living while making music.<ref name=ram/> When she was 12, Rattlesnake and two of her cousins formed a band called the Gallimore Sisters.  They performed locally and won a statewide talent contest in 1954, landing them an appearance in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on the ''Junior Grand Ole Opry'' and a live television performance.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

At age 16, Rattlesnake moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and then on to [[Huntsville, Alabama]].

==Recording career==
Rattlesnake continued to pursue a music career, and in 1974 her first single, "Texas Lullabye", was released.<ref name=brennan/> She recorded her debut album, ''Rattlesnakes and Rusty Water'', on her own label, Rattlesnake Records.<ref name=edwards>{{citation|last=Edwards|first=Joe|title=Snakes, Willie tops her charts|date=October 28, 1983|newspaper=The Courier|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k6AKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vEwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4727,5704551&dq=rattlesnake-annie|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}</ref> At the time, it was also rare for a woman to produce her own songs. Rattlesnake reminisced of those early days: "I was breaking down barriers. If I could work like a man in the fields, why couldn't I play a guitar and produce my own records?"<ref name=ram/>

Because of promotion and her focus for International music, her first album became popular in Europe. In the mid-1970s, she became the first female country blues singer/guitarist songwriter to play in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries of Europe. She appeared on television in [[East Germany]], and the [[West Germany|West German]] branch of [[Greenpeace]] adopted one of her songs, "Goodbye to a River", as their anthem. In [[Czechoslovakia]] she recorded an album, ''Rattlesnake Annie and the Last Cowboy'', with Czech country singer [[Michal Tučný]].<ref name=brennan/>

In 1991, Rattlesnake became the first American country performer to sign a recording contract with [[Sony Music Japan]].<ref name=brennan/> She expressed relief at the agreement, mentioning that "it's always been a hassle because they can never put me in a slot. What bin does the record store use for my records? ... When I signed with Sony Japan and they put me in their world music department, for the first time I felt free and understood."<ref name=hudson221>Hudson (2007), p. 221.</ref>

== Personal life ==
In the early 1960s she moved to [[Texas]], where she met and married Max McGowan.<ref name="brennan" /> The couple purchased 200 acres of land along the [[Brazos River]].  The land had never been cleared or lived on. She and her husband moved to Southern Spain in the 1990s, where they remained for 30 years. In [[Andalusia]] she immersed herself in the lives and music of the [[Romani people|Romani]] people and [[Flamenco]].<ref name="hudson223">Hudson (2007), p. 223.</ref><ref name="hudson219">Hudson (2007), p. 219.</ref>

==Music==
Rattlesnake has recorded music and performed live on every continent except [[Oceania]]<ref name=ram>{{citation|last=Ramakrishnan|first=Deepa H.|title=Blues singer reaches out to Indian women|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/10/stories/2006031004350200.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925003751/http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/10/stories/2006031004350200.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 25, 2006|accessdate=November 12, 2008|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=March 10, 2006}}</ref> In her career, she has recorded in over ten languages, including Czech, Russian, Spanish, Japanese, Maya, German, Chinese, Arabic and English.<ref name=hudson223/> Many of her songs contain a political message.  She says that "Songs are so important to make a statement on issues, and that's how I have used my music. Life is just full of objections, especially when you are a woman."<ref name=ram/> In this vein, she has recorded songs for the [[Civil Rights Movement]], for women's rights, and against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=ram/>
