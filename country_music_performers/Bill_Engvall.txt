Engvall spent most of his childhood living first in Galveston, then in [[Winslow, Arizona]], then moving back to near [[Dallas]], Texas during middle school.

==Career==
In 1990, Bill Engvall moved to Southern California to dedicate full-time to comedy. Early notoriety came from hosting the cable show ''A Pair of Jokers'' with [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and an appearance on ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' where he played Blanche's son Matthew, a stockbroker turned aspiring comic. Other early appearances included hosting [[A&E Network]]s ''[[The Improv|An Evening at The Improv]]'' as well as stand-up routines on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Engvall Makes His First Appearance on Network Television {{!}} Carson Tonight Show | website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzfDimg14Vo |access-date=19 October 2022 |language=en |date=1989-07-13}}</ref> and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]].<ref name="auto1"/>

A career breakthrough happened in 1992 when Engvall was named Best Male Standup at the [[American Comedy Awards]]. His first role as a series regular came soon after when he was cast in the ABC series ''[[Delta (American TV series)|Delta]]'', starring [[Delta Burke]]. However, the show only lasted one season and Engvall returned to making the rounds of comedy clubs and the occasional television appearance until 1996 when he was cast with fellow comic and best friend [[Jeff Foxworthy]] in the [[NBC]] version of ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]''. Signed by [[Warner Records]] in 1996, Engvall released the first of a series of successful comedy albums, ''[[Here's Your Sign]]'', based on his signature joke. The album was [[Music recording sales certification|certified Platinum]] and peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Country album chart. Excerpts from this album were remixed into a musical track titled "Here's Your Sign (Get the Picture)", featuring a chorus sung by country music artist [[Travis Tritt]].<ref name="auto"/> "Here's Your Sign (Get the Picture)" charted at number 29 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and number 43 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1997.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=120|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref> Engvall released two more albums by the end of the 1990s: ''[[Dorkfish]]'' in 1998 and ''[[Here's Your Christmas Album]]'' in 1999. The latter featured narrations by Engvall, as well as songs he co-wrote sung by session musicians.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-engvall-mn0000775644/biography | title=Bill Engvall biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=July 11, 2022}}</ref> One of these original compositions, "Here's Your Sign Christmas", also made the country charts in both 1998 and 1999.<ref name="whitburn"/>

In 2000, Engvall exited Warner Records for [[BNA Records]], citing managerial changes at Warner. His only BNA album, ''[[Now That's Awesome]]'', came out that same year.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Stark|first=Phyllis|date=August 12, 2000|title=Comedian Bill Engvall switches to BNA and delivers an 'awesome' 4th album|magazine=Billboard|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA31}}</ref> Like most of the albums before it, this included two tracks that interpolated stand-up lines from the album with a musical track. The title track featured guest vocals from [[T. Graham Brown]], [[Tracy Byrd]], and [[Neal McCoy]], while "Shoulda Shut Up" featured [[Julie Reeves]].<ref name="whitburn"/>

Engvall moved back to Warner for all subsequent albums. ''Cheap Drunk: An Autobiography'' in 2002, ''Here's Your Sign Reloaded'' in 2003, ''15° Off Cool'' in 2007, and ''Aged and Confused'' in 2009.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 2021, Engvall announced his intention to retire from stand-up comedy after his "Here's Your Sign, It's Finally Time" farewell tour.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/bill-engvall-retired-comedy-standup-heres-your-sign-1235039053/|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=August 11, 2021|accessdate=January 10, 2023|title=Bill Engvall to Retire From Stand-Up, Announces Farewell Comedy Tour|magazine=Variety}}</ref> He posted a video on YouTube confirming his retirement on December 30, 2022.

===Blue Collar Comedy Tour===
{{main|Blue Collar Comedy Tour}}
In 2000, [[Jeff Foxworthy]] and Engvall launched the first of six [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/movies|title=Movie Reviews|date=April 28, 2020|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The tours also featured [[Ron White]] and [[Larry the Cable Guy]] and were largely responsible for their breakout success. Each of the six years of the tour was very successful and spawned three films, a satellite radio show, and a television series titled ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' on [[The WB Television Network|The WB Network]].

===The Bill Engvall Show===
{{main|The Bill Engvall Show}}
In 2007, Engvall starred in his own sitcom where he played himself as a family counselor. The show lasted three seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926732/|title=The Bill Engvall Show (TV Series)|website=imdb.com}}</ref>

===Game show host===
On June 6, 2011, Engvall took over as host of ''[[Lingo (U.S. game show)|Lingo]]'' on [[Game Show Network]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gameshows.about.com/b/2011/01/13/gsn-bringing-lingo-back-with-new-host.htm |title=GSN Bringing Lingo Back with New Host |access-date=January 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210221705/http://gameshows.about.com/b/2011/01/13/gsn-bringing-lingo-back-with-new-host.htm |archive-date=February 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to an interview in ''American Profile'' magazine, Engvall said that he jumped at the chance to host the show, citing the fun that his friend Foxworthy had hosting ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' Engvall had been a fan of ''Lingo'' when it aired a few years previously before ending in 2007, admitting that his wife always beat him to the answers. When asked if there were any plans to have buddies Foxworthy or Larry the Cable Guy appear on ''Lingo'', he replied, "You never know! I would love to have them on the show because it would be a blast. I would really dig that."<ref>''American Profile'' newsmagazine. Article title: "Q&A with Bill Engvall". June 5, 2011</ref>

===''Dancing with the Stars''===
In 2013, Engvall was announced as a contestant on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 17)|17th season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' paired with professional dancer [[Emma Slater]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dancing-with-the-stars-leah-remini-valerie-harper-snooki-among-new-cast/|title="Dancing with the Stars": Leah Remini, Valerie Harper, Snooki among new cast|website=Cbsnews.com|date=September 4, 2013 }}</ref> In the first week, he danced the Foxtrot and received a score of 18. The second week was Latin week and he saw some higher scores from the judges receiving a 21 for his Jive. And the third week of competition, Bill saw his highest score of 24 with a Paso Doble to the Lone Ranger theme song. Throughout the rest of the show, the judges usually placed Engvall and Slater at the bottom of the leaderboard, but an enormous fan base kept them in the competition, resulting in higher-scoring contestants, e.g. [[Christina Milian]], [[Snooki]], [[Brant Daugherty]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], and [[Leah Remini]] being voted out instead.

On November 18, Engvall and Slater made it to the finals, along with [[Amber Riley]], [[Jack Osbourne]] and [[Corbin Bleu]]. The two finished in fourth place.

==Comedic style==
Engvall's most well-known routine is "here's your sign". In this routine, he offers "signs" to people whom he considers lacking in intellect. These jokes typically take the form of another person asking Engvall a "stupid question", to which Engvall typically responds with a sarcastic response before telling the person "here's your sign".<ref name="blue">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/243672967/ | title=Blue collar blues | work=Argus Leader | date=January 11, 2007 | accessdate=July 11, 2022 | pages=15D}}</ref> Other jokes in Engvall's routine include anecdotes about his life as a father and husband, typically in the form of [[self-deprecation]].<ref name="blue"/>

==Personal life==
Bill and Gail Engvall (born August 5, 1960) have been married since December 18, 1982. They have a daughter named Emily (born June 9, 1986), a 2008 graduate from the [[University of Puget Sound]] who is married to Will Holden, as well as a son, Travis (born June 25, 1991), a 2015 graduate from [[Northern Arizona University]]; both of whom are often mentioned during his routines.
