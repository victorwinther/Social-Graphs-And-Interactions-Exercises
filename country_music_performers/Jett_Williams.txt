In 1985, the Alabama State Court ruled she was the daughter of Hank Williams.

==Sole rights==
In January 2006, the [[Tennessee Court of Appeals]] upheld a lower court ruling stating Hank Williams' heirs — son Randall Hank Williams (Hank Williams Jr.) and daughter Jett Williams, Hank Jr.'s half-sister — have the sole rights to sell his old recordings made for a [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] radio station in the early 1950s. The court rejected claims made by [[PolyGram|Polygram Records]] and Legacy Entertainment in releasing recordings Williams made for the ''Mother's Best Flour Show'', a program that originally aired on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]]. The recordings, which Legacy Entertainment acquired in 1997, include live versions of Williams' hits and covers of other songs. Polygram contended Williams' contract with [[MGM Records]], which Universal Music Nashville now owns since 1998, gave them rights to release the radio recordings. In October 2008, a selection of the "Mother's Best" recordings was released by [[Time-Life]] as ''Hank Williams: The Unreleased Recordings''.

Jett Williams released a number of albums featuring her own songs, and toured with a version of the [[Drifting Cowboys]] to sing her father's songs.<ref>{{cite news
