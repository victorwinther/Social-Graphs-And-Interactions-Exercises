== Early life and education ==
{{BLP unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}
McCue grew up in [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]], an area southwest of Sydney and graduated from [[St Patrick's College, Campbelltown|Saint Patrick's college]] and the [[University of Technology, Sydney]] with a degree in Film Production and Film Studies. In 1988, McCue moved to [[Melbourne]] and took guitar lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]].

== Music career ==
McCue is a singer, songwriter, guitarist, multi-Instrumentalist, music-recording producer, engineer, and video director.

=== Early bands ===
McCue's first band was based in Sydney and was called ''Vertigo'' after the Alfred Hitchcock film.

In 1988 in Melbourne, answering an ad in the local press, she joined all-female rock band [[Girl Monstar]] as lead guitarist (1988–1993). The band had two Number One hits on the Australian Independent Charts and eventually received an [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] nomination for best independent act.

Following her stint with Girl Monstar, she played acoustically around Melbourne, later performing in [[Vietnam]] for a year before returning to Melbourne to record her [[Laughing EP]] (1996). She then joined Australian female trio [[Eden A.K.A.]], who signed to [[Columbia Records]] in the USA. Eden A.K.A. released the album ''Eden'' in 1998,<ref>{{cite web| publisher=[[Discogs]]| title=Eden A.K.A.| url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2407618-Eden-AKA |accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> and performed in Canada and the USA at the [[Lilith Fair]] in 1998 and 1999.

=== Solo and band-leader success ===

After signing with L.A. based manager, [[Mike Gormley]], McCue's first solo album, ''Amazing Ordinary Things'', was released in 1999 in Canada and Japan, and she toured with a number of well-known musicians, including a US tour with [[Lucinda Williams]], who would often introduce McCue as "my new favorite artist... and an amazing guitarist". Williams later included McCue on her Starbucks' 'Artist's Choice' compilation alongside [[Paul Westerberg]], John Coltrane, Ryan Adams, Patti Griffin and [[Leonard Cohen]].

McCue's success on the Lucinda Williams tour prompted the release of a live album, ''[[Live: Ballad of an Outlaw Woman]]'', recorded at [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco, California]], and her first Messenger Records release, ''Roll''.

''Roll'' also received numerous critical accolades, with ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' stating that the Australian performer had more "all-American authenticity than a dozen [[Martina McBride]]s" and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' drawing comparisons to Lucinda Williams and Canadian alt-country singer [[Kathleen Edwards]].  [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] from the [[BBC]] went as far as to call it his album of the year, and she toured internationally to promote the album. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

McCue released her album ''Koala Motel'' on Messenger Records in 2006. She completed an international tour to promote the album. She relocated from Los Angeles to Nashville. In August 2007, McCue was invited by [[Deborah Conway]] to take part in the Broad Festival project, which toured major Australian cities including performing at the [[Sydney Opera House]].<ref name="Elliott">{{Cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/ladys-night-at-the-beckoning-microphone/2008/08/18/1218911561072.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | title = Lady's Night at the Beckoning Microphone | last = Elliott | first = Tim | newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald | publisher = Fairfax Media | date = 19 August 2008 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2017}} With McCue and Conway were [[Sally Seltmann]], [[Jade Macrae]] and Abbe May – they performed their own and each other's songs.<ref name="Broad2007">{{Cite web | url = http://www.broadfestival.com/broad_2007.html | title = Broad 2007 | publisher = Broad Festival | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725075426/http://www.broadfestival.com/broad_2007.html | archive-date = 25 July 2011 | url-status = usurped }}</ref>

Her song "Stupid" (from ''Roll'') is included in the Time Life Collection, "4 Decades of Folk Rock." She was voted Folk Artist of 2008 by the Roots Music Association.

In 2013 McCue released her version of Bruce Springsteen's 'Born to Run' and began recording her new album ''Blue Sky Thinkin''.<ref name= "Blue Sky Thinkin">{{Cite web | url = http://www.guitargirlmag.com/interviews/interview-with-anne-mccue-an-aussie-at-home-in-east-nashville | title = At Home in East Nashville | date = April 2014 | publisher = Guitar Girl Magazine | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}</ref>

In February 2015, McCue released Blue Sky Thinkin' a collection or original songs reminiscent of swing era jazz. The album is a return to her early days in music. In an interview, she noted, "In my earlier existence as a young guitar player in Melbourne, I wanted to be a  jazz guitar player. I was studying jazz guitar. I was making my living playing jazz music, more like singing and playing guitar. ...  So for me [Blue Sky Thinkin'] was more like going back to that. ... I love the guitar tone of that era. I love the sound of the recordings. To me it’s very warm sounding.  I don’t think it’s ever sounded better than that. So I was trying to get those sounds. I’ve listened to Charlie Christian a lot. And also to Django [Reinhardt ]. It was just natural. I didn’t force it. I didn’t tell myself I’m going to make a Charlie Christian type song or do a Django song. I just wanted to do it. I’ve played that stuff a lot and I wanted to write songs in that style."<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode235 Americana Music Show #235], published on March 3, 2015.</ref>

===Assisting other musicians===
McCue produced and recorded two albums for other artists in 2009 – Tracey Bunn's "By The Wayside" and Denise DeSimone's "Pray Peace".  She also directed the videos for Amelia White's "Even Angels" and Tracey Bunn's "Shut Up And Let Me Breathe".  She produced albums released in 2018, for Ellen Starski (''The Days When Peonies Prayed For The Ants'') and [[Scott Miller (country musician)|Scott Miller]] (''Ladies Auxiliary'').

McCue played guitar on [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s 2017 release ''[[Robyn Hitchcock (2017 album)|Robyn Hitchcock]]''.
