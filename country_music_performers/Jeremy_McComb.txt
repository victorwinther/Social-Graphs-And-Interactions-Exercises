==Biography==
Jeremy McComb was born in Idaho.<ref name="gacbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26057_5836935,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123154742/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26057_5836935,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 23, 2013 |title=Artists A to Z: Jeremy McComb biography |accessdate=November 4, 2008 |work=[[Great American Country]] }}</ref> His father, Bob, was a local musician who played six nights a week and regularly brought him to venues where he performed. McComb made his singing debut at age eight, when his father invited him to join him onstage to sing [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]". Later on, McComb found work as a music director and disc jockey at the radio station [[KFOO-FM|KIXZ-FM]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].  He then befriended comedian [[Larry the Cable Guy]] while working at the station, and was hired as the comedian's tour manager in 2004 at age 23.<ref name="gac">{{cite web|url=http://www.gac.tv/gac/nw_cma_close_up/article/0,3034,GAC_26068_5938466_,00.html |title=New Artist Spotlight – Jeremy McComb |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |last=Doerschuk |first=Bob |work=[[Great American Country]] }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.angrycountry.com/article.php?story=20080205173036177 |title=Jeremy McComb – ''My Side of Town'' |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |date=February 5, 2008 |work=Angry Country |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143804/http://magazine.angrycountry.com/article.php?story=20080205173036177 |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

McComb began working on his music while serving as Larry's manager. While with the comedian, he was introduced to J.P. Williams, the CEO of Parallel Entertainment.<ref name="gacbio"/> He was then sent to a studio in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], where he began recording his debut album. Initially, it was to have been released on a division of [[Warner Bros. Records]], but legal difficulties forced Williams to release it on his own label instead.<ref name="dish"/> Entitled ''My Side of Town'', it was released on Parallel/New Revolution in June 2008, and was produced by Paul Riddle of the [[Marshall Tucker Band]].<ref name="gac"/> The first single from the album, "[[Wagon Wheel (song)|Wagon Wheel]]," was originally recorded by [[Bob Dylan]] and later by the [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] and [[Darius Rucker]]. Following it was "This Town Needs a Bar," which was written by [[Liz Rose]] and [[Jimmy Yeary]], and was originally featured in the soundtrack to the film ''[[Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector]]''.<ref name="dish">{{cite web |url=http://dishmag.com/issue79/music-film/7634/jeremy-mccomb-s-side-of-town/ |title=Jeremy McComb's side of town |accessdate=November 4, 2008 |last=Hollabuagh |first=Laurie |work=Dish Magazine}}</ref> The first two singles both failed to chart, although the third single, "Cold", debuted at number 58 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts in November 2008 and peaked at number 43.

''[[Country Weekly]]'' magazine gave ''My Side of Town'' three-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it "one of the year's most encouraging [albums]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countryweekly.com/jeremy_mccomb/reviews/526 |title=Jeremy McComb – ''My Side of Town'' |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |last=Chris |first=Neal |date=June 3, 2008|work=Country Weekly}}</ref> "Cold" received a favorable review from the country music review site Roughstock, whose critic Matt Bjorke called it "a ballad which details the difficulties that people sometimes have in getting over a relationship…McComb sings about feeling numb, or 'Cold' about the way that the relationship ended."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/jeremy-mccomb-cold-(single) |title=Jeremy McComb – "Cold" |accessdate=November 4, 2008 |last=Bjorke |first=Matt |work=Roughstock |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120091922/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/jeremy-mccomb-cold-%28single%29 |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}</ref>

Following his major label debut McComb independently released an EP titled "Leap and the Net will Appear". Which included the song "Easy as breathing" co-written with [[Kevin Kadish]] ([[Meghan Trainor]] / [[Jason Mraz]] producer & collaborator) The song while never worked as a single picked up AirPlay across the country.
