'''Jon Christopher Davis''' (born June 27, 1968) is an American [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[record producer]] whose musical style encompasses [[Rock music|rock]], [[soul]] and [[country]]. His songs have been covered by [[Dolly Parton]], [[Hal Ketchum]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]] of [[the Eagles]], [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Sherrie Austin]], [[Tammy Cochran]] and various [[Independent artist|indie artists]]. His music has been featured on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[FOX]], [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] and in [[USA Today]], ''[[Billboard]]'', ''[[Texas Highways]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]''. His discography includes work with [[Vince Gill]], [[Radney Foster]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Lukather]] ([[Toto (band)|Toto]]), [[Stan Lynch]] ([[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]), [[Dann Huff]] ([[Carrie Underwood]], [[Keith Urban]]) and [[David Z (producer)|David Z]] ([[Prince]], [[Jonny Lang]]).

==Early career==
Davis began his career in 1990 by playing the [[Dallas]] bar scene. In 1996, he was encouraged to move to [[Nashville]] by Grammy Award-winner, [[Rodney Crowell]]. In 1998, Davis signed with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] where he wrote songs for major-label artists. The following year, he signed an artist development deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. After six months, the label considered the recordings to be too left of center and eventually shelved the project. Those self-produced recordings caught the ear of hit producer, Dann Huff, who later signed Davis to his new subsidiary label under [[Sony Records]].

==2002–2007==
In 2002, Davis signed with [[MCA Records]] where fellow Texas singer-songwriter, [[Radney Foster]], came on board as producer. Davis also signed a new publishing deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] Publishing. When MCA decided to not release the record, Davis returned to his Texas roots and signed with the indie label, [[Palo Duro Records]]. After his debut album received a national release in 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' called his song, The Bottom Line, "One of the most intriguing tracks from the present, past and near future." The album also caught the attention of renowned music critic, [[Robert K. Oermann]] – "I’m a huge fan of this man’s album. Its second single sizzles with zesty rhythm, yelping vocals, sidewinder guitar and a ridiculously catchy melody. The major-label 'stars' on [[Music Row]] have nothing on this guy."

==2008–2013==
In 2008, Davis released the patriotic single, The Boy I Left Behind, with fellow Texas singer-songwriter, [[Deryl Dodd]]. It became the official theme song for The American Fallen Soldiers Project.

In 2009, Davis was the Texas statewide voice for [[Energy Future Holdings|TXU]] Energy. That same year, he released "Demos From the Vault (1999–2009)." The double album features guest appearances by [[Vince Gill]], Radney Foster, [[Jon Randall]], [[Steve Lukather]] (Toto) and Stan Lynch (The Heartbreakers).

In 2010, Davis was awarded Song of the Year by the [[American Cancer Society]].

In 2012, Davis was a featured artist on Troubadour TX, a national TV show following the careers of Texas singer-songwriters.

In 2013, LSA Burger Co. (named after his top 40 dance hall track, Lone Star Attitude) opened in Denton, TX. A second location is in The Colony, TX.
There are also two airport stores named after Lone Star Attitude located at [[DFW International Airport]].

==2014–present==
In 2014, Davis released the album, "Last Night's Dinner Party." 

In 2016, Davis collaborated with CMA Song of the Year nominee, [[Max T. Barnes]], on several singles and produced eight music videos.

In 2018, Davis released the album, "New Wind Blowing." 

In 2020, Davis released the EP, "The Ride." 

Davis is currently working on a new band project with Stan Lynch (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Don Henley) called The Speaker Wars.
