==Biography==
He was born in [[Springhill, Louisiana|Springhill]], [[Louisiana]], United States,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> to R. C. Stampley, Jr. (1920&ndash;2000) and Mary E. Stampley (1924&ndash;2004).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Stampley,_Joe/index.html |title=Joe Stampley Pictures, Biography, Discography |access-date=January 30, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105022831/http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Stampley,_Joe/index.html |archive-date=January 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Stampley befriended [[Merle Kilgore]] when he was aged 15 and they started writing songs together.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Kilgore arranged for Stampley to record two sides with [[Imperial Records]], and the resulting single, "Glenda" (1959),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/x5617|title=Joe Stampley - We're Through|access-date=August 10, 2021|website=45cat.com}}</ref> sold well locally but not elsewhere.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1961, [[Chess Records]] released another single by Stampley, "Teenage Picnic",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/joe-stampley|title=Joe Stampley Discography - USA |website=45cat.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref> but it also flopped.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

In the 1960s, Stampley was the main singer for the rock group, [[The Uniques (Louisiana band)|The Uniques]]<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> (not to be confused with the Jamaican and [[doo-wop]] groups with the same name). The Uniques were based out of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], about 55 miles southwest of Springhill, and began performing in [[Arkansas]], Louisiana, and [[Texas]]. In 1965, The Uniques recorded "Not Too Long Ago" (another Kilgore/Stampley composition),<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> the first national hit for Paula Records. One year later, they followed with "[[All These Things (Joe Stampley song)|All These Things]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The Uniques released four original albums, and one [[greatest hits]] [[compilation album|compilation]] between 1965 and their 1970 breakup. Most of their material was rooted in [[rhythm and blues]], rock, [[popular music|pop]], and [[swamp pop]] genres.

In 1971, Stampley signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Dot]] and recorded seven country albums that produced such hits as "[[Soul Song]]"; "Too Far Gone"; "If You Touch Me, You've Got To Love Me"; "I'm Still Loving You"; and a remake of "All These Things" as a [[Country-western two-step|two-step]] which reached No. 1 on the country [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

In 1975, he moved to [[Epic Records]], where he released thirteen albums. These albums included such hits as: "[[Roll On Big Mama]]," "Red Wine and Blue Memories," "If You've Got Ten Minutes (Let's Fall in Love)," "Do You Ever Fool Around," and "I'm Gonna Love You Back To Lovin' Me Again."<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Stampley has over 60 charted records. Joel Whitburn ranked Stampley 52nd among all country artists from 1944&ndash;1993 for charted singles. In 1976, Stampley had eight [[single (music)|singles]] on the Billboard country chart and was Billboard's singles-artist of the year.

In 2000, Stampley founded Critter Records. The first act signed to the label was [[Billy Hoffman (singer)|Billy Hoffman]].<ref>{{cite news|title=COUNTRY BEAT: Billy Ray Cyrus, Kathy Mattea, Robbie Fulks ...|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1224076/country-beat-billy-ray-cyrus-kathy-mattea.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427013435/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1224076/country-beat-billy-ray-cyrus-kathy-mattea.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 27, 2014|access-date=May 16, 2012|newspaper=[[MTV]]|date=October 27, 2000}}</ref>

Stampley occasionally performs in his native Springhill.

===Collaboration with Moe Bandy===
During the height of his success, Stampley began teaming with [[Moe Bandy]] on a string of duets.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Unlike the honky-tonk standards that both artists were known for, most of the "Moe and Joe" collaborations were [[tongue in cheek]] [[novelty songs|novelty]] and [[satire|satirical]] songs.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Their first charting hit together, "[[Just Good Ol' Boys]]", became a No. 1 hit in September 1979 and was their most successful single.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Other hits were "Holding the Bag", "[[Hey Joe (Carl Smith song)|Hey Moe, Hey Joe]]" (a cover of a single originally recorded by [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]], with modified title and lyrics), and "Where's the Dress".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The latter was a satire on [[Boy George]], and had an opening guitar riff similar to [[Culture Club]]'s No. 1 pop hit "[[Karma Chameleon]]", which got the duo into copyright problems.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

"Where's The Dress" won the American Video Association's award for Video of the Year in 1984.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moebandy.com/awardsandsongs.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105015054/http://www.moebandy.com/awardsandsongs.html |archive-date=November 5, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bandy and Stampley were recognized as the [[Country Music Association]]'s (CMA) 1980 Vocal Duo of the Year (as "Moe and Joe"), and won the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Vocal Duo award for two consecutive years.
