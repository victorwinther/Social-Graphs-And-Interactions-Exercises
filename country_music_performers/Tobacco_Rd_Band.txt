'''Tobacco Rd Band''' (TRB) is an American musical group that specializes in country-rock. The band, which is based in Tallahassee, Florida, consists of lead singer and songwriter Eric Durrance, lead guitarist Ben Castro, bass player Dale Shumate and drummer Joe Markham.

==History==
Tobacco Rd Band was founded in 2010 by Eric Durrance, who had previously been the lead singer with the acclaimed Christian rock band [[Big Dismal]], which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' once named one of "Five Christian Bands on the Rise."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strummagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49:eric&catid=34:music |accessdate=2013-09-17 |title=VUGA Enterprises Media Group }}</ref>

After Big Dismal broke up, Durrance began performing solo, and was selected to tour with [[Jason Aldean]] and [[Lady Antebellum]] as part of [[Country Music Television]]'s "CMT on Tour" in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Durrance To Open CMT ON TOUR 2008|url=http://www.countryhound.com/Eric-Durrance-To-Open-CMT-ON-TOUR-2008|publisher=Countryhound.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>  Durrance later formed TRB with his friend, lead guitarist Lex Vance. With its hard-driving sound coupled with Durrance's reputation from his years with Big Dismal, TRB quickly amassed a fan base throughout the South.

In early 2012, TRB released its debut EP titled "Where the Girls Are," which consisted of six tracks: "Where the Girls Are," "Jesus & Guns," "All About Me Today," "There's No Such Thing as Goodbye" and "Dear Life." Shortly thereafter, the band released the single "That's Country," featuring a guest performance by [[Colt Ford]], who also appears in the accompanying music video.<ref>{{cite web|title=615 Spotlight: Tobacco Rd Band Team Up With Colt Ford on 'That's Country'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/1538509/615-spotlight-tobacco-rd-band-team-up-with-colt-ford-on-thats|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>

In the summer of 2013, Durrance became the first artist to sign with Silvercreek Records, a new label in Nashville, which was founded by two Nashville music industry veterans—songwriter Stafond Seago and songwriter, producer and plugger Steve Pope.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silvercreek Records Opens on Music Row|date=13 August 2013 |url=http://www.musicrow.com/2013/08/silvercreek-records-opens-on-music-row/|publisher=Musicrow.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nashville Business Journal|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2013/08/13/silvercreek-records-label-launches-on.html|publisher=Bizjournals.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnewsnashville.com/eric-durrance-and-tobacco-rd-band-sign-with-silvercreek-records|title=Eric Durrance and Tobacco Rd Band Sign with Silvercreek Records|work=Music News Nashville|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> However, due to creative differences, Durrance negotiated a severance from Silvercreek and resumed recording under his own independent label, Big Southern Entertainment.

Durrance and Tobacco Rd Band continued writing songs and performing to sell-out crowds, primarily in the South, throughout 2014 and 2015.

In January 2016, Tobacco Rd Band released their song "Jesus & Guns" to country radio stations in response to President [[Barack Obama]]'s executive action on gun control. The pro-[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] ballad, which advocates the use of guns to protect one's family, had previously appeared on the band's 2012 album "Where the Girls Are."<ref>{{cite web|title=Tobacco Rd Band Releases JESUS & GUNS to Radio|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Tobacco-Rd-Band-Releases-JESUS-GUNS-to-Radio-20160115|publisher=Broadway World|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>
