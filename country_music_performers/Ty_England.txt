'''Gary Tyrone England''' (born December 5, 1963<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p146794/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Ty England biography |accessdate=July 8, 2008 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>) is an American [[country music]] singer and guitarist. Initially a member of [[Garth Brooks]]' band, England began his solo career in 1995, recording a self-titled debut album on [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]]. A second album, ''Two Ways to Fall'', followed in 1996. Three years later, he recorded ''Highways & Dance Halls'' under the name Tyler England on [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]], and ''Alive and Well and Livin' the Dream'' came in 2007 on the independent Triple T label. England has charted six singles on the country chart. His highest-charting single was his debut, "[[Should've Asked Her Faster]]", a No.&nbsp;3 hit in late 1995.

==Biography==
England began playing guitar during his youth. He sang with various bands in high school, and performed in his school chorus. While working at a coffee shop during his time as a student at [[Oklahoma State University]], fellow student [[Garth Brooks]] met him and soon the two were roommates. They performed together until failing grades forced England to move back home. He did eventually get a degree in marketing, but he worked at an automotive paint store.

By 1988, Garth had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and after landing a recording contract, called England to come be his guitarist and backup vocalist.
In 1995, England left Brooks' road band and signed to [[RCA Records]] Nashville. His self-titled [[Ty England (album)|debut album]], released in late 1995, produced his first chart single in the No.&nbsp;3 "Should've Asked Her Faster",<ref name="allmusic"/> although the album's other two singles ("Smoke in Her Eyes" and "Redneck Son") fell short of Top 40. A second album, ''[[Two Ways to Fall]]'', followed in 1996.<ref name="allmusic"/> It produced his only other Top 40 country hit in the No.&nbsp;22 "Irresistible You" followed by "All of the Above" at No.&nbsp;46. After the latter, England exited RCA's roster.

In 1999, England signed to [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]], the same label to which Brooks was signed at the time. His third album, ''[[Highways & Dance Halls]]'' was issued under the name Tyler England. It produced three singles in "Too Many Highways", "I Drove Her to Dallas" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;53) and "I'd Rather Have Nothing." Also included on this album was a re-recording of "Should've Asked Her Faster", as well as the [[Bruce Robison]] song "[[Travelin' Soldier]]", which would later become a Number One hit in 2003 for the [[Dixie Chicks]]. He did not release another album until 2007's ''Alive and Well and Livin' the Dream'',<ref name="allmusic"/> which included the non-charting singles "Redneck Anthem" and "The Perfect Girl."
