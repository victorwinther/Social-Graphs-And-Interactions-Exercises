==History==
[[File:FlynnvilleTrainHolmdelNJ2007.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Brent and Brian Flynn at the [[PNC Bank Arts Center]] on July 15, 2007]]
The band was officially signed to [[Show Dog Nashville]] on June 21, 2006, after five years of playing local venues independently. Said [[Toby Keith]] regarding his signing of the band: "As soon as I got the CD I put it on and was hooked. Right then I knew I had to see if Flynnville Train were as good performing live as they are on the disc. They were more than I could have expected and I signed them on the spot. You will hear great things from this band."<ref>[http://www.flynnvilletrain.com/band.htm Flynnville Train - Band<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Their self-titled debut album was released on September 11, 2007. It produced two charting singles with "Last Good Time" and "Nowhere Than Somewhere", which reached No.&nbsp;47 and No.&nbsp;50 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, respectively. A third single, "Tequila Sheila", failed to chart. A fourth single was released in 2009, intended to be the lead-off single to a new album, however, the single never charted and no album was released.

In April 2009, Flynnville Train and Show Dog Nashville parted ways.<ref>[http://www.showdognashville.com/index.php?page=artists Show Dog Nashville - Artists]</ref>

In July 2012, Flynnville Train released the single "The One You Love." The song was penned by Richard and Fred Young and Doug Phelps of [[The Kentucky Headhunters]]. Brent Flynn, Flynnville's lead guitarist relates: “Richard pitched it to us, and as soon as we heard it we knew we had to record it.  We've performed it live everywhere and the feedback from the fans has been amazing.”<ref name="Flynnville Train - Band"/>

The band signed with its current US label, AMP Entertainment in December 2012.

In August 2013, the band licensed its new album with the German label AGR Television Records, through its current US Label, AMP Entertainment.
