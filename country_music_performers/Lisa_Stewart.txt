==Life and career==
Stewart was born August 6, 1968, in [[Louisville, Mississippi]].<ref name="miss">{{cite web |url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/lisa-stewart.html |title=Lisa Stewart, Mississippi country singer |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |last=Glass |first=Paul |work=Mississippi Writers and Musicians}}</ref> She first sang in public at age six in her church. Five years later, she attended a Tent Show at the Nashville Fan Fair, where she gave her first country performance. By 1987, Stewart had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she won the Roy Acuff scholarship at Belmont University and found work as a studio singer.

While performing at a wedding reception in 1991, Stewart was noticed by Mark Thompson, [[Wynonna Judd]]'s bandleader, who asked Stewart to sing demos for him. After recording the demos, Stewart signed to a recording contract with BNA Entertainment (now known as [[BNA Records]]), releasing her debut single "Somebody's in Love" in late 1992. This song was the first of three singles from her self-titled debut album — which was released in January 1993 — followed by "Under the Light of the Texaco" and "Drive Time". Also included on the album was a cover of [[Jeannie Seely]]'s 1966 single "Don't Touch Me".

In addition to promoting her album on radio tours, Stewart hosted the nationally syndicated entertainment news show ''#1 Country''. She also made appearances on [[The Nashville Network]], hosting their programs ''Yesteryear'' and ''This Week in Country Music'' and was a featured performer on "Music City Tonight". 

In 1994, she recorded her second album for BNA. Produced by [[Barry Beckett]], the album was entitled <i>Solitary Heart</i>, and the first single was set to be "[[Let's Go to Vegas]]" (later a Top 5 hit for [[Faith Hill]]), but after a shakeup at the label, Stewart was dropped and the album was shelved. 

From 1997-1999, she co-hosted <i>This Week in Country Music</i> with Steve Phillips on TNN. She also continued to tour throughout the late 1990s.

Stewart began acting in the 21st century under her married name of Lisa Stewart Seals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/lisa-stewart-seals-movie/ |title=Lisa Stewart Seals Scores Role in Tim McGraw Movie |website=Theboot.com |date= 8 February 2010|accessdate=2020-04-04}}</ref> but is currently known as Lisa Stewart.

She is now making a mark in the jazz world and performs with her combo, often featuring Chester Thompson on drums (Genesis, Weather Report, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention).
