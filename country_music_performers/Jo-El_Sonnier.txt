By age six, Sonnier had performed on the radio; at age 11, he made his first recordings.<ref name="allmusic">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1812/biography|first=Jo-El|last=Sonnier|tab=Biography|label=Jo-El Sonnier Biography}}</ref> He also released several independent singles and four albums as a teenager.<ref name="allmusic"/> By the 1970s, he was signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]], but without much success in the country music field.

Sonnier temporarily abandoned his pursuit of a country music career in favor of recording Cajun music on the independent [[Rounder Records]] label.<ref name="sonnier"/> Although his independent album did not produce much commercial success, it was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name="allmusic"/> After being signed as [[Merle Haggard]]'s opening act, Sonnier later decided to return to country music; he was signed to [[RCA Records]] in the 1980s, where his biggest successes came in the singles "No More One More Time" and a cover of British singer [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]'s "[[Tear-Stained Letter]]", songs which landed in the Top 10 on the country charts.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In the 1990s, Sonnier moved to [[Capitol Records]], but his solo career faltered soon afterwards. He continued to find success as a session musician, and briefly took up acting as well.<ref name="allmusic"/> In the late 1990s, he returned to Rounder Records to record Cajun music once more, occasionally collaborating with [[Michael Doucet]] of [[BeauSoleil]]. Sonnier also saw his second Grammy nomination, for the 1997 album ''Cajun Pride''; a third soon followed with 2001's ''Cajun Blood'' being nominated for Best Traditional Folk Album.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 2009, Sonnier was inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]].{{cn|date=January 2024}}

On February 8, 2015, Sonnier won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Regional Roots Music Album.
