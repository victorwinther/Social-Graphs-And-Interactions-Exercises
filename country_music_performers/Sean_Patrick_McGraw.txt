'''Sean Patrick McGraw''', an American [[country music]] singer, is a former ''[[Nashville Star]]'' semi-finalist who leads a prominent unsigned touring act. Following the 2005 release of his CD ''Songs for Saturday Night'', McGraw and his band went on tour and continue to be on the road.  In 2007, McGraw played over 140 dates, from [[Toronto]] to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], garnering good reviews from critics and concert-goers alike.

Describing his music as "something like [[Lyle Lovett]] singing [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] songs while wearing [[Dwight Yoakam]]'s hat", McGraw has earned respect among songwriters as well. His song "Fiona" won top honors at the 2007 Independent Music Awards, first place at the American Songwriting Competition and at the Mountain Stages New Song Festival,<ref>(August 31, 2006). "Area man among NewSong winners", ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'', p. D13.</ref> as well as being named finalist in the [[International Songwriting Competition]] and the Mid-Atlantic Song Competition. An esteemed Music Row critic/columnist hailed "Fiona" as "The classiest country rocker I've heard all year." This cut and others from ''Songs For Saturday Night'' are featured in the short-length documentary''Ten Days on Tour'' which aired on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] in 2006.<ref>[http://www.seanpatrickmcgraw.com/blogs/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615182010/http://www.seanpatrickmcgraw.com/blogs/ |date=June 15, 2009 }}</ref>
