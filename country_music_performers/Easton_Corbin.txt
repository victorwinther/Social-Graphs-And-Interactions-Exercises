His song "[[Are You with Me]]" became an international hit in a remix version released by the Belgian DJ and record producer [[Lost Frequencies]].

==Biography==
Dan Easton Corbin is a native of Trenton, Florida. He lived on his grandparents' farm following his parents' divorce, and was introduced to [[country music]]-themed television programs such as ''[[Hee Haw]]''. After taking guitar lessons at 14 from session musician Pee Wee Melton at Dixie Music Center, he joined a band which won opening slots at a music festival and for [[Janie Fricke]] and [[Mel McDaniel]].

He attended the University of Florida's College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and earned an [[agribusiness]] degree, before marrying his wife, Briann, on September 2, 2006. They moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on October 14, 2006, where he worked at an [[Ace Hardware]] and performed at writers' nights.<ref name="weekly"/> A distant cousin who is a professor of entertainment management recommended him to contacts in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

On ''[[The Bobby Bones Show]]'' on September 3, 2013, Corbin mentioned that he is no longer married. He and Briann divorced in 2012.

==Music career==
===2005–2011: ''Easton Corbin''===
In 2005 Easton Corbin entered a contest at First Street Music in Lake City, Florida, for the Annual Suwannee River Jam. Former store owner Andy Temple recognized his talent and introduced him to songwriter friend Reese Wilson which was the start of his career. In 2008 Corbin recorded a six track demo CD with [[Nashville]] based songwriter Reese Wilson and producer Steve Davis; on the CD were three full instrument tracks and three acoustic tracks. The songs on the demo were "All About You", "I Ain't A Highway", "Missin' You", "Gettin' 'Got, Good", "Miracles Happen" and a cover of [[Hank Williams, Jr]]'s "Eleven Roses". Only a small number of the demo discs were pressed so the disc itself is very scarce and has become a highly sought after collectors item for hardcore fans. The tracks can be found digitally on YouTube. The tracks have never been added to any of Corbin's albums yet, making them still unreleased.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULw49jNpkN0|title=Easton Corbin – Missin' You (2008 Demo) Unreleased|date=September 27, 2015|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead YouTube link|date=February 2022}}</ref>

Joe Fisher, senior director of [[A&R]] at [[Universal Music Group Nashville]], signed Easton Corbin to the Mercury Nashville label in 2009. He released his debut single, "A Little More Country Than That", in July. [[Rory Lee Feek]] of [[Joey + Rory]] wrote the song with Don Poythress and [[Wynn Varble]].
