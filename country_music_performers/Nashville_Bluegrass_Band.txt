The '''Nashville Bluegrass Band''' is an American [[bluegrass music]] ensemble founded in 1984.

The group's members first played together in 1984 as a backing band for [[Vernon Oxford]] and [[Minnie Pearl]]; each of the members was an established musician from the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] bluegrass community.<ref name="agent">{{cite web|url=http://www.keithcase.com/profiles/Nash/index.htm|title=Nashville Bluegrass Band Biography|publisher=Keith Case & Associates|accessdate=August 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806025254/http://www.keithcase.com/profiles/Nash/index.htm|archivedate=August 6, 2010}}</ref> They signed to [[Rounder Records]] and recorded their [[Béla Fleck]]-produced debut, ''My Native Home'', in 1985. Incorporating elements of black [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s, then a rarity in bluegrass, they became critical and popular successes both in America and abroad. The group toured in some 20 countries and were the first bluegrass band to ever play in [[China]].<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p665/biography|pure_url=yes}} Nashville Bluegrass Band] at [[Allmusic]]</ref>

The group continued to record for Rounder and [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill]] into the 1990s; two of the albums, 1993's ''Waitin' for the Hard Times to Go'' and 1995's ''Unleashed'', won [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album|Grammy Awards for Best Bluegrass Album]].<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p665/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Grammy Awards], Allmusic.com</ref> Other albums were nominated for Grammys in the same category in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1998, and 2004.<ref name=amg/> After the departure of bassist Gene Libbea and mandolinist [[Roland White]] in 1998, the group went on a brief hiatus, but after vocalist Pat Enright sang as one of the [[Soggy Bottom Boys]] from ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', the group's career had a revival. They played as the backing group for many performers on the ''[[Down from the Mountain]]'' tour and album, and toured again on their own in the 2000s.
