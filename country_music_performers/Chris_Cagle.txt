He was first known for writing songs for [[David Kersh]] before signing to [[Virgin Records]] Nashville in 2000. Cagle made his debut on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts with "[[My Love Goes On and On]]", the first single from his debut album ''[[Play It Loud (Chris Cagle album)|Play It Loud]]''. The album, which was certified gold in the US, also produced the Top 10 "[[Laredo (Chris Cagle song)|Laredo]]" and "[[I Breathe In, I Breathe Out]]", his only No. 1 hit.

''Play It Loud'' was followed in 2002 by ''[[Chris Cagle (album)|Chris Cagle]]'', released on [[Capitol Records]] Nashville.

A fourth studio album, titled ''[[My Life's Been a Country Song]]'', was released in 2008, and its lead-off single, "[[What Kinda Gone]]", peaked at No. 3 on the country music chart in early 2008. After exiting Capitol in 2008, he signed with [[Bigger Picture Music Group]] in 2011, before retiring from music in 2015.

==Biography==
Christopher Norris Cagle was born in [[DeRidder, Louisiana]], on November 10, 1968;<ref name="allmusic"/> by the time he was 4, his family had moved to [[Sugar Land, Texas]], just outside [[Houston]]. He stayed there until moving to [[Baytown, Texas]], in high school.<ref name="whitburn"/><ref name="allmusic"/> During his high school years, he took piano lessons before switching to guitar. His senior year he moved to White Settlement, Texas, where he attended Brewer High School before moving back to Baytown and graduating from Ross S. Sterling High School in 1987. He attended the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] for one year. He skipped his finance courses to audit music classes, and performed at night in nearby clubs. He also spent a brief period attending classes at Lee College in Baytown.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|date=April 21, 2015|title=Chris Cagle will be the main show at the ECR|url=https://www.akronnewsreporter.com/2015/04/21/chris-cagle-will-be-the-main-show-at-the-ecr/|url-status=live|access-date=July 24, 2021|work=Akron News Reporter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724135657/https://www.akronnewsreporter.com/2015/04/21/chris-cagle-will-be-the-main-show-at-the-ecr/ |archive-date=July 24, 2021 }}</ref> Cagle later dropped out of college and moved to Nashville in 1994 at the behest of entertainment attorney Rod Phelps. Chris told Phelps that he "...had no place to live, no job, and no money." Phelps hired Cagle as a nanny for his and wife Sheila Wagnon's three daughters, Shayna, Ashley, and Tiffany. Chris remained for several months. While in Nashville, Cagle was waiting tables and tending bar while working to improve himself as a songwriter. One big break came when he met the legendary Harlan Howard, who was so impressed with Chris's songwriting progress that he was the first to publish one of his songs.<ref name="bio"/> Chris then landed a publishing deal and had songs recorded by [[David Kersh]]. A woman he met while waiting tables led him to [[Virgin Records]] head [[Scott Hendricks]], who signed him to a record deal.<ref name="bio"/>

==Musical career==
For the next five years he worked odd jobs throughout Nashville, eventually landing a songwriting deal and co-writing album tracks for [[David Kersh]].<ref name="allmusic"/> While working at a restaurant, he was discovered by an agent of the newly formed Nashville division of [[Virgin Records]], and was signed to a recording deal with the label in 2000.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===2000–2002: ''Play It Loud''===
Cagle's first album, ''[[Play It Loud (Chris Cagle album)|Play It Loud]]'', was issued in mid-2000. Serving as its lead-off single was "[[My Love Goes On and On]]", which reached No. 15 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]), while "[[Laredo (Chris Cagle song)|Laredo]]", its follow-up, became his first Top Ten hit in mid-2001.<ref name="whitburn"/> After Virgin closed in 2001, the album was re-issued on [[Capitol Records]] with "[[I Breathe In, I Breathe Out]]" (which was also one of the songs that he had written for David Kersh in the late 1990s) added as a bonus track. Its [[b-side]], "Country by the Grace of God", was the fourth and final single from the album. "I Breathe In, I Breathe Out" became his only No. 1 hit in early 2002. By the end of the year, ''Play It Loud'' had been certified gold in the United States.

===2003–2004: ''Chris Cagle''===
Capitol released Cagle's second album, ''[[Chris Cagle (album)|Chris Cagle]]'', in the middle of 2003. His second consecutive gold album, it produced the Top 5 singles "What a Beautiful Day" and "Chicks Dig It", as well as the No. 39 "I'd Be Lying".<ref name="whitburn"/>

In 2003, Cagle also performed "Don't Ask Me No Questions" for the ''[[Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie]]'' soundtrack; it plays during the end credits of the film.

In early 2004, Cagle was diagnosed with multiple anomalies on his [[vocal cords]], including a [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]], a [[lesion]], a [[vocal fold cyst]], and a [[granuloma]]. The diagnosis forced him to cancel nearly twenty appearances that year, including opening dates for [[Rascal Flatts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1484493/01212004/cagle_chris.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040125024458/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1484493/01212004/cagle_chris.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 25, 2004 |title=Chris Cagle Cancels Tour Dates: Lingering Vocal Cord Problems Force Announcement on Eve of Rascal Flatts Tour |access-date=February 2, 2008 |last=Gilbert |first=Calvin |date=January 2, 2004|work=Country Music Television}}</ref> He was ordered sixty days of [[vocal rest]] and did not sing for nearly three months after the diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1515118/11282005/cagle_chris.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427070929/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1515118/11282005/cagle_chris.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 27, 2006 |title=Chris Cagle: Cured but Still Intense: Singer Bounces Back From Vocal Ailment  |access-date=February 2, 2008 |last=Morris |first=Edward |date=November 2, 2005|work=Country Music Television}}</ref>

The other two singles — "Wal-Mart Parking Lot" and the title track, which had also been a single for [[Brice Long]] in 2005 – both failed to enter the Top 40.

In August 2006, a [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] judge ordered Cagle to pay approximately $737,000 to former manager Mark Hybner, whom Chris had sued in 2004 in an effort to void management and publishing deals he had signed in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2006/9/19/chris_cagle_loses_court_battle_with_manager |title=Chris Cagle loses court battle with manager |access-date=February 2, 2008 |last=Wood |first=E.
