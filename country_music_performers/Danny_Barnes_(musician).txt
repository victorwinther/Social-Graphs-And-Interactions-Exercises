==Early life==

He was inspired to learn to play the banjo after seeing [[Grandpa Jones]] and [[David "Stringbean" Akeman|Stringbean]] in concert when he was ten.<ref name= "BNL" >Nitchie, Donald.

==Career==
In 1990, while living in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Barnes formed the [[Bad Livers]] with [[upright bass|bass]]ist [[Mark Rubin (musician)|Mark Rubin]] and [[fiddler]] [[Ralph White]]. The band's 1992 debut album, ''Delusions of Banjer'', was produced by [[Paul Leary]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] and released on Quarterstick Records. It gained the band some attention in the alt-rock-country scene; they followed it up with another album for Quarterstick, ''Horses in the Mines'', released in 1994. The band then released three albums on the [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] label. During his tenure with the Bad Livers, he was acclaimed as "a prodigiously talented picker, and a glorious singer"<ref>Alden, Grant.

In 2000 Barnes, now living in Washington State, dissolved the Bad Livers and founded a new band, Danny Barnes & Thee Old Codgers, with bassist Keith Lowe and violinist Jon Parry. This band released only a single album, 2001's ''Things I Done Wrong'', which was produced by avant-garde jazz composer and pianist [[Wayne Horvitz]] (a fellow Seattle resident). 2002 saw Barnes working with jazz [[guitar]]ist [[Bill Frisell]]; Frisell was moving towards incorporating more "American"—country and bluegrass—influences into his playing, and he wanted Barnes to give him lessons in that direction. Their work together led to Barnes playing on Frisell's next album, ''The Willies''; Barnes also toured with Frisell in support of the album.

Since moving to Washington, Barnes has also recorded several solo albums, which were self-released, and a duet effort. His 2003 album ''Dirt on the Angel'', released on [[Terminus Records]], featured Frisell, [[Chuck Leavell]], [[Darol Anger]], and [[Dirk Powell]]. In 2004 Barnes participated in Wayne Horvitz's Mylab band and released his second CD for Terminus Records, ''Get Myself Together''.

On 9/21/2007, Danny joined Robert Earl Keen during an opening for the Dave Matthews Band in Houston. Danny joined DMB during their song "Bartender". He also joined DMB during their show at Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas, and at their two shows at the Hollywood Bowl in California to conclude DMB's summer 2007 tour. He joined the band onstage once again for their three-night stand at [[The Gorge Amphitheatre|The Gorge]] in 2009. He also joined them on stage on June 18, 2010 in Noblesville, Indiana.

In 2015, Barnes played and toured with the Jeff Austin Band. In September 2015, he was awarded the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass.<ref name= Itzkoff /> In an interview with ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', asked what he intended to do with the prize money, Barnes replied, "I'm going to invest it in my art."<ref name= Hall />

In 2017 and 2018, Barnes toured with mandolinist Joe K. Walsh and guitarist Grant Gordy as the Danny Barnes Trio.<ref>
