'''Woodward Maurice '''"'''Tex'''"''' Ritter''' (January 12, 1905 – January 2, 1974) was a pioneer of American [[Country music]], a popular singer and actor from the mid-1930s into the 1960s, and the patriarch of the Ritter acting family (son [[John Ritter]], grandsons [[Jason Ritter]] and [[Tyler Ritter]], and granddaughter Carly). He is a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

== Early life ==
Woodward Maurice Ritter was born on January 12, 1905, in [[Murvaul, Texas]],<ref name="cmhf">{{cite magazine|title=Tex Ritter: Movie Star, Recording Artist, All-Around Talent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52|access-date=August 18, 2023|magazine=Billboard|date=February 26, 1972|page=CMHF 22}}</ref> to Martha Elizabeth (''née'' Matthews) and James Everett Ritter. He grew up on his family's farm in [[Panola County, Texas]], and attended grade school in [[Carthage, Texas]]. He attended [[South Park High School (Beaumont, Texas)|South Park High School]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. After graduating with honors, he entered the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1922<ref name=cmhf2 /> to study pre-law and major in government, political science, and economics. After traveling to [[Chicago]]  with a musical troupe, he entered [[Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law|Northwestern Law School]].<ref name=cmhf />

== Career ==
=== Radio and Broadway ===
An early pioneer of country music, Ritter soon became interested in show business. In 1928, he sang on [[KPRC (AM)|KPRC]] in [[Houston, Texas]],<ref name="sies">Sies, Luther F. (2014). ''Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920–1960, 2nd Edition''. McFarland & Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-5149-4}}. P. 558.</ref> a 30-minute program of mostly cowboy songs. That same year, he moved to [[New York City]] and landed a job in the men's chorus of the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] show ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1928). He appeared as cowboy Cord Elam in the Broadway production ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' (1931),<ref name=cmhf2 /> the basis for the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' He also played the part of Sagebrush Charlie in ''The Round Up'' (1932)<ref>{{cite web|title="The Round Up" Cast|url=http://www.playbill.com/personlistpage/person-list?production=00000150-aea5-d936-a7fd-eef542ab0008&type=op#oc|website=Playbill Vault|access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> and ''[[Mother Lode]]'' (1934).

In 1932, he starred in New York City's first broadcast Western, ''The Lone Star Rangers'' on [[WOR (AM)|WOR]], where he sang and told tales of the [[Old West]]. Ritter wrote and starred in ''Cowboy Tom's Roundup'' on [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] in 1933, a daily children's cowboy program aired over two other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] stations for three years. He also performed on the radio show ''[[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] Barndance'' and sang on [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] shows; and appeared in several radio dramas, including [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS's]] ''[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders|Bobby Benson's Adventures]]''.<ref name=rp>Terrace, Vincent (1999). ''Radio Programs, 1924–1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows''. McFarland & Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4513-4}}. P. 48.</ref>

=== Movies ===
In 1936, Ritter moved to Los Angeles. His motion picture debut was in ''[[Song of the Gringo]]'' (1936) for [[Grand National Pictures]].<ref name=cmhf2 />  He went on to appear in 70 movies as an actor, and 76 on movie soundtracks.  He attracted special attention in 1952 for his rendition of "[[The Ballad of High Noon]]" over the opening credits of the celebrated film ''[[High Noon]]'', and later sang it at that year's [[25th Academy Awards|Academy Awards ceremony]], where it won [[25th Academy Awards#Awards|Best Original Song]].

=== Recording ===
Ritter's recording career was his most successful period. He was the first artist signed with the newly formed [[Capitol Records]] in 1942.<ref name=cmhf />

In 1944, he scored a hit with "[[I'm Wastin' My Tears on You]]", which hit number one on the country chart and number 11 on the pop chart. An article in the trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' noted 14 years later that with that song, he "reached the style of rhythmic tune that would assure his musical stature".<ref name="ges">{{cite magazine|title=Golden Era of Success|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyIEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Tex+Ritter%22&pg=PA46|access-date=December 26, 2016|magazine=Billboard|date=December 7, 1968|page=46}}</ref>

In 1952 Ritter recorded "[[The Ballad of High Noon]]" for the film ''[[High Noon]]''. He performed the track at the first televised [[Academy Awards]] ceremony in 1953, and it received an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Song]] that year.<ref>[http://users.pandora.be/davidneale/elvis/originals/list3.html#S27995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030141405/http://users.pandora.be/davidneale/elvis/originals/list3.html#S27995|date=October 30, 2007}}</ref>

=== Television ===
When television began to compete with movies for American audiences, Ritter began to make appearances on the new medium following 71 straight movie appearances. In 1953, he began performing on ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' on radio and television in Los Angeles. In 1957, he co-hosted ''Ranch Party'', a syndicated version of the show. He made his national TV debut in 1955 on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' and was one of five rotating hosts for its 1961 NBC-TV spin-off, ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]''.

=== Later work ===
Ritter became one of the founding members of the [[Country Music Association]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and spearheaded the effort to build the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] into which he was inducted in 1964.<ref name="cmhf2">{{cite web|title=Tex Ritter|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/artists/artist-detail/tex-ritter|website=Country Music Hall of Fame|access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>

He moved to Nashville in 1965 and began working for radio station [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]], earning a lifetime membership in the latter in 1970.<ref name=cmhf2 />

== Senate campaign ==
In 1970, Ritter entered Tennessee's Republican primary election for United States Senate. Despite high name recognition, he lost the nomination to United States Representative [[Bill Brock]], who then defeated the incumbent Senator [[Albert Gore, Sr]]. in the general election.

== Personal life ==

Ritter died of a heart attack in Nashville on January 2, 1974, at age 68. He was survived by his wife and two sons.  Ritter's son, John, became famous as an actor, playing [[Jack Tripper]] on the ABC sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (1977–1984). In 2003, John died, at the age of 54, of an [[aortic dissection]]. Because John was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack, and because aortic dissection is known to be hereditary, the family now believes that Tex died of an aortic dissection rather than a heart attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abc13.com/archive/7256482/|title=Actor John Ritter's wife brings message of awareness to condition that led to his death |website=Abc13.com|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
For his contribution to the recording industry, Ritter has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6631 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tex Ritter|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/tex-ritter|website=Hollywood Walk of Fame|access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> In 1980, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Western Performers|url=http://nationalcowboymuseum.org/awards-halls-of-fame/great-western-performers-2/|website=National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum|access-date=December 26, 2016|archive-date=July 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711035714/http://nationalcowboymuseum.org/awards-halls-of-fame/great-western-performers-2/|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. He was a member of the charter group of inductees into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]] in Carthage, in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=1998 Inductees...|url=http://carthagetexas.us/halloffame/inductees_98.htm|website=Texas Country Music Hall of Fame|access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>

In 1986, Ritter was honored posthumously with a [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]] for his work in Western films.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Boot Awards|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/goldboot.htm|website=B-Westerns.com|access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref>

Ritter can still be heard as the voice of Big Al, an [[audio-animatronic]] [[bear]], at [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney theme park]] attraction [[Country Bear Jamboree]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] at [[Walt Disney World]], and [[Tokyo Disneyland]] in [[Urayasu]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Japan]], and formerly at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]].
