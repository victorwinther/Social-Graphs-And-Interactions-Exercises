'''Harold Franklin''' "'''Hawkshaw'''" '''Hawkins''' (December 22, 1921 &ndash; March 5, 1963)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1106}}</ref> was an American [[country music]] singer popular from the 1950s into the early 1960s. He was known for his rich, smooth vocals and music drawn from [[blues]], [[boogie]] and [[honky tonk]]. At {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}} tall, Hawkins had an imposing stage presence, and he dressed more conservatively than some other male country singers. Hawkins died in the [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|1963 plane crash]] that also killed country stars [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Cowboy Copas]]. He was a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and was married to country star [[Jean Shepard]].

==Biography==
Harold Hawkins was born on December 22, 1921, in [[Huntington, West Virginia]], United States.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He gained his nickname as a boy after helping a neighbor track down two missing fishing rods: the neighbor called him "Hawkshaw" after the title character in the comic strip, ''[[Hawkshaw the Detective]]''. He traded five trapped rabbits for his first guitar, and performed on [[WCMI (AM)|WCMI-AM]] in [[Ashland, Kentucky]]. At 16, he won a talent competition and a job on [[WRVC (AM)|WSAZ-AM]] in Huntington, where he formed Hawkshaw and Sherlock with Clarence Jack. They moved to [[WCHS (AM)|WCHS-AM]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], in the late 1930s.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1940, at 19, he married Reva Mason Barbour, a 16-year-old from Huntington.<ref name="Cesario, Guy">{{cite web | url = http://www.patsyclinetribute.com/hawk.htm | title = Patsy Cline: A Fan's Tribute | author = Cesario, Guy|website=Patsyvlinetribute.com | access-date = March 30, 2009}}</ref>

During 1941, Hawkins traveled the United States with a musical revue. He entered the [[U.S. Army]] in 1943 during [[World War II]], and served as an engineer stationed near [[Paris, Texas]], where he and friends performed at local clubs.<ref name="Cesario, Guy"/>  As a staff sergeant, he was stationed in [[France]] and fought in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], winning four battle stars during 15 months of combat.<ref name="Cesario, Guy"/> He was also stationed in [[Manila]] and performed there on the radio.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

===Postwar success===
After he was discharged, Hawkins became a regular on ''[[WWVA Jamboree]]'' from 1945 to 1954 in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1946, he signed a recording contract with [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in [[Cincinnati]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  This nearly never happened, as [[Syd Nathan]] almost threw his poorly-made demonstration record away without listening to it.  However, upon listening Nathan agreed to record four Hawkins sides in West Virginia.<ref name=king>{{cite book |last=McNutt |first=Randy |date=2009 |title=King Records of Cincinnati |location=Charleston, South Carolina |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=15 |isbn=978-0-7385-6079-3}}</ref>  His first two recordings with King, "Pan American" and "Dog House Boogie", were top ten country hits.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> A minor hit, and the song that become his signature tune, was "The Sunny Side of the Mountain."<ref name="LarkinGE"/> "Slow Poke", recorded in 1951, was another notable King recording.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He stayed with the label until 1953.

Because of his height of six feet, five inches and his outgoing personality, he was christened "Eleven Yards of Personality".<ref name=king />

In 1951, Hawkins and his wife adopted four-year old Susan Marlene. They divorced in 1958 and Susan traveled back and forth between her parents in summers and for holidays.

Beginning in 1954, Hawkins was a regular performer on [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|TV]]'s ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where he met his second wife, [[Jean Shepard]].<ref>''Ozark Jubilee Souvenir Picture Album'' (first edition, 1955)</ref> After a few years with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and [[RCA Records]], he joined the Grand Ole Opry and returned to King; and in 1962 he recorded his biggest hit, "[[Lonesome 7-7203]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> It first appeared on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]] as a March 2, 1963, release, three days before Hawkins died.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The song was absent from the charts for the two weeks following his death, but re-appeared on March 23 and spent 25 weeks on the chart, four of them at No. 1, an accomplishment that eluded him in life.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

===Aircraft accident===
{{Main|1963 Camden PA-24 crash}}
On March 3, 1963, Hawkins, [[Patsy Cline]] and Cowboy Copas performed at a benefit concert at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas, for the family of disc jockey "Cactus" Jack Call, who had died in January after an automobile accident. Among the performers was [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]], who received an urgent phone call and needed to return to Nashville immediately. Hawkins gave Walker his commercial airline ticket and instead flew back in a private plane in Walker's place.

On March 5, Hawkins, Cline and Copas left for Nashville in a [[Piper Comanche]] piloted by Randy Hughes, Cline's manager (and Copas's son-in-law). After stopping to refuel in Dyersburg, Tennessee, the craft took off at 6:07&nbsp;p.m. CT. The plane flew into severe weather and crashed at 6:29&nbsp;p.m. in a forest near Camden, Tennessee, 90 miles from Nashville. There were no survivors. Fans around the world mourned the loss; Hawkshaw was survived by his daughter Susan Marlene, his young son Donnie, and his wife Jean Shepard, who was pregnant at the time with their second son, Harold Franklin Hawkins I. Hawk Jr.,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> who was born one month after his father's death.

Hawkins was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens]] in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, in Music Row with Copas and other country music stars.

==Legacy==
The location of the airplane crash in the still-remote forest outside Camden is noted by a stone marker, dedicated on July 6, 1996.

Hawkins is remembered in "Love Never Dies" on [[Martin Simpson]]'s 2003 album, ''Righteousness and Humidity''. In the song, Simpson meets an old truck driver who used to play guitar: "I gave old Hawkshaw a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] one time, it was a [[Gibson J-200|J-200]], man, such a sweet neck! And they say it stood up like a country grave marker, right there in the middle of that plane wreck."
