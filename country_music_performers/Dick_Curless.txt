==Biography==
Curless was born in [[Fort Fairfield, Maine]], United States, and moved with his family to [[Massachusetts]] at the age of eight.<ref name="Larkin"/> He began his music career in 1948 in [[Ware, Massachusetts]], where he hosted a [[radio show]] and toured with a local band called the Trail Blazers.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Curless married his wife, Pauline, in 1951, and only six months after the wedding, he was drafted into the [[United States Army]]. He served in the [[Korean War]] from 1952 to 1954, first as a [[truck driver]] and later as a radio host with the stage name "Rice Paddy Ranger".<ref name="Larkin"/>

Curless returned home to Maine in 1954 and continued performing on radio shows, but he spent much of the following year, 1955, at home due to a chronic illness.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In 1957, Curless returned to the public spotlight and appeared on the [[CBS]] television show ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> He spent much of the late 1950s performing in clubs in California and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] but occasionally returned home to Maine to recover from periods of illness and fatigue.<ref name="Larkin"/> While in Maine, Curless recorded several singles, including "China Nights" at Event Records with [[Al Hawkes]]. Eventually he temporarily left the music industry and bought his own lumber trucking vehicle in Maine.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In 1965, Curless recorded one of the biggest hits of his career, "[[A Tombstone Every Mile]]", which cracked the top 5 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' country charts]] and propelled him to national fame.<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1966, he recorded the album ''A Devil Like Me Needs an Angel Like You'' with [[Kay Adams (singer)|Kay Adams]]. From 1966 to 1968, he toured the nation with the ''Buck Owens All American Show''. The pinnacle of his career came in the late 1960s with eleven top-40 hits, including "Six Times a Day (the Trains Came Down)".<ref name="Larkin"/> Altogether, he recorded 22 ''Billboard'' top-40 hits throughout his career.

After Curless' success in 1970 with the hits "[[Big Wheel Cannonball]]" and "Hard, Hard Traveling Man", he recorded infrequently until he released the albums ''Welcome to My World'' and ''It's Just a Matter of Time'' in [[Norway]] in 1987. The albums were successful in Europe, especially in Norway and Germany.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Curless recorded an album with German country musician [[Tom Astor]] in 1991. During the later part of his life, he performed often at the Cristy Lane Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]].

Curless died of [[stomach cancer]] in 1995, aged 63.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/obituaries/dick-curless-63-a-country-singer.html?mcubz=1|title=Dick Curless, Country Singer, Aged 63|date=May 28, 1995|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[The Associated Press]]|accessdate=October 14, 2019}}</ref>
