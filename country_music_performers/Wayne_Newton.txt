In 1963, he achieved [[Headliner (performances)|headliner]] status at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]], a casino hotel in Las Vegas, and soon became one of the city's most popular performers. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' describes Newton as "America's number one night club act" and at his peak being more prominent in Las Vegas than both Sinatra and Presley.<ref>{{cite news| title=This is the only Wayne Newton story you need to read|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/10/19/this-is-the-only-wayne-newton-story-you-need-to-read/| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2022-12-01| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Newton is the highest-grossing entertainer in Las Vegas history.<ref name="Esquire" /> Throughout his career, Newton has appeared in a number of movies and television shows.

===Early career===
Wayne Newton and his brother performed at The Flamingo for five years doing six shows for six days a week. Newton credits his ability to base his performances on what the crowd wanted to hear for his early success in Las Vegas.<ref name="AZCentral" /> In 1962, Newton performed the Irish folk song "[[Danny Boy]]" for [[Jackie Gleason]] in Phoenix.<ref name="AZCentral" /> Impressed by Newton's performance, Gleason told Newton "don't go on any other television show before you go on mine."<ref name="AZCentral" /> On September 29, 1962, the brothers first performed on ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]''.<ref name="AZCentral" /> Over the next two years, Newton would perform on Gleason's show 12 times, which were his first appearances on national television. In the early to mid-1960s, Newton also acted and sang as "Andy," the baby-faced Ponderosa ranchhand, on the classic western TV series ''[[Bonanza]]''. During the filming of ''Bonanza'', Newton first met [[Elvis Presley]] (who was filming another show on the same set) and they went on to become good friends.<ref name="Esquire" />

In 1962, Jackie Gleason organized an engagement between Newton and the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. There Newton first met [[Bobby Darin]].<ref name="AZCentral" /> Darin, who was impressed by Newton, agreed to produce Newton's records.<ref name="AZCentral" /> By 1963 Newton had been signed to [[Capitol Records]], and his first album was released on the label.<ref name="AZCentral" /> Newton's hit song "[[Danke Schoen]]" was originally written for Darin to sing,<ref name="AZCentral" /> however Darin was intent on Newton having a hit song of his own and gave it to him.<ref name="AZCentral" /> "Danke Schoen" went on to reach No. 13 on the Hot 100.

Many other prominent entertainment icons such as [[Lucille Ball]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[George Burns]], and [[Jack Benny]] lent Newton their support. For example, after Benny saw Newton performing at a nightclub in [[Sydney, Australia]], he hired him to perform an opening act for a booking he had at [[Harrah's Reno]]. Benny then hired Newton as an opening act for his comedy show in Las Vegas and to perform on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', which Newton did for five years. After his job with Benny ended, Newton was offered a job to open for another comic at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]] but Newton asked for, and was given, a headline act in 1963.<ref name="LVS 2008-05-15">{{Cite news| url=https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/evolution-worlds-entertainment-capital/| title=Showtime: How Sin City evolved into 'The Entertainment Capital of the World'| last1=Koch| first1=Ed| last2=Manning| first2=Mary| date=May 15, 2008| newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]| access-date=March 3, 2019|last3=Toplikar|first3=Dave}}</ref>  In 1965, Newton performed on ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' as a country boy singing to animals.<ref name="CloserWeekly">{{cite web |url=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/wayne-newton-reveals-best-lesson-he-learned-from-frank-sinatra/|title=Wayne Newton Reveals the Best Life Lesson He Learned From Frank Sinatra and Others: 'Be Disciplined' |website=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] |date=July 21, 2019 |access-date=January 22, 2022}}</ref> Impressed with Newton's performance, [[CBS]] offered Newton his own TV show around this character.<ref name="CloserWeekly" /> However, Newton declined the offer, at the urging of [[Lucille Ball]], who told Newton unless "you want to be this country boy the rest of your life, turn this series down..."<ref name="CloserWeekly" />

Newton was known for his distinctive high-pitched voice, which stayed with him for most of his career, although his voice did lower somewhat in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wayne-newton-mn0000252495/biography |title=Wayne Newton |first=John |last=Bush |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 2, 2020}}</ref> In the 1970s, Newton began focusing on primarily performing in Las Vegas.

Following the death of [[Elvis Presley]] and the aging of many members of the [[Rat Pack]], Newton emerged as the biggest entertainer in Las Vegas.<ref name="LVS 2008-05-15" /> In the 1970s, Newton performed primarily at the [[Desert Inn]], [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|The Frontier]] and [[Sands Hotel and Casino]].<ref name="LVS 2008-05-15" /> Newton holds the record for total crowd counts during his peak.<ref name="LVS 2008-05-15" />

''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' described Newton as "the biggest moneymaker in the history of Vegas. Nobody has drawn like that week in, week out. Not Elvis, not [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]]. There's just no comparison."<ref name="Esquire" /> Newton's shows were especially popular in Las Vegas because of their length - often lasting up to three hours - which stood out in comparison to the short length of many headliners' shows at the time in Las Vegas.<ref name="Esquire" />

In 1972, his recording of "[[Daddy, Don't You Walk So Fast]]" sold more than one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in July 1972.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/83 83]| isbn=978-0-2142-0512-5| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/83}}</ref> The song peaked at No. 4 in the United States and No. 1 in Australia and Canada, while the album of the same name peaked at No. 25 on the album charts.<ref name=aus>{{cite book| last=Kent| first=David| author-link=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970–1992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book |location=St Ives, N.S.W.| year=1993| isbn=978-0-6461-1917-5| page=217}}</ref>

On May 23, 1989, Newton's live stage show was broadcast as a [[pay-per-view]] event called ''[[Wayne Newton Live in Concert]]''. Newton did not perform his trademark songs "[[Danke Schoen]]" or "[[Red Roses for a Blue Lady]]," however he closed the show with a special finale of "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]" which culminated with an onstage rainfall.

On December 12, 1992, Newton hit No. 1 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' Pop and Country charts with an Elvis-inspired song "[[The Letter (Wayne Newton song)|The Letter]]."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/90s_files/1992.html |title=Cash Box Top Singles - 1992 |magazine=Cashbox |access-date=2015-08-26}}</ref> Controversy swirled around this chart feat as "The Letter" did not chart at all on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s authoritative Hot 100 chart, Adult Contemporary chart, or "Bubbling Under" chart. It did not make the ''[[Radio & Records]]'' chart either. This marked the first and only time in history that a record hit #1 on the ''Cashbox'' Top 100 chart yet failed to chart on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jabartlett.wordpress.com/2008/12/12/mystery-letter/ |title=Top 5: Mystery Letter &#124; The Hits Just Keep On Comin' |publisher=Jabartlett.wordpress.com |date=2008-12-12 |access-date=2015-08-26}}</ref>

The "headliner-in-residence" deal was the first of its kind. In 2005, in preparation for the eventual demolition of the Stardust Casino, the deal was amicably terminated. His last show at the Stardust was on April 20, 2005.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-04-07-wayne-newton_x.htm| work=USA Today| title=Wayne Newton leaving longtime Vegas stint| date=April 7, 2005}}</ref> In his final performance at the Stardust, Newton sang nearly his entire repertoire and songs of other Vegas mainstays as well.

He bought his first horse when he sold his bicycle and his parents' movie camera to buy a foal when he was a sixth-grader. Originally owning [[Thoroughbred]]s and [[American Quarter Horses]], he "fell in love" with the Arabian breed via his ownership of the Champion stallion Aramus, after whom he named his horse ranch.<ref name=McCall/>  He first came to the attention of Arabian breeders in 1969 when he partnered with Tom Chauncey, an Arabian breeder and television station owner, to purchase the stallion [[Naborr]] from the estate of Anne [[McCormick family|McCormick]].<ref name=Lauter/> They paid $150,000, which at the time was the highest price ever paid for an Arabian horse at auction.<ref name=Reif>{{cite news| last1=Reif| first1=Rita| title=Art Upstage by Horses at an Arizona Auction| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/us/art-upstage-by-horses-at-an-arizona-auction.html| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| access-date=12 November 2015| date=February 16, 1982| url-access=subscription}}</ref>  Shortly thereafter, Newton formed a partnership with other Arabian breeders to purchase Aramus, who was a son of Naborr.

Newton was given the Arabian Horse Breeders' Alliance (AHBA) Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007 during the first Arabian Breeder's World Cup in Las Vegas.<ref name=Lauter>{{cite web| last1=Lauter| first1=Jo West| title=2007 LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD: To Mr. Wayne Newton . . .

He was awarded the Arabian Professional and Amateur Horseman's Association Breeder of the Year award in 1996.<ref name=McCall/>

===Charitable causes===
Newton was featured in the production of "You Can't Say Love Enough" (1996), an all-star single, also featuring [[Dolly Parton]], [[Heidi Newfield]] and several other artist-celebrities; this production served to raise funds for diabetes research.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Two Faces of Diabetes| url=http://diabeteshealth.com/read/2008/03/13/694/the-two-faces-of-diabetes/| website=Diabeteshealth.com| access-date=Aug 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release| title=Children With Diabetes - Country Superstars Support JDRF| url=http://www.mj2twins.com/page/13| website=Mj2twins.com| access-date=Aug 28, 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=You Can't Say Love Enough + MJ2 and 18 Celebrity Friends| url=http://www.mj2twins.com/post/67005372962/ycsle| website=Mj2twins.com| access-date=Aug 28, 2014| archive-date=September 3, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903072639/http://www.mj2twins.com/post/67005372962/ycsle| url-status=dead}}</ref> Concurrently, the Wayne Newton Research Grant awarded by the American Diabetes Association was created.

In 2001, Newton succeeded [[Bob Hope]] as chairman of the [[United Service Organizations]] Celebrity Circle, a nonprofit-charitable corporation that provides live entertainment to members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and their families. Newton was the grand marshal of the 80th Annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival in [[Winchester, Virginia]] from May 1–7, 2007.<ref>[http://www.thebloom.com/celebrities.html#newton "SABF Celebrities"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319111033/http://www.thebloom.com/celebrities.html#newton|date=March 19, 2007}}. ''80th Annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival''.</ref> He canceled a sold-out show to join the Festival. In 2008, Newton received a [[Woodrow Wilson Awards|Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service]]. The [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], a national memorial to President Wilson, commemorates "the ideals and concerns of [[Woodrow Wilson]]." The award honors leaders who have given back to their communities.

===Finances and legal problems===
From 1980 to 1982, Newton was part owner of the [[Aladdin, Las Vegas|Aladdin Hotel]], in a partnership that led to a number of lawsuits and a failed attempt by Newton to purchase the entire hotel in 1983.<ref>Zekan, Karen (November 25, 1997). [http://www.lasvegassun.com/dossier/events/aladdin/history2.html "Aladdin's Lamp Burns Out"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207051528/http://www.lasvegassun.com/dossier/events/aladdin/history2.html|date=February 7, 2006}}. ''Las Vegas Sun''. Accessed September 4, 2022/</ref>

In 1992, Newton filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] to reorganize an estimated $20 million in debts, much of which was accumulated while suing NBC for libel; he claimed the network had reported that he partnered with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] to buy the Aladdin. His bankruptcy declaration included a $341,000 [[Internal Revenue Service]] [[tax lien]]. By 1999, he was financially well off again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwaytovegas.com/October31,1999.html |title=Newton Rolling in Dough |date=October 31, 1999 |first=Laura |last=Deni |website=Broadway to Vegas |access-date=2022-09-04}}</ref>

In August 2005, the IRS filed a lawsuit against Newton alleging that he and his wife owed more than $1.8 million in taxes and penalties. One of Newton's tax lawyers disputed that, saying, "We believe the IRS owes him money."<ref name="reviewjournal">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-aug-04-wk-quick4.5-story.html |title=Newton takes on back-taxes claim |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2005-08-05 |df=mdy |access-date=2022-09-04}}</ref>

In late 2009, officials at [[Oakland County International Airport]] in Waterford, Michigan, claimed Newton owed the airport more than $60,000 for unpaid parking fees, which they claimed he owed after having abandoned a $2 million [[Fokker F28]] plane there more than three years before.<ref name="reviewjournal" /> The plane was originally flown in for renovations in 2005. After they were completed in 2007, the plane was moved to an outside parking area. The monthly parking fees were $5,000. An aircraft of this type needs to have its engines run at least once a month to retain its airworthiness.<ref>{{cite news| title=Wayne Newton's abandoned jet rots at Michigan airport| url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/04/wayne-newtons-abandoned-jet-rots-michigan-airport/| date=February 4, 2010| newspaper=Las Vegas Sun| agency=Associated Press| access-date=September 4, 2022}}</ref> The plane has since been disassembled, transported, and reassembled on his estate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/08/27/wayne-newton-abandoned-jet-return-las-vegas/ |title=Wayne Newton – Park My Jet On My Lawn |website=[[TMZ]] |date=August 29, 2010 |access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref>

In February 2010, [[Bruton Smith]] sued Newton, claiming he was delinquent on a loan he had personally guaranteed, then bought from [[Bank of America]]. Smith sought [[foreclosure]] of Newton's Las Vegas ranch Casa de Shenandoah.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/17/former-friend-seeks-foreclose-singer-wayne-newtons/| title=2010 Former friend seeks to foreclose on singer Wayne Newton's home| date=February 17, 2010| newspaper=Las Vegas Sun| access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref> That same month, Clark County sheriff's deputies were refused entry to Newton's ranch. The officers attempted to serve civil papers and seize property as part of a $501,388 judgment against Newton awarded to Monty Ward, his former personal pilot, but security personnel employed by Newton refused to accept the papers. Ward, who filed suit in 2006, won the judgment for past-due wages in January 2009.<ref name="sun">{{cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/25/moving-vans-seen-wayne-newtons-las-vegas-home/ |title=Officers denied entry at Wayne Newton's Las Vegas home |last=Green |first=Steve |date=2010-02-25 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |access-date=2010-07-25}}</ref>

Newton was enmeshed in another lawsuit over a stalled project to convert his 40-acre home into a museum. In this lawsuit, a developer claimed he purchased Newton's home and paid the singer $19.5 million, with the understanding that Newton would move out and allow the property to be converted into a museum. The developer claimed that he had invested $50 million on the project, but that Newton had failed to move out and had deliberately thwarted construction efforts.<ref>Toplikar, Dave (October 3, 2012).

On December 17, 2012, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Bruce Markell approved the sale of Wayne Newton's estate, Casa de Shenandoah, to be listed for sale by Nathan and Associates, a Las Vegas brokerage firm. Bankruptcy papers placed the value of the property at $50.8 million.<ref>O'Reiley, Tim (December 18, 2012).

Retrieved December 18, 2012</ref> The property remained on the market, until 2015, when Newton reached an accord with Lacy Harber, the businessman who owned 70% of the corporation that had purchased Casa de Shenandoah to turn it into a museum. Newton and his family moved back into the property, and in September 2015, after construction of a museum to house memorabilia, it was opened for public tours.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/sep/21/mr-las-vegas-is-back-wayne-newton-returns-to-shena/| title=Mr. Las Vegas is back: Wayne Newton returns to Shenandoah| date=September 21, 2015| newspaper=Las Vegas Sun| access-date=October 27, 2017}}</ref> On April 26, 2018, the property hosted its last public event before closing indefinitely for renovations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/casa-de-shenandoah-hosts-last-event-before-it-closes-for-renovations/1145653068 |title=Casa de Shenandoah hosts last event before it closes for renovations |first=Nikki |last=Bowers |website=[[KLAS-TV|KLAS News]] |date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>
