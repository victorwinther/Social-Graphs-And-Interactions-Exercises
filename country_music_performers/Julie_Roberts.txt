==Biography==
Julie Roberts was born in [[Lancaster, South Carolina]], United States, in 1979. The daughter of an engineer and accountant, she began her life performing in [[pre-school]] plays. She also was in school choirs and performed in a rendition of "My Fair Lady" at a singing summer camp. Roberts began performing country music as a child. When she was in junior high and high school, she toured with her family, playing at festivals in [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. She also performed at area nursing homes (where she developed an appreciation for [[blues music]]); and worked at [[Carowinds]] (a theme park in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]) and [[Dollywood]]. She also worked with 60- and 70-year-old men performing at nursing homes. Her influences include [[Dolly Parton]], [[Barbara Mandrell]] and [[Tanya Tucker]].

She first attended [[University of South Carolina Lancaster|USC Lancaster]] in her hometown from 1997 to 1999 before graduating from [[Belmont University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with a degree in business administration. Roberts performed in local clubs and restaurants until graduation, she began working for [[Mercury Nashville Records]], later becoming assistant to label head Luke Lewis. During her tenure there, she recorded a demo tape with producer Brent Rowan during her off-time. Rowan eventually played the tape for Lewis, who was favorably impressed by the recording.

===Country music career===
Roberts was signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville]]'s Mercury Nashville division. Her debut single, "[[Break Down Here]]", was released on February 24, 2004. The song had previously been recorded by [[Trace Adkins]] under the title "I'd Sure Hate to Break Down Here". Roberts released her self-titled [[Julie Roberts (album)|debut album]] on May 25, 2004. It charted within the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;9. "Break Down Here" became a Top 20 single on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, however, she never charted within the Top 40 after that. The two follow-up singles, "The Chance" and "Wake Up Older", peaked at No.&nbsp;47 and No.&nbsp;46 on the country charts, respectively. The album was then certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on December 13, 2004.

In 2006, she released her fourth single, "Men & Mascara", which would in-turn be the title track to her second album. ''[[Men & Mascara]]'' was released on June 27, 2006. Although not charting a single from this album, it managed to chart even higher than her debut album. It reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Top Country Albums and No.&nbsp;25 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Included on the album is a [[cover version]] of [[Saving Jane]]'s "[[Girl Next Door (Saving Jane song)|Girl Next Door]]", however, it failed to chart along with the album's title track.

Roberts and Mercury Records parted ways at the beginning of May 2010. She released her third album "Alive" on June 7 as an independent artist, with the first single being "NASCAR Party".

In 2011, Roberts revealed that she was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/julie-roberts-multiple-sclerosis/|title=Julie Roberts Combats M.S. With Health and Fitness|first=Stephen L.|last=Betts|website=The Boot|date=August 17, 2012 }}</ref>

Her album ''Good Wine & Bad Decisions'' was the first full release for the label in 40 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/julie-roberts-first-artist-to-sign-with-sun-records-in-40-years/ |title=Julie Roberts First Artist To Sign With Sun Records in 40 years |access-date=July 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429093311/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/julie-roberts-first-artist-to-sign-with-sun-records-in-40-years/ |archive-date=April 29, 2014 }}</ref>

===Charities===

==''The Voice'' (2013)==
In 2013, Julie Roberts took part in the Blind Auditions of [[The Voice (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] of the reality television show ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''. In the third Blind Audition episode broadcast on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] on April 1, 2013, she sang a cover of [[Blake Shelton]]'s version of the [[Dave Barnes]] song "[[God Gave Me You]]". None of the four judges, [[Adam Levine]], [[Shakira]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] or Blake Shelton pressed their "I Want You" buttons to turn their chairs and she did not qualify to the following rounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotcountryonline.com/|title=Got Country Online – Bringing you the latest country music news & reviews}}</ref> Shelton immediately recognized the contestant and introduced her by name to the other judges.
