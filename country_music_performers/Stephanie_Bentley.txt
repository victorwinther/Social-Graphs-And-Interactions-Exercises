'''Stephanie Kay Bentley''' (born April 29, 1963) is an American [[country music]] artist. She made her debut in 1996 as a duet partner on [[Ty Herndon]]'s single "Heart Half Empty", which peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. The single was included both on Herndon's 1995 debut album ''[[What Mattered Most]]'' and on Bentley's 1996 debut album ''[[Hopechest]]''. It produced three more singles for her on the country charts, although only one ("Who's That Girl") reached Top 40.

Bentley found success as a songwriter, having penned [[Faith Hill]]'s 1999 crossover single "[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]", as well as [[Martina McBride]]'s 2002 Top 5 hit "[[Concrete Angel]]". She has also co-written album cuts for [[Céline Dion]], [[Pam Tillis]] and [[Jo Dee Messina]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umusicpub.com/spotlight.aspx?id=708 |title=The Songs of Stephanie Bentley |website=www.umusicpub.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508042736/http://www.umusicpub.com/spotlight.aspx?id=708 |archive-date=8 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and recorded "I Will Survive" for the 2003 film ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]'' and "Don't It Feel Good" for the 2005 film ''[[Must Love Dogs]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bentley was born in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] and her musical interests began at age nine, when she, her sister, and a friend entered and won a talent contest. The three later toured briefly as a musical group, even singing for President [[Jimmy Carter]],<ref name="media">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p55988|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic ((( Stephanie Bentley > Overview )))]</ref> In 1984, she formed a band called Special Delivery.<ref name="cst">{{Cite web|url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=281|title=Stephanie Bentley hopes debut brings chestful of success – January 1996|website=Countrystandardtime.com|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>

===Move to Tennessee===
In 1991, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she worked as a demo singer. One of the songs for which she sang a demo was "[[Shake the Sugar Tree]]", which later became a Top 5 hit when [[Pam Tillis]] recorded it for her 1992 album ''[[Homeward Looking Angel]]''. Bentley's demo vocals were dubbed into Tillis' recording of the song.<ref name="media"/><ref name="cst"/>

===1995–1997: Ty Herndon duet and ''Hopechest''===
After a failed deal with [[Liberty Records]] which produced no albums or singles, Bentley signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1995. Her first chart entry in 1996 was as a duet partner on [[Ty Herndon]]'s single "Heart Half Empty", (from his debut album ''[[What Mattered Most]]'') which peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts.<ref name="cst"/> "Heart Half Empty" was followed by her first solo release for Epic, "Who's That Girl", which peaked at No.&nbsp;32. This was the first single from her debut album ''[[Hopechest]]'', issued by Epic that year. The album produced three more singles after "Who's That Girl", although these latter three singles—"Once I Was the Light of Your Life", "The Hopechest Song" and "Dead Ringer"—all failed to make Top 40.

===1997–present: Songwriting===
Although Bentley never charted or recorded an album after 1997, she found success writing songs for others, most notably "[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]" by [[Faith Hill]], which spent six weeks at the top of the ''Billboard'' country music charts in late 1999-early 2000 and became the Number One song of 2000 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] year-end countdown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20010828stephanie_bentley_a_little_riff_brings_big_success_to_stephanie|title=A Little Riff Brings Big Success to Stephanie Bentley|date=August 27, 2001|website=BMI.com|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Bentley also co-wrote [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s 1998 single "I'm Not That Easy to Forget" with George Teren and [[Chris Waters]] and [[Martina McBride]]'s 2002 single "[[Concrete Angel]]" with [[Rob Crosby]]. In addition, she wrote two singles for [[Gloriana (band)|Gloriana]]: "[[Wild at Heart (Gloriana song)|Wild at Heart]]" in 2009 with [[Josh Kear]] and [[Matt Serletic]], and "[[Can't Shake You]]" in 2012 with Tom Gossin and [[James T. Slater]]. Bentley also contributed the songs "I Will Survive" for the soundtrack of the 2003 film ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]'' and "Don't It Feel Good" for the soundtrack of the 2005 film ''[[Must Love Dogs]]''.
