'''Mark Wills''' (born '''Daryl Mark Williams'''; August 8, 1973)<ref name=BMI-RepertoireProfile>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/Catalog.aspx?detail=writerid&page=1&fromrow=1&torow=25&keyid=858397&subid=0|title=Songwriter/Composer: Wills, Mark; Current Affiliation: GEMA CAE/IPI #: 247006588|work=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]]}}</ref> is an American [[country music]] artist. Signed to [[Mercury Records]] between 1996 and 2003, he released five studio albums for the label – ''[[Mark Wills (album)|Mark Wills]]'', ''[[Wish You Were Here (Mark Wills album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', ''[[Permanently]]'', ''[[Loving Every Minute (album)|Loving Every Minute]]'', and ''[[And the Crowd Goes Wild]]'' – as well as a [[Greatest Hits (Mark Wills album)|greatest hits]] package. In that same timespan, he charted sixteen singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, all of which made the top 40. After leaving Mercury in 2003, he signed to [[Equity Music Group]] and charted three more singles. Two of these were later included on his sixth studio album, ''[[Familiar Stranger (Mark Wills album)|Familiar Stranger]]'', which was released on the Tenacity label in 2008.

Of his albums, ''Wish You Were Here'' is the best-selling, with a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. This album's [[Wish You Were Here (Mark Wills song)|title track]] and the late 2002-early 2003 release "[[19 Somethin']]" both reached No.&nbsp;1; on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Besides these, six more of his singles have reached top 10 on the chart: his debut single "[[Jacob's Ladder (Mark Wills song)|Jacob's Ladder]]", "[[Places I've Never Been]]", "[[I Do (Cherish You)]]", "[[Don't Laugh at Me]]", "[[She's in Love]]", and a [[cover version]] of [[Brian McKnight]]'s "[[Back at One (song)|Back at One]]". Two songs originally recorded by Wills, "[[Somebody (Mark Wills song)|Somebody]]" and "[[What Hurts the Most]]", were later hit singles for [[Reba McEntire]], [[Jo O'Meara]], [[Rascal Flatts]], and [[Cascada]] respectively.

On December 21, 2018, Wills was invited to become the 218th member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He was inducted on January 11, 2019.<ref name="nashville.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nashville.com/wills-invited-to-join-the-opry-capps-celebrates-60/|title=Wills Invited To Join The Opry, Capps Celebrates 60|date=December 23, 2018|website=Nashville.com|language=en-US|access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref>

==Early life==
Wills was born in Blue Ridge, Georgia.<ref name="allmusic"/>

== Career ==
In his teenaged years, Wills played in [[garage band]]s, taking inspiration from rock groups such as [[Bon Jovi]].<ref name="allmusic"/> During his young adulthood, however, he began to take an interest in country music. He entered a local talent contest in [[Marietta, Georgia]], at age 17, and after winning the contest, he began to perform locally.<ref name="allmusic"/> From there, he went to work as a demo singer in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], before doing the same in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. While in Nashville, he was discovered by record producers Carson Chamberlain and [[Keith Stegall]], who helped him sign to a recording contract with [[Mercury Records Nashville]].<ref name="allmusic"/>

Wills's [[Mark Wills (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1996 under the production of Chamberlain and Stegall. Its lead-off single, "[[Jacob's Ladder (Mark Wills song)|Jacob's Ladder]]", went to number six on the country charts. "High Low and in Between", the [[B-side]] to "Jacob's Ladder", was the next single, reaching number 33.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|pages=470–471|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Finishing off the single releases was the number-five "[[Places I've Never Been]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> Despite the success of its first and third singles, the album did not sell well,<ref name="allmusic"/> and it peaked at  number 38 on the country albums charts.<ref name="allmusic"/>

''[[Wish You Were Here (Mark Wills album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', Wills's second album, was his most commercially successful, earning a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The lead-off single "[[I Do (Cherish You)]]" and its follow-up, "[[Don't Laugh at Me]]", both reached number two on the country charts, with the former bringing him to the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for the first time.<ref name="whitburn"/> Following the pair of number two-peaking songs was the album's [[Wish You Were Here (Mark Wills song)|title track]]. Co-written by [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], [[Skip Ewing]], and Debbie Moore, it became Wills's first number-one country hit in 1999.<ref name="whitburn"/> Later that year, the boy band [[98 Degrees]] covered "I Do (Cherish You)" on their album ''[[98 Degrees and Rising]]''. Following "Wish You Were Here" was "[[She's in Love]]", the final single from ''Wish You Were Here'', which peaked at number seven. In 1998, Wills received an [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Top New Male Vocalist.

===2000–2003===
In 2000, he voiced the character of Huckleberry Finn in MGM's animated remake of ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'', Wills's only film role to date. Also for the film, Wills and [[Lee Ann Womack]], who plays the singing voice of Becky in the film,  sing the end title song "Never Ever and Forever" as a duet.

Wills's eighth chart entry was a cover of [[R&B]] singer [[Brian McKnight]]'s 1998 hit single "[[Back at One (song)|Back at One]]". This cover was a top-five country hit for Wills in early 2000 and the first single from his third album, ''[[Permanently]]''. This album was Wills's highest entry on the country albums charts, peaking at number three. Following "Back at One" was another R&B cover, this time of [[Brandy (entertainer)|Brandy]]'s 1999 single "[[Almost Doesn't Count]]". This cover reached the top 20, and was followed by "I Want to Know (Everything There Is to Know About You)", which reached  number 33. ''Permanently'' was certified gold by the RIAA. Unlike his previous albums, this album was produced entirely by Carson Chamberlain, as Stegall had left Mercury in 2000.

''[[Loving Every Minute (album)|Loving Every Minute]]'' was the title of Wills's fourth studio album and its lead-off single. This song, co-written by [[Michael White (singer)|Michael White]], only peaked at number 18, however, and the album's other single – the [[Jamie O'Neal]] duet "I'm Not Gonna Do Anything Without You", which was also on O'Neal's debut album ''[[Shiver (Jamie O'Neal album)|Shiver]]'' – reached number 31. Also included on this album was the song "[[Somebody (Reba McEntire song)|Somebody]]", which later became a number-one hit in 2004 when [[Reba McEntire]] recorded it for her 2003 album ''[[Room to Breathe (Reba McEntire album)|Room to Breathe]]''.

Wills's biggest chart hit, "[[19 Somethin']]", was released in late 2002. It topped the country charts in early 2003, and stayed at number one for six weeks. The song was also his highest Hot 100 entry, peaking at  number 23. This song was the first of two newly recorded songs on his 2003 [[Greatest Hits (Mark Wills album)|greatest hits]] album, which reprised all of his chart singles to that point except "High Low and in Between" and "I Want to Know (Everything There Is to Know About You)". The other new song on this album, "When You Think of Me", was a number-28 country hit in early 2003. Wills produced these two new tracks with [[Chris Lindsey]].

''[[And the Crowd Goes Wild]]'', his fifth studio album, came later in 2003. This was his first full studio album, which he co-produced, again doing so with Chris Lindsey. Although the album itself peaked at number five on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart, its two singles only made the middle and lower top-40 regions on the Hot Country Songs chart. Its [[Jeffrey Steele]]-penned [[country rock]] and [[country rap]]-generated title track was the lead-off single, reaching number 29 on the country charts. Following it was "That's a Woman", which stopped at number 40. Like his previous studio release, this album included a song that later became a number-one hit for another artist: "[[What Hurts the Most]]", which was a number-one country and adult contemporary hit for the group [[Rascal Flatts]] when they covered it on their 2006 album ''[[Me and My Gang]]''. This song was also a single for [[Jo O'Meara]] in 2005 and [[Cascada]] in 2007. Wills's own rendition was a minor hit on the Hot Digital Songs charts in 2006. Also included on ''And the Crowd Goes Wild'' was a cover of [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s hit "[[Prisoner of the Highway]]", recorded as a duet with Milsap.

===2006–present===
[[File:Mark Wills performing in Baghdad September 19, 2008.jpg|thumb|Mark Wills in 2008]]
Due to the poor performance of ''And the Crowd Goes Wild'', Wills left Mercury in 2004. In 2004, Wills also recorded a cover of [[Elvin Bishop]]'s "[[Fooled Around and Fell in Love]]" for the [[southern rock]] tribute album ''Southern Rock Country Style''. He did not record again until country singer [[Clint Black]] signed him to his [[Equity Music Group]] label in 2006. Wills's first release for the label was "Hank", which peaked at number 49 and was never included on an album. His first album for the label, titled ''[[Familiar Stranger (Mark Wills album)|Familiar Stranger]]'', was originally slated for release in September 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5627804,00.html |title=A Day of Thunder for Mark Wills |access-date=July 17, 2007 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195058/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5627804,00.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was repeatedly pushed back due to the poor chart performance of "Take It All Out on Me" and "Days of Thunder." Tenacity Records then acquired the album and released it in 2008, issuing "The Things We Forget" as its third single. After this song came "Entertaining Angels", co-written by [[Willie Mack (musician)|Willie Mack]].  In late 2009, he released then a fifth single, "Crazy White Boy", written by Brett James and Blair Daly. Wills released the compilation album ''2nd Time Around'' in July 2009, which comprises re-recordings of several Mercury singles.

Wills released a new single in January 2011 called "Looking for America", written by Bernie Nelson, Philip Douglas, and Jeremy Bussey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lookingforamerica.us/node/8 |title=Mark Wills Releases New Song, "Looking For America" |access-date=December 11, 2010 |work=Looking For America |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112021713/http://lookingforamerica.us/node/8 |archive-date=November 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It served as the title track to his 2011 album of the same name, released June 21, 2011, from Big Red Records and Tenacity Records.

He was invited by [[Vince Gill]] to become the 218th member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on December 21, 2018, and was inducted on January 11, 2019<ref name="nashville.com"/>
