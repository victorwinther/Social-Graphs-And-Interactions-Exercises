==Biography==
Born in [[Swainsboro, Georgia|Swainsboro]], Georgia, Wilson picked up the guitar and taught himself how to play.  In 1975, he released his debut album ''New Beginnings''. Three more albums on the [[Monument Records|Monument]] [[record label]] imprint of [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] followed, ''Let Me Sing My Song to You'' (1976), ''Loose Change'' (1977), and ''The Sojourner'' (1979).

Despite Wilson's accolades and fans, no [[hit record]] emerged. Wilson left the [[music industry]] in 1980. He returned in the late 1980s when other songwriters encouraged him to attend the Frank Brown International Songwriter's Festival in [[Perdido Key, Florida]]. He began touring again in 1989, and by 2003 still accepted occasional engagements. Wilson remained devoted to his music, rather than to the marketplace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/larry-jon-wilson-1940-2010|title=Larry Jon Wilson (1940-2010)|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}</ref>

Wilson appears in the documentary film ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'' recorded 1975–1976, where he is filmed recording the song "Ohoopee River Bottomland".

In 2008, [[Sony BMG]] released a new Wilson album, after a thirty-year hiatus from recording. In 2009, [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] re-released the album in the US.

Wilson died following a stroke in June 2010, at the age of 69.<ref name="Dead"/>
