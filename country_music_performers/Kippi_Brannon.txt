She made her debut on the country music scene as a teenager, releasing four singles on [[MCA Records]] in the early 1980s before leaving her career in favor of a college education.

==Early life==
Kippi Rolynn Binkley was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="oldies"/> A singer and musician at an early age, she began singing professionally before she was a teenager. At age 12, she gave a performance at a local shopping mall, when an executive for [[MCA Records]] discovered her.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="coast"/> With the help of record producer Chuck Howard, Jr., Kippi was signed to MCA in 1981. Her surname was altered to Brannon, after Brannon Auto Parts, a local automotive parts store.<ref name="oldies"/><ref name="allmusic"/>

==Career==
Brannon charted three singles in the early 1980s, in addition to receiving a New Female Vocalist of the Year nomination from the [[Academy of Country Music]].<ref name="allmusic"/> She was also signed as an opening act for other country artists. Although she was gaining in popularity, Brannon decided to leave her career and attend college, first at [[Belmont University]] and later at the [[University of Tennessee]]-Knoxville.<ref name="oldies"/> During her hiatus from the country music scene, she also married and had a daughter, Kasey;<ref name="coast">{{cite web |url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/05-97/05-28-97/c04ae214.htm |title=Still "Daddy's Little Girl": Former teen star Kippi Brannon returns to country music |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Patterson |first=Jim |date=1997-05-28 |work=South Coast Today}}</ref> she later divorced and married a second time.<ref name="allmusic"/>

By 1988, Brannon resumed her music career, signing to [[Curb Records]] this time around. Her first single for the label, "I Ain't Never", failed to make the charts upon its 1992 release. Working with producers [[Matt Rollings]] and [[James Stroud]], she began a search for additional songs to record; however, by the end of 1992, she once again had to take a hiatus, as she had divorced a second time, and had to care for her ailing father.<ref name="allmusic"/> 

Her first album, ''I'd Be with You'', was released in early 1997, under the production of [[Mark Bright (record producer)|Mark Bright]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Though the album's first single, "Daddy's Little Girl", only reached number 42 on Billboard's [[Hot Country Songs]] chart -- which tracked only radio airplay at the time -- it was a retail success, spending 23 weeks and reaching number 6 on the Country Single Sales chart, and number 23 on the 1997 year-end Country Single Sales chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Billboard-1997-12-27 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-12-27.pdf |website=World Radio History}}</ref> The song was also blended with fellow [[Curb Records]] artist [[Jeff Carson]]'s solo recording of [[Bob Carlisle]]'s similarly-themed hit single "[[Butterfly Kisses (song)|Butterfly Kisses]]" as an additional track on Carson's [[Butterfly Kisses (Jeff Carson album)|album of the same name]]. Like Brannon's single, Carson's version of "Butterfly Kisses" struggled on the airplay charts but was a sales success, spending 15 weeks on the Country Single Sales chart and peaking at number 6. ''I'd Be with You'' reached number 53 on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart.

Brannon has not recorded since.
