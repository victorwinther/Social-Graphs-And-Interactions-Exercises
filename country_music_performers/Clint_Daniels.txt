==Biography==
Clint Daniels was born August 24, 1974, in [[Panama City, Florida]], but raised in the Panama City suburb of [[Lynn Haven, Florida|Lynn Haven]]. Daniels first gained an interest in music as a child, singing with his sister in church.<ref name="allmusic"/> Inspired by [[bluegrass music]], Daniels taught himself to play guitar at age twelve. After graduating high school, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in pursuit of a career in country music. By 1998, he was discovered by an [[A&R]] staff member from the [[Arista Nashville]] label, and was signed to the label that year.<ref name="allmusic"/>

He charted two singles, "A Fool's Progress" and "When I Grow Up," which respectively reached No.&nbsp;44 and No.&nbsp;53 on the country singles charts. Both were to have been included on a self-titled debut album, which was ultimately not released due to Arista's restructuring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundspike.com/story2/1272/arista-nashville-consolidation-leaves-several-acts-without-a-label/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411202601/http://www.soundspike.com/story2/1272/arista-nashville-consolidation-leaves-several-acts-without-a-label/|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 11, 2013|title=Arista Nashville Consolidation Leaves Several Acts Without A Label|last=Evans|first=Rob|date=June 5, 2000|work=Soundspike|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref> Daniels moved to [[Epic Records]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4647446-1.html |title=Countrycool, Songs.com Call It Quits; Ccma Moves Music Week To Calgary |accessdate=May 24, 2008 |last=Stark |first=Phyllis |date=January 20, 2001 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Although he released a third single, the No.&nbsp;56 "The Letter (Almost Home)," he never released an album for Epic and has not recorded since.
