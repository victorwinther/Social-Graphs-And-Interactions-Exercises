==Biography==
Sheila Marlene Alldredge was born in [[Athens, Alabama]], in 1953 to James and Willie Alldredge. She had two brothers named Frank and Michael.<ref name="Frank">{{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ohio/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=155764974#fbLoggedOut|title=James F. "Frank" Alldredge Obituary |access-date=5 February 2013 |work=Akron Beacon Journal}}</ref> Andrews' father traveled to Ohio from Alabama to work in rubber plants and was a truck driver when he worked in Alabama. Eventually the family moved to [[Akron, Ohio]], permanently. When Andrews was 16 she got married. The couple had four children and later divorced.

While living in Ohio, Andrews got a job selling carpeting over the phone for CarpetTown. She began singing in a nightclub when she was 23. Her second husband "discovered" her and urged her to move to Nashville and meet producer Brien Fisher of [[Ovation Records]] and begin a recording career.<ref name="Carpets">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GSEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7SoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6942,2584403&dq=sheila-andrews+akron&hl=en |title=That's a Special Voice Selling Carpets |access-date=15 January 2012 |work=The Milwaukee Journal}}</ref>

==Career==
Andrews sang in a soulful type voice; she told the [[Milwaukee Journal]] after moving to Nashville, "When I first came down here from Akron and met different people who listened to my tape they all said, 'You sound so different'. Later on they said it was good, but at the time it made me feel really bad". One of the reasons for Andrews' unique voice was a result of surgery that removed a tumor from her thyroid.<ref name="Carpets"/> Andrews revealed that after the surgery, "They didn't tell me I wasn't supposed to sing or talk loud for a year. I started singing after the operation and it lowered on me. It used to be three or four octaves higher. Now when I talk everyone thinks I have a cold."<ref name="Carpets"/>

Andrews also said during another interview, that after the surgery, "I started singing in a nightclub shortly after the operation and that's when my voice began to lower and lower on me. I should have been furious with that careless doctor but how can I when he is a lot responsible for the upturn of my career!"<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan ''Boca Raton News'' [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lC1UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nIwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6621,4617390&dq=sheila-andrews+akron&hl=en Bad Medical Advice Made Sheila Andrews and Unusual Singer] (January 27, 1980)</ref>

===1978 ''Love Me Like a Woman'' ===
In 1978, Andrews signed with the Ovation Records label. The same year Andrews released her debut album, ''Love Me Like a Woman'', under Fisher's production. The album's first single was the [[Layng Martine, Jr.]] penned "Too Fast for Rapid City" which reached No. 88 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Its follow-up and title track "Love Me like a Woman" failed to chart. The album's third and final single "I Gotta Get Back the Feeling" also peaked at No. 88.

In a review printed in [[The Ottawa Citizen]], the author gave the album a mixed review by writing, "Andrews demonstrates a lot of potential on this album, but she has to quit being so self-conscious of her husky, wispy, voice and allow it to express more natural feelings."<ref>''The Ottawa Citizen'' [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OaMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zu4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1037,245657&dq=sheila-andrews+country&hl=en Recent Recordings and Notes of Interest] (September 1, 1979)</ref>

===1979–1981: ''What I Had With You'' and ''Lovesick''===
Between Andrews' first two albums, Ovation released "[[What I Had With You]]" as a single with fellow label mate [[Joe Sun]]. "What I Had With You" was more successful on the ''Billboard'' charts than her first three singles, reaching a peak of No. 48 on the Country Singles chart. The song would later go on to be a top twenty hit when [[John Conlee]] recorded the song two years later.

In 1979, Ovation released a sampler LP album featuring artists on the label including Andrews.<ref>''Billboard'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSUEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22SHEILA+ANDREWS%22&pg=PT32 Ovation To Plug 10 LP Summerfest] (Jun 23, 1979)</ref>

The same year, Andrews signed with [[Jim Halsey]]'s Thunderbird Artists booking agency.<ref>''Billboard'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=CyUEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22SHEILA+ANDREWS%22&pg=PT37 Country] (Nov 17, 1979)</ref> Later in the year Andrews appeared on the German TV series Rock Pop and performed "Diggin' and a Grindin' for His Love" which she had recorded on her debut album.<ref>''Rock Pop'' {{YouTube|id=Z6d0Gem—b8&list=UUm94pZIjuUxrC1IvbAcEDrQ&index=3|title=Sheila Andrews – Diggin' and a Grindin' for His Love 1979}} (October 13, 1979)</ref> Andrews also appeared on [[Pop! Goes the Country]] during the 1980–1981 season. She sang "A Little Thing Like Love" and also sang a medley of "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]" and "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]" with host [[Tom T. Hall]].<ref>''The Classic TV Archive'' [http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/PopGoesTheCountry_07_(1980-81).htm Pop! Goes the Country" Season 7 (1980–81)]</ref>

On September 22, 1980, Andrews released her second album, ''Lovesick''. [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] gave the album a positive review and wrote, "Snappy production enhances the glittering array of love ballads."<ref>''Billboard'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=BiQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22sheila+andrews%22&pg=PT87 Top Album Picks] (October 18, 1980)</ref><ref name="bboardreview">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/80s/1980/BB-1980-10-18.pdf|title=Review: Sheila Andrews – Love Sick|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=18 October 1980|access-date=30 May 2020|volume=85|number=42|page=66|via=American Radio History|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>
The album's first single "It Don't Get Better Than This" would go on to be the highest charting single of her career when it reached a peak of 42. Billboard listed "It Don't Get Better Than This" as a Top Single Pick.<ref>''Billboard'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=9iQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Sheila+Andrews%22&pg=PT66 Top Single Picks] (July 5, 1980)</ref> The album's second single, "Where Could You Take Me," debuted at number 80 in the November 29th issue of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], but would only peak at number 58.<ref>''Billboard'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=biQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Sheila+Andrews%22&pg=PT52 Hot Country Singles] (November 29, 1980)</ref>

In May 1981 Andrews appeared on [[That Nashville Music]] which also featured [[Vern Gosdin]] who had just joined Ovation Records.<ref>''TVGuide.com'' [http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=441933&more=ucepisodelist&episodeid=761036 That Nashville Music Episodes]</ref><ref>''The Argus-Press'' [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=19810507&id=n3kiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=La0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1184,806072 TV Programs] (May 7, 1981)</ref>

Andrews' final single, "Maybe I Should Have Been Listening", failed to chart, but would later become a top forty hit for [[Gene Watson]]. In 1981 Ovation went out of business leaving Andrews without a recording contract.

===1982: ''Crystal Tears''===
In 1982, Andrews signed with the small label [[Brylen Records|Brylen]] where she made one album, ''Crystal Tears'', but no singles were released from it.
