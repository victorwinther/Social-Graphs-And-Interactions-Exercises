'''John Wesley Ryles''' (born December 2, 1950) is an American [[country music]] artist. Ryles recorded a string of hit country songs, beginning in 1968 when he was still a teenager, and continuing through the 1980s. He no longer records as a headline artist but remains active in the music industry as a [[session musician]].

==Biography==
At age 17, he made his debut in 1968 with the single "[[Kay (song)|Kay]]", a Top Ten hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, and the title track to his debut album for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=367|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>

Ryles later recorded one album, ''Reconsider Me'', for the Plantation label, which produced a No.&nbsp;39 single in its title track. It was followed by two non-album singles, "Tell It Like It Is" and "When a Man Loves a Woman," both on the Music Mill label in 1976.<ref name="whitburn"/>

He then moved to [[Dot Records]]. His first single on ABC/Dot, "Fool", Made it to No. 18 on the Hot Country chart followed by his highest-peaking single, the No. 5 "Once in a Lifetime Thing."<ref name="allmusic"/> When that label merged with [[MCA Records]], he issued the album ''Let the Night Begin'' there. The first single, "Liberated Woman" climbed to No. 14 on the Billboard Hot Country chart. It was followed by a rendition of "[[Always on My Mind]], which went to #20 on the Billboard Hot Country chart.."<ref name="whitburn"/> The last song released from this album, "Perfect Strangers", reached No. 24 on the Billboard chart.

Two more singles followed on the Primero label: "We've Got to Start Meeting Like This" and "Just Once," followed by "She Took It Too Well" on [[16th Avenue Records]] in 1984.<ref name="whitburn"/> The last label for which he recorded was [[Warner Bros. Records]] between 1987 and 1988. Although he reached Top 20 with "Louisiana Rain" during his stay on Warner, he did not release an album for the label.<ref name="whitburn"/>

Since the release of his last single in 1988, Ryles has served primarily as a background vocalist. Ryles is married to [[Joni Lee]], the daughter of country singer [[Conway Twitty]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.countrythangdaily.com/meet-conway-twitty-children-who-keep-his-memories-alive/|title=Meet Conway Twitty's Children Who Keep His Memories Alive|date=May 26, 2020 |access-date=January 11, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7980767/conway-twitty-timeless-joni-daughter|title=Conway Twitty's Posthumous 'Timeless': His Daughter Shares the Story Behind Undiscovered Material|magazine=Billboard|access-date=January 11, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/joni-twitty-interview-conway-twitty-timeless-album/|title=Interview: Conway Twitty's Daughter Joni Talks Re-discovering Dad's Music|website=The Boot|date=December 6, 2017 |access-date=January 11, 2021}}</ref>
