The Story Behind His Journey to Music|work=Country Swag|date=April 5, 2023}}</ref> is an American [[country music]] singer. He made his debut in 2022 with the single "How It Oughta Be".

==Biography==
Shane Profitt was born in [[Columbia, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shane-profitt-mn0004225422/biography | title=Shane Profitt biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=January 9, 2022 | author=James Christopher Monger}}</ref>

Profitt began playing guitar in 2018 when his grandfather gave him one for Christmas. After this, he began learning to perform [[cover song]]s at local venues in addition to writing his own material. After encountering a woman at a guitar store, he took her on a date to a [[sushi]] restaurant where he met country music singer [[Chris Janson]] and his wife, Kelly, who is also his manager. The Jansons signed Profitt to a songwriting contract, which led to Janson recording two of his songs on his 2021 album ''All In''. He also selected Profitt as an opening act on his Halfway to Crazy tour.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://countrynow.com/country-next-shane-profitt/ | title=Country Next: Shane Profitt | publisher=Country Now | date=October 25, 2022 | accessdate=January 9, 2023 | author=Melissa Lorge}}</ref>

This led to Profitt signing with [[Big Machine Records]] along with Janson's imprint label, Harpeth 60 Records, in 2022. The label released his debut [[extended play]] ''Maury County Line'' that August, along with lead single "How It Oughta Be".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://entertainment-focus.com/2022/08/08/shane-profitt-explodes-out-of-the-blocks-with-new-ep-the-anthem-how-it-oughta-be/ | title=Shane Profitt Explodes Out Of The Blocks With New EP & The Anthem 'How It Oughta Be' | website=Entertainment Focus | date=August 8, 2022 | accessdate=January 9, 2023 | author=James Daykin}}</ref> In February 2023, "How It Oughta Be" reached number 16 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Country Airplay]].<ref name="bcu">{{cite magazine | url=https://bulletins.billboard.com/country/country_update_2023_0421.pdf | title=Billboard Country Update | magazine=Billboard | date=April 21, 2023 | access-date=April 23, 2023}}</ref>
