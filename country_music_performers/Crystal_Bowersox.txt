==''American Idol''==
Bowersox auditioned for ''American Idol'' in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She sang "[[Piece of My Heart]]". Guest judge [[Shania Twain]] commented that she had a "raw, natural talent."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/Bowersox+Idol+idolize/3056262/story.html |title= Bowersox an Idol to idolize |author= Alex Strachan |publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date= May 21, 2010 |access-date= July 30, 2010}}</ref>

On March 2, 2010, Bowersox was hospitalized due to [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) from [[type 1 diabetes]], forcing a last minute switch in scheduling to give her extra time to recuperate. Bowersox confirmed the illness on the May 19, 2010 results show during an interview with host [[Ryan Seacrest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cnmnewsnetwork.com/11618/crystal-bowersox-hospital-2010-american-idol-contestant-hospitalized-for-diabetes/ |title=Crystal Bowersox Hospital: 2010 American Idol Contestant Hospitalized for Diabetes? |author=Bella Horton |publisher=CNN |date=March 3, 2010 |access-date=March 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306130832/http://cnmnewsnetwork.com/11618/crystal-bowersox-hospital-2010-american-idol-contestant-hospitalized-for-diabetes/ |archive-date=March 6, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959174/crystal-bowersoxs-american-idol-future-uncertain |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'American Idol' Future Uncertain |agency=Associated Press |date=March 3, 2010 |access-date=March 25, 2010}}</ref> The men competed that day instead of the women.

The following week, her strong performance prompted [[Simon Cowell]] to state, "Right now, you are the one everyone has to beat."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633573/20100309/story.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312132906/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633573/20100309/story.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 12, 2010 |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'Give Me One Reason' Dominates 'American Idol' |author=James Montgomery |publisher=MTV |date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=March 25, 2010}}</ref>

After [[Siobhan Magnus]]'s elimination from the top 6 of ''[[American Idol]]'', Bowersox became the last remaining female contestant in the competition.

Bowersox was the first female contestant to make it to the finale since [[Jordin Sparks]] won the title in 2007. She is also the first contestant in ''American Idol'' history to have one of their original songs played on the show, or at least during their hometown package.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slezak |first=Michael |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/05/22/american-idol-crystal-bowersox-lee-dewyze/ |title='Idolatry': Breaking down the Crystal-Lee finale (and bidding adieu to Casey) on 'American Idol' |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 22, 2010 |access-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref> Crystal's original song "Holy Toledo" was played on the May 19 Top 3 Results show as the background music for her homecoming package - when she returned to Toledo, Ohio and Elliston, Ohio the previous weekend - and segued into her live performance of the same song at "Bowerstock".

During her time on ''Idol'', Bowersox dated Tony Kusian, but the couple broke up just hours before the ''Idol'' finale.<ref>{{cite news | title = Crystal Bowersox and Boyfriend Split Before Idol Finale | publisher = People | date = May 27, 2010 | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20420919,00.html | access-date = September 25, 2010 | archive-date = September 28, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100928121354/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20420919,00.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>

On the final performance day, in [[Simon Cowell]]'s final critique on ''American Idol'', he called her performance of "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]" "outstanding" and "by far, the best performance and song of the night".

On May 26, 2010, Bowersox was named runner-up to winner [[Lee DeWyze]]. She announced that after her ''Idol'' career, she wants to bring more awareness to type 1 diabetes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2010/05/crystal-bowersox-and-lee-dewyze-dish-on-judges-picks-why-viewers-should-vote-for-them/1/ |title=Crystal Bowersox and Lee DeWyze dish on judges' picks, why viewers should vote for them|date=May 20, 2010|work=USA Today|access-date=May 30, 2010}}</ref>

Bowersox is the third ''Idol'' Runner-Up (preceded by [[Clay Aiken]] and [[David Archuleta]]) to never be in the Bottom 3 or Bottom 2.
