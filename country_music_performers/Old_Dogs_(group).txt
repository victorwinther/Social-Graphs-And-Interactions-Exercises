The album's content was written primarily by author, poet, and songwriter [[Shel Silverstein]]. Most of the group's songs were based on the realization of [[aging]], after Bare told Silverstein that there were "no good songs about growing old."<ref name="allmusic"/> The album was recorded live in studio, so audience applause can be heard between the tracks. The two discs come in different cases, and has different album art for them. The album was also issued as a single disc. "Still Gonna Die" was released as a single from the project.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 17, 1999|title=Singles|magazine=Billboard|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg0EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22old+dogs%22+%22still+gonna+die%22&pg=PA16}}</ref> The album was one of the last projects Silverstein completed in his lifetime; he died in May 1999, five months after the album was released.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/11/books/shel-silverstein-zany-writer-and-cartoonist-dies-at-67.html |title=Shel Silverstein, Zany Writer and Cartoonist, Dies at 67 |quote=Shel Silverstein, whose goofy, gross and macabre yet always enchanting poetry for children sold more than 14&nbsp;million books, was found dead yesterday morning at his home in Key West, Florida.
