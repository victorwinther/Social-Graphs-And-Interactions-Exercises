==Biography==
Chalee Tennison was born in Texas and was influenced musically by her brother's collection of 8-track tapes, which included artists such as [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Tanya Tucker]]. She sang in church choir with her mother and sister, but did not begin singing professionally until she was 16. She then started a band with her third husband, which performed in [[Gatesville, Texas]]. To support herself at the time, she also worked a variety of jobs, including waitress, substitute teacher, and prison security guard.<ref name="radio">{{cite journal|date=May 14, 1999|title=New artist fact file: Chalee Tennison|journal=Radio & Records|page=68|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-05-14.pdf}}</ref>

She moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and worked as a demo singer.
