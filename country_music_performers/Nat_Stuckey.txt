In 1965, Stuckey co-wrote [[Buck Owens]]' number-one single "[[Waitin' in Your Welfare Line]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He then wrote and recorded "[[Sweet Thang]]" on Paula Records.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Another of Stuckey's compositions, "[[Pop a Top]]", was recorded by [[Jim Ed Brown]] on RCA Records in 1967 and by [[Alan Jackson]] in 1999.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> A year later, Stuckey signed with RCA himself.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Among his hits for RCA were "Plastic Saddle" and "Sweet Thing and Cisco".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Stuckey teamed with [[Connie Smith]] on the duet of "Young Love", followed by another single and two albums.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The duo was in the final nominations for a Grammy for their version of "Whispering Hope".

After seven years with RCA, Stuckey signed with MCA Records.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> With [[Conway Twitty]] and David Barnes producing, his single "Sun Comin' Up" made the top 20, but none of his other MCA releases did. He last charted in 1978 with the number 26 single "[[The Days of Sand and Shovels]]".<ref name="whitburn"/>

Stuckey also went on to direct in producing sessions, along with announcing and singing jingles on hundreds of regional and national commercials. He wrote two jingles for [[Coca-Cola]] in the 1970s, recorded twenty-two spots of [[McDonald's]], and was the singing voice on the last [[Spuds MacKenzie]] commercial for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]]. He continued recording jingles into the 1980s.<ref name="whitburn"/>

Another project was the ownership of Music Row Talent, Inc., a booking agency in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, which was in business for twelve years. Through his Texas Promise Land Development Company, Stuckey began acquiring land in both Tennessee and Texas.

Shortly before Stuckey's death, [[Randy Travis]] released "[[Diggin' Up Bones]]", which Stuckey co-wrote.

On August 24, 1988, Stuckey died of lung cancer in a Nashville, Tennessee hospital.<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=400/1}}</ref>
