MacGregor was born May 6, 1948, in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]], United States.<ref name="AllMusic"/> She began studying piano at age six, and was singing with bands by the time she was a teenager. After graduating from [[Saint Joseph's Academy (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Saint Joseph's Academy]] in 1966, she briefly attended the [[University of Minnesota]], and later began to tour the country with various acts and, in the process, catching the attention of [[Peter Yarrow]] from [[Peter, Paul & Mary]]. She soon joined Yarrow, singing [[backing singer|backup]] on a solo tour, and made an appearance on his ''Love Songs'' album.<ref name="ppm goldmine">{{cite journal|title=Peter, Paul and Mary - A Song To Sing All Over This Land|journal=Goldmine|date=1996-04-12|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|url=http://www.peterpaulandmary.com/history/f-ruhlmann4.htm|access-date=January 6, 2017|quote=Next, he began looking for a deal for one of his backup singers, Mary MacGregor, who had sung on ''Love Songs''.}}</ref>

Signed to [[Ariola|Ariola Records America]], MacGregor released her debut single, "[[Torn Between Two Lovers (song)|Torn Between Two Lovers]]", in late 1976; it became a smash hit by February 1977. The new year saw the single top both the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/1977.html|title=Seventies Almanac – 1977|publisher=Superseventies.com|access-date=December 16, 2012}}</ref> and [[adult contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary]] charts and was certified as a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]].<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=torn+between+two+lovers#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=Recording Industry Association of America|publisher=RIAA|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> In addition, it reached #3 on ''Billboard'''s Country chart and also reached No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=339}}</ref> Two further singles from the album of the same name, also written and produced by Yarrow, charted but were overwhelmed by the success of the title track.

MacGregor admitted in ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits'' by [[Fred Bronson]] that she hated her own chart-topper, chiefly because she had little sympathy for the narrator of "Torn Between Two Lovers", a woman who confesses to her husband that she is having an affair, but pleads with her husband to stay with her and accept the situation.<ref name=Lambert>{{cite web|url=https://www.countrythangdaily.com/torn-two-lovers-macgregor/|website=CountryThangDaily.com|author=Lambert, Arden|title=Of Love Dilemma, Are You "Torn Between Two Lovers"?|date=February 26, 2018|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref> MacGregor also said that the song indirectly led to the breakup of her own marriage, because her career kept her away from home so often that her relationship with her husband strained, and they decided to separate.<ref name=Lambert /> She did acknowledge that the song was successful because it appealed to listeners who had found themselves in the situation described in the lyrics.<ref name="billboard number one">{{cite book |last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|author-link=Fred Bronson|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|publisher=Billboard Books|year=2003|page=453|isbn=9780823076772}}</ref><ref name=Lambert />

She released several more albums, and had three more minor chart singles (including the song "Good Friend" from the 1979 [[Bill Murray]] film ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Meatballs-David-Naughton/dp/B000O4L77W|title=Meatballs: Music|website=Amazon |date=April 7, 2009|access-date=December 16, 2012}}</ref> "Good Friend" was later added to her third and eponymous final album.

In 1980, MacGregor won best song and best performance at the [[World Popular Song Festival]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]] with "What's the Use" which she had co-written with David Bluefield.

For the 1981 Japanese [[anime]] film ''[[Adieu Galaxy Express 999]]'', MacGregor wrote and performed two songs. They were "Sayonara" and "Love Light".

In 1983, [[Mike Love]] (of [[The Beach Boys]]) and MacGregor performed "[[Do You Hear What I Hear?|Do You Hear What I Hear]]" from ''Scrooge's Rock N Roll Christmas''.

In the mid-1980s, MacGregor performed in nightclubs around the Central Coast of California with Mary and the Blue Jays, a trio composed of MacGregor, James Royce on bass, and [[James Kennedy (social psychologist)|Jim Kennedy]] on guitar.

In 1999, she teamed up with fellow musician friends, Joe Ghiglia and John Holt, to form The Mary MacGregor Band. The result was an album called ''Perfect Yellow House''.

She is also mentioned in the liner notes of 1976's ''The Steamboat Album'' as doing vocals for one of the tracks, "Rabbit Ears". The album was recorded by Yampa River Records in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado]].

She now lives in California, has remarried, has two children and is retired.
