== Biography ==
Drake Milligan was born in [[Arlington, Texas]], on June 1, 1998, to James & Angela Milligan. He was inspired by the country music his father listened to, particularly [[Merle Haggard]], as well as an [[Elvis impersonator]] he saw sing at a nearby restaurant. After performing locally as an Elvis impersonator himself, Milligan answered a [[casting call]] by [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] for the role of [[Elvis Presley]] in their TV series ''[[Sun Records (TV series)|Sun Records]]'' (2017). He ended up landing the part, which required him to move from Texas to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], during his senior year of high school.<ref name="former star">{{cite web | url=https://www.fwweekly.com/2021/07/28/drake-milligan/ | title=Drake Milligan: The former star of CMT's Sun Records TV show launches his country career with his debut EP.
