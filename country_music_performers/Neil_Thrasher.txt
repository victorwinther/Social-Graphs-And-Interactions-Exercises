== Biography ==
Neil Thrasher was born in 1965 in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama. His father was a member of a gospel music band known as the Thrasher Brothers.<ref name="gac" /> The Thrasher Brothers were inducted into the Alabama music Hall of fame in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamhof.org/thrasherbrothers|title = Biography}}</ref>

Although he had originally planned to play college football, he later switched his focus to singing and songwriting.<ref name="gac">{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_cma_close_up/article/0,,GAC_26068_5147071,00.html |title=News: CMA Close UP : Neil Thrasher's Continuing Education |access-date=December 7, 2007 |last=Doerschuk |first=Robert L. |date=November 1, 2006|work=[[Great American Country|GAC.com]]}}</ref> In 1992 he met his future wife, Lana, who was running Major Bob Music publishing company that also managed [[Garth Brooks]]. Thrasher sang backing vocals on Brooks' 1990 album ''[[No Fences]]'' and wrote a single for [[Ricky Lynn Gregg]] in 1994. Eventually, the company's owner, Bob Doyle, introduced Thrasher to another singer-songwriter named Kelly Shiver. The two soon formed the duo [[Thrasher Shiver]], which released one album in 1996 on [[Asylum Records]]. In addition, Thrasher co-wrote [[Diamond Rio]]'s 1996 single "That's What I Get for Lovin' You" and [[Rhett Akins]]' 1997 single "Better Than It Used to Be".

Although Thrasher Shiver split up in 1997, both members continued to write songs, with Thrasher being the more prolific of the two. In 1999, [[Reba McEntire]] released "What Do You Say", one of Thrasher's compositions. The song reached Top 5 on the ''Billboard'' country music charts. Thrasher had minor success as a songwriter throughout the early 2000s, including low-charting singles for [[3 of Hearts (band)|3 of Hearts]] and [[Meredith Edwards (singer)|Meredith Edwards]], as well as [[Kenny Chesney]]'s "[[I Lost It]]" and [[Jeff Carson]]'s "[[Real Life (I Never Was the Same Again)]]."<ref name="bob" />

Thrasher became more prolific in the mid-2000s, with [[Rascal Flatts]] releasing four of his songs as singles, including the Number One hits "[[Fast Cars and Freedom]]" and "[[Take Me There (Rascal Flatts song)|Take Me There]]". The latter was co-written by Chesney, who also topped the country charts in late 2003-early 2004 with "[[There Goes My Life]]", another Thrasher co-write.<ref name="gac" /><ref name="bob">{{cite web |url=http://www.majorbob.com/writers/current/thrasher.htm |title=Major Bob Music > Catalog Writers : Neil Thrasher |access-date=December 7, 2007 |work=MajorBob.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126080740/http://www.majorbob.com/writers/current/thrasher.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = November 26, 2007}}</ref>
