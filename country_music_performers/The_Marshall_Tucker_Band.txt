'''The Marshall Tucker Band''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. Noted for incorporating [[blues]], [[country music|country]] and [[jazz]] into an eclectic sound, the Marshall Tucker Band helped establish the [[Southern rock]] genre in the early 1970s.<ref name=larkin /> While the band had reached the height of its commercial success by the end of the decade, it has recorded and performed continuously under various line-ups for 50 years.<ref name=larkin>Colin Larkin (ed.), "Marshall Tucker Band". ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Vol. 5 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 521–522.</ref> Lead vocalist [[Doug Gray]] remains the only original member still active with the band.

The original line-up of the Marshall Tucker Band, formed in 1972, included [[lead guitarist]], vocalist and primary songwriter [[Toy Caldwell]] (1947–1993), lead vocalist [[Doug Gray]] (born 1948), keyboard player, saxophone player and [[flautist]] [[Jerry Eubanks]] (born 1950), rhythm guitarist [[George McCorkle]] (1946–2007), drummer Paul Riddle (born 1953) and bassist [[Tommy Caldwell (musician)|Tommy Caldwell]] (1949–1980).

==Origin of the name==
The "Marshall Tucker" in the band's name does not refer to a band member, rather to a blind piano tuner from Spartanburg.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blind piano tuner turns talent into a key business|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19830215&id=8dZOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6972,3967212&hl=en|access-date = 2016-01-13|date = February 15, 1983|publisher = Associated Press|last = Herring|first = Melissa}}</ref>  While the band was discussing possible band names one evening in an old warehouse they had rented for rehearsal space, someone noticed that the warehouse's door key had the name "Marshall Tucker" inscribed on it, and suggested they call themselves "The Marshall Tucker Band," not realizing it referred to an actual person. Later it came to light that Marshall Tucker, the piano tuner, had tuned a piano in that rented space before the band and his name was inscribed on the key.<ref name=bio>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090529001722/http://marshalltucker.com/nt-31-biography.html The Marshall Tucker Band – Biography]. 2009.

==History==
===Early history===
The original members (and some later members) of the Marshall Tucker Band had been playing in various line-ups under different band names around the Spartanburg area since the early 1960s. In 1966 members of several such bands merged to form the Toy Factory, named after guitarist Toy Caldwell. The Toy Factory's constantly shifting line-up included, at various times, Caldwell, his younger brother Tommy, Doug Gray, Jerry Eubanks, George McCorkle and Franklin Wilkie. In the late 1960s, four of the band members served in the US military;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgemccorkle.com/Bio.htm|title=GEORGE MCCORKLE|publisher=georgemccorkle.com|access-date=3 June 2012|archive-date=14 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814042449/http://www.georgemccorkle.com/Bio.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|title=Marshall Tucker Band to Entertain Troops in Iraq & Kuwait|author=Ryan|date=May 4, 2011|publisher=marshalltucker.com|access-date=3 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611130837/http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|archive-date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|title=Marines salute Hutchings, Caldwells|author=Dudley Brown|date=June 29, 2003|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|access-date=3 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611130837/http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|archive-date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Toy Caldwell served in the Marine Corps and received a Purple Heart after being wounded in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/arts/toy-caldwell-jr-45-a-founder-of-the-marshall-tucker-band.html|title=Toy Caldwell Jr., 45, a Founder of the Marshall Tucker Band|date=February 26, 1993|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref>

By the 1970s, Toy Caldwell and George McCorkle had returned to Spartanburg and the Toy Factory had resumed playing in area clubs.<ref name=smith>Michael B. Smith, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/toy_bio.htm Toy Caldwell's Carolina Dreams]. Tuckerhead.com.  Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref>

In 1972 Caldwell and McCorkle once again revamped the band's line-up, eventually settling on Tommy Caldwell on bass, George McCorkle rhythm guitar, vocalist Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks, keyboards/flute/tenor sax, while adding Paul Riddle on drums; the new line-up adopted the name "Marshall Tucker Band". [[Wet Willie]] lead singer [[Jimmy Hall]] told Toy Caldwell to book the band at Grant's Lounge in [[Macon, Georgia]], which he did. After hearing the band play at Grant's Lounge, Buddy Thornton and [[Paul Hornsby]] recorded the band's [[demo (music)|demo]] at [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn Studios]]. [[Frank Fenter]] and [[Phil Walden]] signed the Marshall Tucker Band to [[Capricorn Records]] based on those demos.

===1970s===
The Marshall Tucker Band's [[The Marshall Tucker Band (album)|self-titled debut]], produced by [[Paul Hornsby]], was released in 1973 and certified gold in 1975.<ref name=elliott>James Elliott, "Marshall Tucker Band." ''Definitive Country: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Country Music and its Performers'' (New York: Berkley Publishing Group, 1995), pp. 504-505.</ref> All of the tracks were written by Toy Caldwell, including "[[Can't You See (The Marshall Tucker Band song)|Can't You See]]" which was released as a popular single in 1973 and re-released in 1977, generating much FM airplay and becoming the group's best known song. After the album's release, the band began touring, playing upwards of 300 shows per year throughout the decade.<ref name=elliott /> Southern rock fiddler [[Charlie Daniels]] later recalled that the Marshall Tucker Band "came onstage and just blew it out from start to finish."<ref name=alfonso>Barry Alfonso, Notes to ''The Marshall Tucker Band: Anthology'' [CD liner notes]. Ramblin' Records, 2005.</ref> 

Daniels' first of many collaborations with the Marshall Tucker Band came on the band's second album, ''[[A New Life (album)|A New Life]]'',<ref name=alfonso /> which was released in 1974, and certified gold in 1977.<ref name=elliott /> Daniels and blues guitarist [[Elvin Bishop]] were among several musicians that joined the band for ''[[Where We All Belong]]'',<ref name=alfonso /> a double-album (one studio album and one live album) released by the band in 1974 and certified gold that same year.

The following year the band's ''[[Searchin' for a Rainbow]]'' was also certified gold the year of its release, and contained the track "[[Fire on the Mountain (The Marshall Tucker Band song)|Fire on the Mountain]]," which peaked at No. 38 on the [[Billboard charts]]. ''[[Long Hard Ride]]'', the band's fifth consecutive gold album, was released in 1976,<ref name=alfonso /> and its instrumental title track (which again features Charlie Daniels on fiddle) was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]].<ref name=cortner>Amy Cortner, "Marshall Tucker Band." ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006). p. 1186.</ref>

''[[Carolina Dreams]]'', released in 1977 and certified platinum that same year, proved to be the band's most commercially successful album, and included the track "[[Heard It in a Love Song]]", which reached No. 14 on the Billboard charts.<ref name=elliott />  And the band's final Capricorn release came with 1978's ''[[Together Forever (The Marshall Tucker Band album)|Together Forever]]'', which was produced by [[Stewart Levine]].<ref name=alfonso />

Following the bankruptcy of Capricorn, the Marshall Tucker Band moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1979 for their ninth album, ''[[Running Like the Wind]]'' (the band's eighth release was a compilation album entitled ''Greatest Hits''), and they retained Levine as the album's producer.

In August 1979, the band played at [[Knebworth Festival 1979|Knebworth Festival]] in England. [[Led Zeppelin]] was the headline act at both of their festival appearances.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} Official Website Knebworth Festival - August 11, 1979|url=https://www.ledzeppelin.com/|access-date=2022-01-09|website=Led Zeppelin {{!}} Official Website - Official Website|language=en}}</ref>

===1980s===
On April 22, 1980, following the completion of the band's tenth album ''[[Tenth (The Marshall Tucker Band album)|Tenth]]'', bassist and co-founder Tommy Caldwell suffered massive head trauma in a car wreck and died six days later. Former Toy Factory bassist Franklin Wilkie replaced Caldwell for their next album, [[Dedicated (The Marshall Tucker Band album)|''Dedicated'']] (1981), but the band was never able to recapture its commercial success of the 1970s.

On 1982's ''Tuckerized'', which featured Ronnie Godfrey, who joined them as an additional keyboardist, only two songs were written by band members; "Sea, Dreams & Fairy Tales" by Toy Caldwell and "Sweet Elaine" by George McCorkle. And main songwriter Toy Caldwell only contributed three songs to each of their next two albums, both released in 1983; ''Just Us'' and ''Greetings from South Carolina''. Afterwards, all the rest of the original band members split in June 1984, except for Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks.<ref name=larkin />

During the summer of 1984, MTB toured with a revamped lineup featuring Gray, Eubanks, Spartanburg guitarist Rusty Milner and new Nashville players: Bob Wray (bass), [[James Stroud]] (drums), Kenny Mims (guitar) and [[Bobby Ogdin]] (keyboards).  But in 1985, Wray, Stroud and Mims were replaced respectively by session veteran [[Tom Robb]] (from [[Leslie West]]'s Wild West Show), Stuart Swanlund (guitars, slide guitar, pedal steel guitar, vocals) and  David "Ace" Allen (drums).

In 1988 Gray and Eubanks released the album ''Still Holdin' On'', their one and only release on the Mercury Records label, which had been recorded mostly back in 1985 in Nashville with the 84/85 mostly Nashville players lineup. 

Bassist Tim Lawter joined in 1987, and the newer members (including newly added, in 1989, keyboardist Don Cameron) had a much greater role on the band's 1990 album, ''Southern Spirit'', released on the Sisapa label. The album marked a return to the band's country and blues roots.<ref name=tuckerhead>Tuckerhead.com, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/still_holdin_on_review.htm ''Still Holdin' On'' Review]. 2002–2008. Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref>

===1990s===
In 1992 the Marshall Tucker Band produced its first album for the Cabin Fever label, ''Still Smokin'''. Just after the album's recording, drummer David "Frankie" Toler (ex-[[Allman Brothers Band]]) replaced Allen on drums and Mark Pettey replaced Don Cameron later that same year on keyboards.

The band's 1993 release, ''Walk Outside the Lines'', marked a transition to a more country sound, relying less on long improvised jams that were the trademark of the band's early career.<ref>Craig Cumberland, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/walk_review.htm ''Walk Outside the Lines'' Review]. Tuckerhead.com,  Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref> The album's title track was co-written by country music star [[Garth Brooks]], a long-time fan of the band who considered writing a track for them a "milestone" in his career.<ref name=elliott />

The band added Spartanburg-area guitarist Ronald Radford in 1993 to 1995 after Swanlund suffered a hand injury, and Radford appeared on 1998's ''Face Down In the Blues'', along with [[Firefall]]'s multi-instrumentalist David Muse, the latter replacing Jerry Eubanks who had retired in 1996. But Swanlund was back in the band from 1995 till his death in 2012 and Muse was there from 1996-2000, then again in 2003-2009.

Garry Guzzardo replaced drummer Toler in 1994-1996 and was succeeded by current drummer B.B. Borden (ex-[[Mother's Finest]]) in 1997, guitarist Chris Hicks joined in 1996, after a long stint in the [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]], and keyboardist Paul Thompson (who came in after Pettey left) was briefly a member in 1994, but was dropped pretty soon after and not replaced. He was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1998.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1998 - 1999|website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com}}</ref>

''Gospel'', the band's 1999 album, featured the band's rendition of traditional songs including [[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|"The Wayfaring Stranger"]], [[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|"Will the Circle Be Unbroken"]], and several original tracks.

===21st century===
[[Clay Cook]] (saxophone, flute, keyboards, vocals) was a member from 2000-2009 and Dave Muse returned in 2003-2009 before 
being succeeded by current man Marcus James Henderson in 2009. Longtime bassist Tim Lawter was succeeded by Tony Heatherly in 2001, who turned it over to Pat Elwood in 2004. Guitarist Rusty Milner left in 2003 and Stuart Swanland was there on and off (his health permitting) from 1985 until his death on August 5, 2012 at age 54. The current guitarists are Chris Hicks (since 1996) and Rick Willis (since 2009) and bassist Tony Black was there from 2017-2019. Ryan Ware has occupied the bass chair since the band returned to the road in 2021, after the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].   

The Marshall Tucker Band continued recording and performing into the 21st century, playing between 150 and 200 shows per year.<ref name=bio /> The band reissued many of its albums from the 1970s on its new Ramblin' Records label, as well as two two-disc compilations, the first (''Anthology'') being a 30-year retrospective and the second (''Where a Country Boy Belongs'') being a collection of the band's country songs. In 2004, they released another studio album, ''Beyond the Horizon'', and the following year released a Christmas album, ''Carolina Christmas''. In 2007 they released their newest studio album ''The Next Adventure''.

"Can't You See'" was used for the opening and closing credits of the [[Kevin Costner]] 2008 motion picture ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]''. "Take the Highway" was also used in the movie.

"Can't You See" is also used in the 2001 film ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'' and the 2017 film ''[[I, Tonya]]''.
