==Biography==
Linda Kaye Davis was born November 26, 1962, in [[Dodson, Texas]]. She first sang in public on a local radio show at age six. By the time she was 20, Davis had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she paired up with the singer Skip Eaton to form the duo Skip & Linda. They signed to MDJ Records and had three minor singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts.<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aifuxql5ldae~T1 |title=Linda Davis biography |access-date=October 28, 2008 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Davis later performed at a piano bar inside a [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton hotel]], when she was discovered by the record producer [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]].<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|author1=Stambler, I.|author2=Landon, G.|date=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312264871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C|page=122|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref>

Davis moved to Tennessee and became a receptionist for a small studio.  She occasionally sang demos and jingles. Shortly after starting her job she met a songwriter who became her husband: Lang Scott.  After marrying in August 1984,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homecomingmagazine.com/article/treasures-linda-davis/|title=In January 29, 2011 interview she says ''we have been married for almost 27 years''|website=Homecomingmagazine.com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>  they had two daughters: Their daughters are [[Hillary Scott]] (April 1, 1986) and Rylee Jean Scott (2000).

==Career==

===''In a Different Light'' and ''Linda Davis''===
Davis's first solo chart entry came in 1988 on [[Epic Records]], although it was not until 1991 that she released her first album ''[[In a Different Light (Linda Davis album)|In a Different Light]]'' on [[Liberty Records]]. This album produced two chart singles, but no Top 40 hits. That same year, Davis co-wrote the title track of [[Dawn Sears]]'s debut album ''[[What a Woman Wants to Hear]]''. A year later, Davis released her second album, ''[[Linda Davis (album)|Linda Davis]]'', which did not produce any chart singles at all. [[Reba McEntire]] then chose Davis as a backing vocalist for her road band.

==="Does He Love You" and ''Shoot for the Moon''===
Davis had her biggest chart success in 1993 when she and McEntire recorded their duet "[[Does He Love You]]". Davis's only number one country hit, it also won her and McEntire a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Country Vocal Collaboration that year.<ref name="allmusic2">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1578/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Linda Davis biography |access-date=October 28, 2008 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Soon afterward, Davis signed to [[Arista Nashville]] and recorded her third album, ''[[Shoot for the Moon (album)|Shoot for the Moon]]''. This album's first single, the [[Mac McAnally]] composition "Company Time", failed to enter the Top 40. It was followed by "Love Didn't Do It" at No.&nbsp;58. Davis, along with [[Trisha Yearwood]] and [[Martina McBride]], sang guest vocals on McEntire's mid-1995 cover version of the [[Patti LaBelle]]/[[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] song "[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)#Reba McEntire version|On My Own]]", although only McEntire received chart credit for it.

===''Some Things Are Meant to Be''===
Davis did not enter Top 40 on the country charts again until 1996 with the title track of her 1996 album ''[[Some Things Are Meant to Be]]'', her second album for Arista. This song peaked at No.&nbsp;13 on the country charts, becoming her highest solo chart position. Following it were "A Love Story in the Making" (co-written by the former [[NRBQ]] member [[Al Anderson (NRBQ)|Al Anderson]]) at No.&nbsp;33, and "Walk Away", which failed to chart. Also included on this album was the song "What Do I Know", released by [[Ricochet (band)|Ricochet]] the same year as its first single.

===''I'm Yours''===
Davis's fifth album, ''[[I'm Yours (Linda Davis album)|I'm Yours]]'', was released in 1998 on [[DreamWorks Records]], then a newly established record label. Its first single, "[[I Wanna Remember This]]", was used on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Black Dog (1998 film)|Black Dog]]''. The song peaked at No.&nbsp;20 in 1998, followed by the title track at No.&nbsp;38 and "From the Inside Out" at No.&nbsp;60. After this latter song, Davis left DreamWorks. She was signed to [[Kenny Rogers]]' Dreamcatcher Records in 2000.<ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=2000-12-23|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TxEEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TxEEAAAAMBAJ/page/n43 44]|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref>

===2003–present===
In 2003, Davis self-released a Christmas album with her husband, Lang Scott, and their daughter, [[Hillary Scott (singer)|Hillary]] (b. April 1, 1986). Two more self-released albums, ''I Have Arrived'' and ''Young at Heart'', followed in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Hillary founded the country music group [[Lady Antebellum|Lady A]] in 2006, who were known as Lady Antebellum up until 2020.

In 2009, Davis was inducted into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]].

Davis joined [[Lulu Roman]] (of [[Hee Haw]] fame) for a cover version of [[Anne Murray]]'s "[[You Needed Me]]" on Roman's 2013 album ''At Last''.

In 2013 & 2015, Davis toured with the late country singer [[Kenny Rogers]]. Davis also accompanied Rogers on his "The Gambler's Last Deal" retirement tour in 2017.
