They have released six albums, the latest being ''[[Tornillo_(album)|Tornillo]]'' released in July 2022.

==Music career==
In 2008, the band released their debut album, ''Road of Life''.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0001002713|pure_url=yes}} |title=Whiskey Myers Biography |last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=July 31, 2012}}</ref> Their second album, ''Firewater'', was released by Wiggy Thump in 2011 and debuted in the Top 30 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart, largely thanks to the single "Ballad of a Southern Man". On February 4, 2014, the album, ''Early Morning Shakes'', was released and received mostly positive reviews. In September 2016, their fourth album ''Mud'' was released. The band's self-titled album was released on September 27, 2019 followed by "Tornillo" in July 29, 2022.

The band started when friends Cody Cannon and John Jeffers began learning guitar together, inspired by the music of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Waylon Jennings]], amongst many other artists. After being joined by Cannon's co-worker and friend Cody Tate. After playing together for a while, the three decided to start a more serious band. They enlisted friend Jeff Hogg to play drums, and asked Cannon's cousin Gary Brown to play bass (although he did not know how to play the instrument at the time). They began playing shows around their hometown and native state of Texas, slowly starting to build a following on the Texas/Red Dirt scene.

In 2018, the band was featured in four episodes of the [[Kevin Costner]] [[Paramount Network]] series [[Yellowstone (American TV series)|''Yellowstone'']]. Shortly afterwards, the band's three available albums moved into the top 10 iTunes country chart. Their most recent album at the time, ''Mud'', reached No. 1 on the charts, and its song "Stone" reached No. 9 in all genres. 

On September 27, 2019, the band released the self-titled album, ''[[Whiskey Myers (album)|Whiskey Myers]]''. It debuted at No. 1 on ''Billboard'' Country,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8532434/whiskey-myers-no-1-top-country-albums |title=Whiskey Myers Scores First Top Country Albums No. 1, Jon Pardi & Sturgill Simpson Debut in Top 3|date=October 8, 2019 |first= Jim |last=Asker|magazine=Billboard }}</ref> No. 2 on ''Billboard'' active rock,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-mainstream-rock-tracks|title= Mainstream Rock Songs |magazine=Billboard }}</ref> and No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.entertainment-focus.com/music-section/ef-country/whiskey-myers-hit-billboard-200-top-10-with-new-self-titled-album/ |title=Whiskey Myers hit Billboard 200 Top 10 with new self-titled album |work=Entertainment Focus |date=15 October 2019 }}</ref>
