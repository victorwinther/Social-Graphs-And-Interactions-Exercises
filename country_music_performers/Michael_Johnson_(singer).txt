'''Michael Jay Johnson''' (August 8, 1944 – July 25, 2017) was an American pop, [[country music|country]], and [[folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter and guitarist. He is best remembered for his 1978 hit song "[[Bluer Than Blue]]". He charted four hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and nine more on [[Hot Country Songs]], including two number one country hits in 1986's "[[Give Me Wings]]" and "[[The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder]]". He also co-wrote "Cain's Blood", the debut single of 1990s country group [[4 Runner]].

==Career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}
Johnson was born in the small town of [[Alamosa, Colorado]] and grew up in [[Denver]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mjblue.com/|title=Michael Johnson: Singer & Guitarist|website=Mjblue.com|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> He started playing the guitar at 13. In 1963, he began attending Colorado State College (now the [[University of Northern Colorado]]) in Greeley to study music but his college career was truncated when he won an international talent contest two years later. First prize included a deal with [[Epic Records]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/bluer-than-blue-singer-michael-johnson-dead-at-72-w492020|title='Bluer Than Blue' Singer Michael Johnson Dead at 72|first=Stephen L.|last=Betts|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 27, 2017|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

Wishing to hone his instrumental skills, in 1966 he set off for [[Barcelona, Spain]], to the [[Liceu Conservatory]], studying with the eminent classical guitarists, Graciano Tarragó and [[Renata Tarragó]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjblue.com/bcountry.html|author=Barry McCloud|title=''Definitive Country: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Country Music and Its Performers'' (Perige, 1995).}}</ref> Upon his return to the States, he joined [[Randy Sparks]] in a group called the New Society and did a tour of the Orient.

When the band dissolved in 1967, he signed on with the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]] for a year, spending some of that time co-writing with another member, [[John Denver]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chadmitchelltrio.com/|title=Chad Mitchell Trio - Official Website|website=Chadmitchelltrio.com|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> The group was renamed Denver, Boise & Johnson. When the trio came to an end, Johnson made a radical departure from everything he had done previously by taking on a major supporting role in the off-Broadway production of ''[[Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris]].''<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/obituary/7881194/bluer-than-blue-michael-johnson-obit |title='Bluer Than Blue' Singer Michael Johnson Dies at 72 |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=July 27, 2017 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

In 1971, Johnson signed with [[Atco Records]] to record his first album, ''There Is A Breeze'', which was released in 1973 and produced by Johnson, Chris Dedrick, [[Peter Yarrow]] and [[Phil Ramone]] in New York and Toronto, Canada.<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=206/8}}</ref> Feeling this first effort was not a true reflection of his music (despite being a best seller in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area), Johnson self-produced his next LP in 1975, ''For All You Mad Musicians'', relying more on his voice and guitar for a folk feel. He followed this up with ''Ain't Dis Da Life'', where he added a rhythm section. With each new recording and his continued touring, his popularity was increasing.

Teaming up with [[Brent Maher]] and Steve Gibson in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Johnson created a two-song demo consisting of "[[Bluer Than Blue]]" and "[[Almost Like Being in Love]]" (the latter song from the Broadway musical ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]''). [[EMI America]] took one listen and wasted no time in signing him, quickly getting ''The Michael Johnson Album'' out in 1978. "Bluer Than Blue" was written by Randy Goodrum. The first single, "Bluer Than Blue", became Johnson's first [[Top 40]] hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the summer of 1978;<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> the song became a chart-topping single on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary]] chart. "Almost Like Being in Love" went to No.&nbsp;91 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart while hitting the Top 5 on the AC chart and the Top 40 on the pop chart. 

Johnson recorded five albums in all for EMI and in 1985 moved over to [[RCA Records]],<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> where he adopted a contemporary country style that stayed compatible with his soft, mellow leanings. He scored five Top Ten country hits from 1986 to 1989, including the chart-toppers "Give Me Wings" and "The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder."<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After two country albums on RCA (plus two greatest hits collections), Johnson moved over to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1991.

In 1995, the country music group [[4 Runner]] scored a minor hit with the single "[[Cain's Blood]]", for which Johnson co-wrote an updated version with Jack Sundrud of [[Poco (band)|Poco]].

==Death==
Johnson died at his home in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]] on July 25, 2017, two weeks before what would have been his 73rd birthday.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/bluer-than-blue-singer-michael-johnson-dies-at-72/436868903|title='Bluer Than Blue' Singer Michael Johnson dies at 72|first=Jon|last=Bream|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>
