'''Donald Ralph "Skip" Ewing''' (born March 6, 1964) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. Active since 1988, Ewing has recorded nine studio albums and has charted 15 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts.

==Career==
Ewing was born in [[Redlands, California]], United States. He first began to gain national attention during the mid-1980s, both as a songwriter and recording artist for [[MCA Records|MCA]] and [[Capitol Records]]. His 1988 debut, ''The Coast of Colorado'', produced the number 3 hit "[[Burnin' a Hole in My Heart]]" and four other top 20 country hits. ''The Will to Love'' included the top 5 hit "It's You Again". Although none of Ewing's subsequent chart entries made the Top 40, he released eight more albums from 1990 to 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/skip-ewing-mn0000015072|title=Skip Ewing biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>

Ewing is a notable attendee of [[Columbine High School]] in [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]], Colorado, and [[Redlands High School]] in [[Redlands, California]].

In 1990, Ewing wrote two songs for [[Kenny Rogers]]' album ''[[Love Is Strange (album)|Love Is Strange]]'': "Listen to the Rain" and "If I Were a Painting".

In 2008, he served as the duet partner of the radio version of [[Reba McEntire]]'s single, "Every Other Weekend". He also co-wrote the single; the song reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Country Chart. Although the song was credited for one week to Ewing and [[Kenny Chesney]] as ""Every Other Weekend" by Reba McEntire and Skip Ewing or Kenny Chesney", the song was thereafter credited to McEntire alone on the chart.

== Awards ==
* [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI) Songwriter of the Year 2000;
* Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) Song of the Year;
* [[Country Music Association]] (CMA) Triple Play Award (three No.&nbsp;1 songs within 12 months).

Additionally, Ewing has received a CMA Song of the Year nomination, a Grammy nomination, a Tony nomination and multiple BMI "Million Air" awards.

== Horse and Writer ==
Horse and Writer is an annual songwriting retreat Skip Ewing organizes every year with members of the [[Nashville]] songwriting community. The retreat lasts six days, and takes place at the Triangle C Ranch in [[Dubois, Wyoming]]. The mission is to help aspiring songwriters realize their potential, as they are mentored by experienced pros like Ewing, who describes the event as "a labor of love."
