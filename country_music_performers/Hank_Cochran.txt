== Biography ==
Hank Cochran was born August 2, 1935, in [[Isola, Mississippi]], during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Hank Cochran Historical Marker |url=https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=77169 |access-date=2022-10-26 |website=www.hmdb.org |language=en}}</ref> By the time he turned three, Cochran already had pneumonia, whooping cough, measles, and mumps. The doctor feared he wouldn't survive to adulthood. His parents divorced when he was nine years old. He then moved with his father to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and was placed in an [[orphanage]]. After running away twice, he then was sent to live with his grandparents, in [[Greenville, Mississippi]]. His uncle Otis Cochran taught him to play the guitar as the pair [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] from Mississippi to southeastern [[New Mexico]] to work in the [[oilfield]]s.<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06>Watkins, Billy. – "Everybody wants to sing". – ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]''. – August 6, 2003.</ref> After returning to Mississippi as a teenager, Cochran went to California and picked olives. While there, he formed The Cochran Brothers, a duo with [[Eddie Cochran]].<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 />

In 1960 at the age of 24, he hitchhiked for Hollywood, but ended up going to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and teamed with [[Harlan Howard]] to write the song "[[I Fall to Pieces]]".<ref name="Larkin" /> <ref name=":0" />It became a major success for [[Patsy Cline]] (recorded November 16, 1960), reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard country music charts]] and No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (chart for all music categories). Cline also recorded Cochran's "[[She's Got You]]" (recorded December 17, 1961, it was another major hit, No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts and No.&nbsp;14 on the Hot 100), and "Why Can't He Be You" (recorded September 5, 1962).

In 1960, during a date at a movie theater, the film inspired him to compose a new song. He left the theater quickly, and by the time he got home fifteen minutes later, composed "[[Make the World Go Away]]." [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] recorded the song, and it scored No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard country charts in 1963. The next year [[Eddy Arnold]], who recorded it in as a pop-oriented Nashville Sound arrangement, made the song his signature hit and one of the biggest sellers in country music history, scoring No.&nbsp;1 on the country music charts, then in 1965 No.&nbsp;6 on the overall Billboard Hot 100 charts (his highest rated song ever).<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 /> <ref name=":0" />Arnold also recorded the song "[[I Want to Go with You]]".<ref name="Larkin" /> 

Cochran wrote several successful songs sung by [[Burl Ives]] ("[[A Little Bitty Tear]]", "[[Funny Way of Laughin']]", "The Same Old Hurt"). He also wrote songs for [[George Strait]] ("[[The Chair (song)|The Chair]]" with [[Dean Dillon]] and "[[Ocean Front Property (song)|Ocean Front Property]]" with Dillon and Royce Porter), [[Keith Whitley]] ("[[Miami, My Amy]]" also with Dillon and Porter), [[Merle Haggard]] ("It's Not Love (But It's Not Bad)"), "Don't You Ever Get Tired (of Hurting Me)", a No. 1 scoring record for [[Ronnie Milsap]], and [[Mickey Gilley]] ("That's All That Matters").

While working at publishing company Pamper Music, some evenings, he performed in a Nashville tavern named [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]]. While there, he noticed an amazing new talent. He encouraged management to contract the young songwriter, [[Willie Nelson]], giving Nelson a raise owed to him at the time.<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 />

Two of his fondest memories were working with [[Natalie Cole]] (among other artists) on a 2003 tribute album to Patsy Cline (''[[Remembering Patsy Cline]]''), because of his love for her father [[Nat King Cole]],<ref name=WatkinsB-CL-2003-08-06 /> and his collaboration with [[Vern Gosdin]] for the 1988 album ''[[Chiseled in Stone (album)|Chiseled in Stone]]'' (Gosdin's highest rated album at No.&nbsp;7).<ref>Cooper, Peter. – "The man, the mystery and the mega-hits". – ''[[The Tennessean]]''. – March 23, 2007.</ref>

In 2008, singer Lea Anne Creswell came to Cochran's home to choose songs for a new album, subsequently called ''Lea Anne Sings Hank Cochran and ...''.<ref>Moon, Troy. – "Songwriter lends talent to CD, but will Willie be at release party?". – ''[[Pensacola News Journal]]''. – May 18, 2001.</ref>
