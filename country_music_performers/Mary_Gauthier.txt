'''Mary Veronica Gauthier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|ʃ|eɪ}} {{respell|GOH|shay}}; born March 11, 1962) is a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]]-nominated American [[folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter and author, whose songs have been covered by performers including [[Tim McGraw]], [[Blake Shelton]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Boy George]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Bettye Lavette]], [[Candi Staton]], and [[Amy Helm]].

Mary's songs often deal with marginalization, informed by her experience of adoption, addiction and recovery, and growing up gay in the deep south. Her work demonstrates an "ability to transform her own trauma into a purposeful and communal narrative", such as the lyric "we could all use, a little mercy, now", from her song "[[Mercy Now]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/27/580429847/reworking-trauma-mary-gauthier-tells-veteran-stories-on-rifles-rosary-beads|title = Reworking Trauma: Mary Gauthier Tells Veteran Stories on 'Rifles & Rosary Beads'| website=NPR.org }}</ref>

When she was fifteen she ran away from home, recalling that "I was a gay kid, and back then, that just didn’t fly. Back then, gay kids were beat up, abused, some ended up taking their own lives. It was horrible, and I just wanted to get away.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetiesthatbindus.org/mary-gauthier-im-so-glad-ive-remained-willing-to-do-what-it-takes/|title = Mary Gauthier: 'I'm so glad I've remained willing to do what it takes'| newspaper=The Ties That Bind Us |date = 20 August 2018}}</ref> Mary spent the next several years in [[drug rehabilitation]], [[halfway house]]s, living with friends, and spent her eighteenth birthday in a jail cell.<ref name=Reighley /> These experiences provided fodder for her songwriting later on.

===''Rifles & Rosary Beads''===
Gauthier's next record, ''Rifles & Rosary Beads'' (2018), was co-written with U.S. veterans and their families, arising out of Mary's involvement with the [[SongwritingWith:Soldiers|Songwriting With Soldiers]] program. Mary notes that "[every] day, on average, twenty-two veterans commit suicide", adding that "[underneath] so much of the problems in the world is trauma, it's the central issue humanity is dealing with. We've found something powerful here, that brings hope to people who are hurting".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marygauthier.com/about|title = About}}</ref>

The album was released to widespread acclaim, and has been described as "music that's just plain important" (''[[The LA Times]]''), and as being "not only the strongest album of her career but, in its own way, a landmark album."<ref name="countrystandardtime.com"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-mary-gauthier-mccabes-review-20181209-story.html|title = Mary Gauthier taps 'Rifles & Rosary Beads' songs written with vets in McCabe's performance| website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date = 9 December 2018}}</ref> It has won several awards, and secured Mary her first Grammy nomination.
