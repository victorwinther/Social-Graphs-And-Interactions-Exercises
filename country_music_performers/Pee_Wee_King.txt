'''Julius Frank Anthony Kuczynski'''<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=220}}</ref> (February 18, 1914 – March 7, 2000),<ref name="Guardian"/> known professionally as '''Pee Wee King''', was an American [[country music]] songwriter and recording artist best known for co-writing "[[Tennessee Waltz]]".

Pee Wee King is credited with bringing the musicians union to the Grand Ole Opry — he was one of the first musicians in Nashville to carry a union card, and to have the members of his band work union.  He also served on the board of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].

==Life and career==
King was born in [[Abrams (CDP), Wisconsin|Abrams, Wisconsin]] to a Polish American family, and lived in Abrams during his youth. He learned to play the accordion from his father, who was a professional [[polka]] musician. In the 1930s, he toured and made cowboy movies with [[Gene Autry]].<ref name=miller>Miller, James. ''Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947–1977''. Simon & Schuster (1999), pp. 44–45. {{ISBN|0-684-80873-0}}.</ref> King joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1937, with the help of his father-in-law [[Joseph Frank (promoter)|J.L. Frank]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

In 1946, while he was the bandleader of the Golden West Cowboys,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> King, together with the band's vocalist, [[Redd Stewart]], composed "The Tennessee Waltz", inspired by "The Kentucky Waltz" by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] musician [[Bill Monroe]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> King and Stewart first recorded "The Tennessee Waltz" in 1948.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> It went on to become a country music standard, due, mainly, to the immense success of [[Patti Page]]'s version of the song.

King had the ''Pee Wee King Show'' on [[WAVE (TV)|WAVE-TV]] in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1949, with the Golden West Cowboys and announcer Bob Kay. The half-hour program was broadcast at 7:15&nbsp;p.m. on Mondays.<ref name=v>{{cite magazine |date=February 16, 1949 |page=36 |title=Pee Wee King Show |magazine=Variety |url=https://archive.org/details/variety173-1949-02/page/n155/mode/1up?view=theater |accessdate=January 29, 2023 }}</ref>

King wrote or co-wrote more than four hundred songs and recorded more than twenty albums and 157 singles. His other songs included "[[Slow Poke]]" and "[[You Belong to Me (1952 song)|You Belong to Me]]", both co-authored with [[Chilton Price]] and [[Redd Stewart]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His songs introduced [[waltz]]es, polkas, and [[Cowboy music|cowboy songs]] to country music.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> King became one of the charter members of the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

King was not permitted to use the drummer and trumpeter he featured in his stage shows when the band played at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], where both instruments were banned. He ignored that ban only once, appearing at the Ryman in April 1945 following the death of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. The Opry had been canceled, but since a number of fans showed up, management decided to have King perform his stage show for them, performing as he did outside the Opry. He used his full band, with drums and trumpet. When confronted about it afterward, King told Opry emcee [[George D. Hay]] that he had done his stage show, as asked. Bob Wills had defied the Opry ban on drums a year earlier during a 1944 guest appearance.<ref>Kienzle, Richard. (2003). Southwest shuffle: pioneers of honky-tonk, Western swing, and country jazz.

His band also introduced on-stage dancing and [[Nudie Cohn]]'s customized 'rhinestone cowboy' outfits,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nudiesrodeotailor.com/gallery/galleryfashion06a.html |title=Nudies Rodeo Tailors official website of Nudies suits |publisher=Nudiesrodeotailor.com |access-date=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329171929/http://www.nudiesrodeotailor.com/gallery/galleryfashion06a.html |archive-date=March 29, 2012 }}</ref> which later became popular with Nashville and country musicians, including [[Elvis Presley]], to the Opry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=135#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813041602/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=135|url-status=dead|title=Pee Wee King|work=Country Music Hall of Fame.com|archive-date=August 13, 2007|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1974.
