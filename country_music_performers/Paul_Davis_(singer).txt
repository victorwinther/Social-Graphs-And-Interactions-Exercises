'''Paul Lavon Davis''' (April 21, 1948 – April 22, 2008)<ref name=MeridianStar/> was an American singer and songwriter, best known for his radio hits and solo career that started worldwide in 1970. His career encompassed [[soul music|soul]], [[country music|country]], and pop. His most successful songs are 1977's "[[I Go Crazy (Paul Davis song)|I Go Crazy]]", a No. 7 pop hit that once held the record for the longest chart run on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and 1982's "[['65 Love Affair]]", which at No. 6 is his highest-charting single. Another pop hit, "[[Cool Night (song)|Cool Night]]", was released in 1981. In the mid-1980s, he also had two No. 1 country hits as a guest vocalist on songs by [[Marie Osmond]] and [[Tanya Tucker]].

==Early life, family and education==

Davis was born in [[Meridian, Mississippi]], US.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=643}}</ref>  His father was a preacher.<ref>{{cite AV media| authorlink= Casey Kasem| first= Casey |last= Kasem| title=[[American Top 40]]| date= January 21, 1978}}</ref>

==Career==
Paul Davis was a member of a local music group, the Six Soul Survivors, around 1966 and later in another group, the Endless Chain. In 1968, he was a writer for [[Malaco Records]], based in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. [[Ilene Berns]], widow of [[Bert Berns]], signed Davis to [[Bang Records]] in 1969, and in 1970, released a [[cover version]] of [[The Jarmels]]' hit "[[A Little Bit of Soap]]", reaching No. 52 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> His first album, ''A Little Bit of Paul Davis'', was released in 1970. In 1974, he recorded his third album, ''Ride 'Em Cowboy'', and the title track, his first top 40 single, peaked at No. 23 on January 18, 1975.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> (The same song became a Top 40 Country hit for [[Juice Newton]] in 1984.) Davis also reached No. 35 in September 1976 with "Superstar", a tribute song not related to any of the 1971 hits by that name.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Davis had his first American Top 10 single with the ballad "[[I Go Crazy (Paul Davis song)|I Go Crazy]]", which after 30 weeks on the Hot 100 peaked at No. 7 on March 18, 1978.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  "I Go Crazy" spent 40 weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which at the time set the record for most weeks on the chart.   The follow-up, "[[Sweet Life (Paul Davis song)|Sweet Life]]", also did well, peaking at No. 17.  On May 17, 1980, his gospel-tinged "[[Do Right (Paul Davis song)|Do Right]]" peaked at No. 23, and [[Casey Kasem]] noted the religious aspects of this song, along with other songs before it, on that day's edition of [[American Top 40]].  Davis was active on Bang Records when the label folded in the early 1980s.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn]] Presents: The Billboard Hot 100 charts, The Seventies; Joel Whitburn's Top Pop singles: 1955–2010</ref>

After one more album on the Bang label, Davis signed with [[Arista Records]] in 1981 and scored two more hits, "[[Cool Night (song)|Cool Night]]" (which in February 1982 reached No. 11 on the Hot 100 and No. 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart) and "[['65 Love Affair]]" (a Top 10 hit on both charts).<ref name="LarkinGE"/> "Cool Night" has been listed as an example of [[yacht rock]].<ref name="Browne">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/yacht-rock-album-guide-1175018/|title=Yacht Rock: Album Guide|first=David|last=Browne|website=Rollingstone.com|date=June 22, 2021|access-date=August 22, 2021}}</ref> His Arista debut album spawned a third hit with a remake of "[[Love or Let Me Be Lonely]]". The single contained a third verse of music which was not included on the album version, and despite its Top 40 and AC success, had never been reissued on any CD release until [[Wounded Bird]] reissued the ''Best of Paul Davis'' compilation in 2011. Despite his success during this time frame, Davis grew increasingly disillusioned with the industry.  Davis retired from making records in 1983, except for two duets that went to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles]] chart. The first was in 1986 with [[Marie Osmond]] singing "[[You're Still New to Me]]";<ref name="LarkinGE"/> while the second, in 1988, was a collaboration with [[Tanya Tucker]] and [[Paul Overstreet]] singing "[[I Won't Take Less Than Your Love]]". Davis also wrote "[[Meet Me in Montana]]", which his friend [[Dan Seals]] and Osmond took to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' country chart in 1985, and [[Bop (Dan Seals song)|"Bop"]], a solo No. 1 country hit for Seals in early 1986. Davis left the music industry for good in 1988.

==Personal life and death==
Davis was married to Pamela Gayle Jay Davis, who enjoyed a brief career with Bang Records/Web IV Music in [[Atlanta]], where Davis wrote and recorded his songs. When their only son, Jonathan, was born with developmental problems, Pamela retired from the music world to care for him. She died on March 20, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://obituaries.meridianstar.com/obituary/pamela-davis-1952-2017-894490142 |title=Pamela Gayle Jay Davis Obituary |newspaper=[[The Meridian Star]] |access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

Davis was an avid golfer,<ref>{{cite web| first= Chris |last= Brennaman|date=April 2, 2008|title=Remembering Paul Davis|url=http://www.wtok.com/news/headlines/18006404.html|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150610215900/http://www.wtok.com/news/headlines/18006404.html|archive-date=June 10, 2015|access-date=June 25, 2014|publisher=[[WTOK-FM]]| website=tok.com}}</ref> and was also an avid [[Cue sports|billiards]] enthusiast.

Paul Davis survived a shooting in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on July 29, 1986. He was leaving a hotel on Music Row with a female companion when an unidentified man approached, demanded his wallet, and shot him in the abdomen.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-T1WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=--kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5389%2C4488363 |title=Singer Paul Davis shot |newspaper=[[The Gainesville Sun]] |page=2A |date=July 31, 1986}}</ref>
