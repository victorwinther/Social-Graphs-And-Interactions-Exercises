== Biography ==
McCoy was born in [[Barrie, Ontario]] and was raised for a time in [[Camrose, Alberta]] before his family settled in [[Anten Mills, Ontario]]. At around the age of 5, his family moved to [[Camrose, Alberta]], returning three years later. "The cowboy culture really stuck with me. I just fell in love with the music. For some reason, as a little kid, I had some sort of connection with these guys who were singing about these depressing things," McCoy said, citing [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Johnny Cash]] to lesser known artists like [[Ed Bruce]] and [[Wynn Stewart]]. "I just didn't have a voice for rock 'n' roll." Jason started playing guitar at age 7<ref name="jasonbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.andersonenterprises.ca/newjasonbiopage1.htm |title=Jason McCoy |website=Andersonenterprises.ca |access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> and wrote his first song when he was 12.<ref name="jasonbio" />

In his teens, McCoy owned an electric guitar and was partial to [[AC/DC]]. In the 1980s, he joined a band called Three Quarter Country, which performed at [[Royal Canadian Legion|legion halls]], Saturday night dances, and clubs in [[Barrie]], [[Midland, Ontario|Midland]], [[Orillia]] and other small towns. McCoy won a talent contest in Barrie, Ontario where he was discovered by country music writer Henry McGuirk who later became his manager and arranged for him to travel to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to record an album with producer Ray Griff. He later signed with [[MCA Nashville Records|MCA Records]] in 1995.

On May 1, 1999, McCoy married his longtime girlfriend Terrine Barnes. The couple have two children.

McCoy was a member of the country-rock group [[The Road Hammers]] from 2005 to 2010, which also featured musicians Clayton Bellamy and Chris Byrne, and earlier, Corbett Frasz. His first album in seven years, the live ''[[Christmas at the Grand]]'', was released on November 2, 2010, while his first studio album in eight years, [[Everything (Jason McCoy album)|Everything]], was released on March 1, 2011.

In 2017, McCoy began a radio career on KICX 106 in Orillia, Ontario while continuing his music career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barrietoday.com/amp/local-news/country-music-star-mccoy-launches-radio-career-519070 |title= Country music star McCoy launches radio career|website=BarrieToday|date= January 25, 2017|access-date=2021-02-08}}</ref> After KICX was purchased by iheartradio, McCoy also began hosting syndicated programming across the Pure Country Network.
