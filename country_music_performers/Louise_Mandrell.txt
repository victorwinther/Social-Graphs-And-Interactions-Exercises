'''Thelma Louise Mandrell''' (born July 13, 1954)<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> is an American [[country music]] [[music artist (occupation)|singer]]. She is the younger sister of fellow country singer [[Barbara Mandrell]], and older sister of actress [[Irlene Mandrell]]. Louise had a successful singing career in [[country music]] from the 1970s, with a string of hits during the 1980s.

==Early life==
Thelma Louise Mandrell was born in 1954,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wtop.com/media-galleries/2016/07/celebrity-birthdays-week-july-10-16/slide/1/|title=Celebrity birthdays for the week of July 10–16|date=July 10, 2016|publisher=WTOP|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> to Mary Ellen ([[Birth name#Maiden and married names|née]] McGill; born 1931) and Irby Matthew Mandrell (October 11, 1924 – March 5, 2009) in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541876/bio|title=Louise Mandrell|publisher=IMDb|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> She is the second of three daughters. Sister [[Barbara Mandrell|Barbara]] is five and a half years older; sister [[Irlene Mandrell|Irlene]] is one and a half years younger. Her mother, Mary, was a homemaker and musician hailing from rural [[Wayne County, Illinois|Wayne County]], Illinois. Her father Irby was a [[World War II]] naval veteran and [[Texas]] police officer from [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]], Arkansas. Irby Mandrell was an accomplished musician and entrepreneur as well. He used his impeccable social skills and knowledge of the music industry to manage all three of his daughters' careers for over three decades.

Although Louise Mandrell never developed the scale of fan base or the worldwide recognition that her older sister [[Barbara Mandrell|Barbara]] gained in [[country music]], she is still credited as one of country music's more successful female vocalists of the 1980s. With their parents coming from a musical background, Barbara started off working as a singer, and playing the [[steel guitar]] and other instruments, and toured with [[Patsy Cline]] in the early 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1683428/the-first-families-of-country-music/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630064602/http://www.cmt.com/news/1683428/the-first-families-of-country-music/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 30, 2015|title=The First Families of Country Music|work=CMT News|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Mandrell learned to play the guitar and bass. Soon, their parents founded the Mandrell Family Band, which toured the United States and Asia.

Barbara's professional recognition in [[country music]] in the early 1970s with hits like "[[Tonight My Baby's Coming Home]]" and "[[The Midnight Oil]]" gave Louise opportunities at success.  She started performing in Barbara's band The DoRites in 1969.<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=259}}</ref> Her first time in the studio was on the recording "[[Always Wanting You]]", a no. 1 hit for country singer-songwriter and [[Bakersfield sound]] pioneer [[Merle Haggard]] in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1978, she signed with [[Epic Records]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

==Music career==
Mandrell released her first single in 1978, called "Put It On Me", which appeared in the lower reaches of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine’s country music singles chart.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1979, she released her next single, a cover version of "[[Everlasting Love]]", another minor country hit.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> She started singing duets with her husband R.C. Bannon, such as "I Thought You'd Never Ask," which entered the top 50, and a cover of the pop/R&B number 1 song by [[Peaches & Herb]], "[[Reunited (song)|Reunited]]", which went to number 13, her first significant hit.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1980, following two more solo efforts that did not see the same success, she joined sisters Barbara and [[Irlene Mandrell|Irlene]] on the TV variety show ''[[Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters]]''.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> This show showcased not only her singing, but her multi-instrumental and comedy talents as well. In 1981, she signed with [[RCA Records]]. In 1982, Mandrell had two top 40 hits, as well as the top 20 hit "Some of My Best Friends Are Old Songs".

1983 turned out to be her most successful year.  She entered the top 15 with "Runaway Heart," and had the two top 10 hits "[[Save Me (Clodagh Rodgers song)|Save Me]]" (originally recorded by Northern Irish singer [[Clodagh Rodgers]]) and "[[Too Hot to Sleep (song)|Too Hot to Sleep]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1984, Mandrell had two other Top 40 hits, "Goodbye Heartache" and "[[I'm Not Through Loving You Yet (Louise Mandrell song)|I'm Not Through Loving You Yet]]" (co-written by [[Holly Dunn]]), and in 1985 the song "[[I Wanna Say Yes]]" entered the top 5.

[[File:Louise Mandrell at Jamboree.jpg|thumb|left|Louise Mandrell and [[James G. Howes]] a visiting National Council Representative from the [[West Central Florida Council]] at the [[1993 National Scout Jamboree]], [[Fort Walker|Fort A.P. Hill]], Virginia]] 
In 1985, RCA released her first music video for the hit single "[[Some Guys Have All The Luck|Some Girls Have All The Luck]]", a female-centric cover version of the 1973 hit song recorded by [[The Persuaders (R&B group)|The Persuaders]] and [[Rod Stewart]].

Mandrell's last studio album ''Dreamin''' was released in 1987, with the single "[[I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips]]" and having her last top 40 hit with the single "Do I Have To Say Goodbye". Her last charted single came in 1988 with a cover of the song "As Long As We Got Each Other", a duet with [[Eric Carmen]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The latter was the theme song of the 1985-1992 television sitcom ''[[Growing Pains]]''.

RCA and Mandrell parted ways in 1988. During the early 1990s, she released the videos and songs "Jean Paul" (written by R.C. Bannon) and "Down Home Christmas". Both songs are extremely hard to find, and “Jean Paul” appears in ''Anthology'', a 1998 compilation album containing many of her successful hits from the Epic and RCA years, which is ''also'' hard to find.

Mandrell was named the official 'Sweetheart of Tennessee.'

She was the unanimous choice of 50 Tennessee city managers -- the first time the city manager's association has so honored anyone. Mandrell accepted 50 inscribed crimson hearts from the managers and, in return, entertained them with a few tunes. She also was named 1981's 'Yellow Rose of Texas' by the Texas state legislature, another first.

==Personal life==
Her marriage to Ronald Shaw on July 1, 1971, ended in divorce in 1973.  She subsequently married Gary Lamar Buck of the country music group [[The Four Guys]] on July 23, 1975. They divorced in 1978.

In 1978, Mandrell met [[R.C. Bannon]].  They married on February 26, 1979. He co-wrote a few songs for Louise’s sister Barbara. "One of a Kind Pair of Fools" is a 1983 single written by Bannon and [[John Bettis]] and recorded by Barbara Mandrell.  "Only One Love in My Life," also written by R.C. Bannon and John Bettis, was [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s 10th number 1.

Mandrell and Bannon adopted Nicole Mandrell Shipley in 1986.  The couple divorced in 1991 and she married, for a fourth time, to John Haywood on July 16, 1993.

She became a grandmother for the first time in 2013.

==Theater and writing==
After leaving RCA Records, Mandrell continued to perform. In 1991, [[The Nashville Network]] began re-airing ''Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters''.

From 1992 to 1994, she headlined at the 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre in [[Branson, Missouri]] along with [[Kenny Rogers]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} On occasion, she shared the stage with Barbara, [[Sawyer Brown]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and several other well-known country and pop music entertainers at The Grand Palace.

On September 12, 1997, Mandrell opened her own 1,400-seat theater, ''[[Smoky Mountain Opry Theater|The Louise Mandrell Theater]]'' in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]], in the heart of the [[Smoky Mountains]] in [[Tennessee]], alongside other theaters such as [[Lee Greenwood]]'s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Battle|first1=Bob|title=Louise Mandrell to add theater to Pigeon Forge|work=Nashville Banner|date=December 17, 1996|quote=In the latest in a series of major entertainment features in the Smokies, singer Louise Mandrell plans to open her proposed 1,400-seat theater in the Music Road Entertainment Park at Pigeon Forge, Tenn., in the fall of 1997.}}</ref> Mandrell appeared in every performance there and encompassed numerous musical styles, including country, [[jazz]], and [[big band]]. It was considered the most attended (non-dinner) show in the Smoky Mountains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The [[Triumphant Quartet]], formerly known as the ''Integrity Quartet'', was the in-house [[Southern gospel]] group and back-up singers for Louise.

The theater is now home to the "Smoky Mountain Opry."{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1983, Mandrell co-wrote ''The Mandrell Family Album'' with writer Ace Collins. Later, they produced a series of children's books.

In 2012, she performed the title role of "Calamity Jane" at [[Roger Rocka's Dinner Theatre]] in [[Fresno, California]] through September 16, 2012. Mandrell reprised her role from July until September 15, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rogerrockas.com/events/categories/|title=Categories|website=Rogerrockas.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

Mandrell's final Christmas show at Gaylord Opryland titled "Louise Mandrell's Christmas Dinner Party" took place on November 18 – December 25, 2011.

After 30 years, she released ''Playing Favorites'', her most recent studio album consisting of country standards, on October 4, 2019. It was produced by [[Buddy Cannon]].

Mandrell appeared on the Opry's country classic show in Nashville. The last time she performed on that stage was 50 years ago. The show was broadcast live on the radio program, Opry Country Classics at the Ryman Auditorium, October 3, 2019. She performed on the Grand Ole Opry live from the Ryman on November 30, 2019.

In the 1980s, the Mandrell sisters were impersonated by the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on [[NBC]]. 
In 2007, [[Pam Tillis]] released a song called "Band in the Window", which name-checks Louise Mandrell ("her name is Louise but not Mandrell, she has 80's hair and fringe"). In 2023, Canadian country artist [[Lisa Brokop]] released her female-centric cover version of the [[George Jones]] country hit "[[Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes]]" (as "Who's Gonna Fill Their Heels"), and it is where the Mandrell sisters are mentioned among the names of country’s greatest female artists.
