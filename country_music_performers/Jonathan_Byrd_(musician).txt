'''Jonathan Byrd''' (born 1970 in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]]) is an American singer-songwriter based in [[Carrboro]], [[North Carolina]].  He is best known for his narrative tales of love, life, and death in America.  In 2003, he was among the winners of the New Folk competition at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]].  He set a record for CD sales at the festival that year, making more sales than the main stage acts.  His song, "The Ballad of Larry" has been listed a "Top Rated Song" by Americana-UK.  He primarily performs solo and accompanies himself in a variety of traditional acoustic guitar styles.  His recordings have featured a variety of instrumental ensembles and typically include one or more [[instrumental]] tracks that feature Byrd's skillful [[flatpicking]] technique.  Occasionally he also appears with the [[Athens, Georgia]] based [[world music]] duo, [[Dromedary (band)|Dromedary]].

Jonathan Byrd teamed up with Chris Kokesh after meeting her at the Americana Song Academy and the duo released a self-titled album under the name The Barn Birds in 2013.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode164 episode 164 of the Americana Music Show], released November 4, 2013</ref>

In 2014, Byrd released You Can't Outrun The Radio, a collection of songs inspired by an impromptu song circle in 2009 at the Green Room in Montreal.<ref>from an interview published on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode223 episode 223 of the Americana Music Show], released December 8, 2014</ref>
