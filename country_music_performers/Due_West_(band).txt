'''Due West''' is an American [[country music]] group composed of Matt Lopez, Tim Gates, and Brad Hull.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,gac_26071_5945075,00.html|title=Artists A to Z: Due West|work=[[Great American Country]]|accessdate=28 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230103355/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_5945075,00.html|archive-date=30 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Due West was founded in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 2004, and was almost signed to a contract with [[RCA Records]] Nashville in 2006, but lost the deal due to the merger of Sony Music and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. By 2009, the band self-released its debut single "I Get That All the Time,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/new-artist-spotlight-due-west-/|title=New Artist Spotlight: Rising Stars Due West Are In Perfect Harmony|last=Dauphin|first=Chuck|date=11 April 2011|work=Roughstock|accessdate=12 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104005013/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/new-artist-spotlight-due-west-/|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref> which was also made into a [[music video]], which has aired on [[Great American Country]]. In 2011 their second single, "When the Smoke Clears," was released as a [[music video]], Roman White was the producer.  Both "I Get That All the Time" and "When the Smoke Clears" made it into [[Great American Country]]'s top 20. The trio also released a self-titled album on April 27, 2010. A second album, ''Forget the Miles'', followed in 2011.

After parting ways with their label in 2013, they headed to popular crowd sourcing platform [[Kickstarter]] to raise funds to record and release a new album independently. They raised more than 150% of their goal (over $30,000). They entered the studio, this time with a new producer, [[Brandon Metcalf]], who was previously a Seattle-based rock producer and new to Nashville, to create what they have said are the "best songs we've ever recorded."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldsmag.com/article/1/13064|title=Due West Does Country Music Right|last=McBride|first=Erin Ann|date=2 Aug 2013|work=Meridian Magazine|accessdate=18 Oct 2013}}</ref> Together, they crafted the ''Move Like That'' EP, which is their highest-charting album to date. The title track was co-penned by hit [[songwriter]] [[Jimmy Robbins]]. The lead off single, "Slide On Over", was written by [[Erin Enderlin]], [[Dylan Scott]] and Will Bowen.

Due West entered the studio with Metcalf again in August 2013 to record a Christmas album, released on November 26, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DueWestMusic|title=CHRISTMAS ALBUM & TOUR - 2013|last=Lopez|first=Matt Ann|date=4 Oct 2013|work=Facebook|accessdate=18 Oct 2013}}</ref>

After a few year pause, Matt, Tim and Brad reunited in 2019 to play some shows.  Then a year later, they reconnected with their long-time buddy, songwriting icon [[Dean Dillon]].  Dean encouraged them to finish writing and recording an album that they had started together in 2016 with Dillon at the producing helm.  They went to Key West in early 2022 and wrote 7 songs in three days and then went into [[Ocean Way Recording|Ocean Way]] studios to record the songs in June of the same year.  After a year of putting finishing touches on those songs and the ones they had started in 2016, they were finally ready to press and release the album entitled UNBROKEN, which was released February 23, 2024 on Dillon's start-up label [[Unwound (song)|Unwound]] Records, whose namesake pays homage a song he wrote which would become [[George Strait]]'s first single on MCA Records in the early 1980s.
