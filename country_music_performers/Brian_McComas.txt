'''Brian McComas''' (born May 23, 1972) is an American [[country music]] artist. Originally signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]], and then [[Lyric Street Records]] in 2001, McComas charted two minor singles in 2001 and 2002. A year later, he charted the Top Ten single "[[99.9% Sure (I've Never Been Here Before)]]" on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. His eponymous debut album was also released that year. It produced an additional single before McComas was dropped from Lyric Street. He later signed to Katapult Records, which released his second album, ''Back Up Again'', in 2006.

==Biography==
McComas was born in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], and his family moved to [[Harrison, Arkansas]] when he was four years old. At age sixteen, he attended a [[Paul Overstreet]] concert; while at the concert, Overstreet gave McComas the address of his publishing company. McComas submitted a demo tape to the publishing company, who then encouraged him to continue working on his writing skills.<ref name="allmusic">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-mccomas-mn0000618766 Profile], Allmusic.com; accessed September 6, 2015.</ref><ref name="cmt">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040121034511/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/mccomas_brian/bio.jhtml McComas profile], cmt.com; accessed September 6, 2015.</ref>
