==Life and career==

{{BLP sources|date=August 2018}}
Gustafson was born June 7, 1961, near [[Conrad, Montana]],<ref name="Conrad">{{cite web |title=Yodeling Conrad cowboy inducted into MT Cowboy Hall of Fame |url=http://www.cutbankpioneerpress.com/cut_bank_pioneer_press/news/article_5fb8543a-ea2e-11e9-b4fe-735381b67563.html |website=Golden Triangle News |date=October 9, 2019 |access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref> the son of R.W. "Rib" Gustafson, a traditional folk/cowboy singer, retired large-animal veterinarian, and author. The elder Gustafson, who taught his son to sing and yodel, learned to yodel from Austrians on the ski team at Montana State College (now Montana State University), Bozeman, Montana.<ref name=Austrian/>  Among Rib's credits are two books (''Under the Chinook Arch'', ''Room to Roam'') about his life as a pioneering Montana veterinarian.

Wylie Gustafson founded his band, The Wild West Show, in 1988, in Los Angeles at the [[Palomino Club (North Hollywood)|Palomino Club]] where they were regulars on ''Ronnie Mack's Barn Dance''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehustle.co/the-yodeler-who-sued-yahoo/|title=The yodeler who sued Yahoo|date=April 20, 2019|website=The Hustle|language=en-US|access-date=April 27, 2020}}</ref> It was there that Gustafson showcased the first version of the Wild West Show which then included guitarist Will Ray. The group developed their sound alongside artists such as Dale Watson, Lucinda Williams, Dwight Yoakam, Rosie Flores and Dave Alvin.

Gustafson is particularly noted as a virtuoso [[yodeling|yodeler]], having originated the slow and ethereal High Plains Yodeling style. He also created and voiced the signature "Yahoo-oo-oo!" for [[Yahoo, Inc.]] He later sued Yahoo! for copyright infringement over the terms of the contract and use of his yodel. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crockett |first1=Zachary |title=The yodeler who sued Yahoo |url=https://thehustle.co/the-yodeler-who-sued-yahoo/ |website=The Hustle |access-date=April 23, 2019 |date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> His book and album, ''How to Yodel: Lessons to Tickle Your Tonsils'', was published by Gibbs Smith in 2007 and is the top selling publication on the rejuvenated vocal art. As of 2016, Gustafson remains one of the top choices of yodelers and his style can be heard frequently on national advertisements, television and movies. Some major companies that have used his yodel include Yahoo!, Walt Disney Films, Porsche, Mitsubishi, Miller Lite, Taco Bell and Montana Tourism.

In 1996, Gustafson (as himself) appeared on the [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' (episode "Freak Show").

Gustafson is also an accomplished horseman (2005 & 2008 [[National Cutting Horse Association|NCHA]] Western National Finals Top Ten Open Finalist) and cowboy. When not performing, he operates his Cross Three Quarter Horse Ranch near Conrad, Montana breeding, raising and training cow horses. When Gustafson was young, he was a competitive team roper. Sometimes when at home at his ranch, he participates in roping contests at local ranches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crossthreequarterhorses.com/|title=Cross Three Quarter Horses – Introduction to our ranch.|website=Cross Three Quarter Horses|language=en-US|access-date=April 30, 2017}}</ref> In 1998, he was a champion team roper at the Reba McEntire/Ben Johnson Celebrity Rodeo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wyliewebsite.com/press/biography/|title=Wylie's Biography {{!}} Wylie & the Wild West|work=Wylie & the Wild West|access-date=April 30, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

On April 25, 2007, "Montana Lullaby" was declared the official [[lullaby]] of Montana. A yodel by Gustafson was used to write the lullaby. As a result, Montana was the first state to have an official lullaby.<ref name=gustafson4>{{cite news|title=Montana's Lullaby |url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_e299c7cb-c2de-5703-9df3-8d3c89656e0d.html|newspaper=Billings Gazette|date=April 25, 2007|access-date=September 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=gustafson5>{{cite web|title=Montana Designates Nation's First Official Lullaby |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/montana_lullaby/song_cowboy/prweb522356.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201092811/http://www.prweb.com/releases/montana_lullaby/song_cowboy/prweb522356.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 1, 2013|publisher=PRWeb|date=April 27, 2007|access-date=September 5, 2011}}</ref>

In October 2019, Wylie was named as an inductee into the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame.<ref name=gustafson6>{{cite web|title=Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame announces 2019 inductions|url=https://montanacowboyfame.org/news--updates.html|publisher=Montana Living|date=October 1, 2019|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>
