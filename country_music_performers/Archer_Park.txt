==Biography==
Archer/Park consisted of songwriters and vocalists Randy Archer (born February 20, 1959, in [[Swainsboro, Georgia]]) and Johnny Park (born October 30, 1957, in [[Arlington, Texas]]).<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=26|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref> The two had success writing songs for other country music artists, and began working together in the same publishing company. As a result, they decided to form a duo and signed with [[Atlantic Records]]' Nashville branch in 1994. They recorded their debut album ''We Got a Lot in Common'' that same year.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/278541488/ | title=Archer/Park: Where there's 'Smoke', there's fire | publisher=Star-Gazette | date=September 29, 1994 | accessdate=May 31, 2022 | pages=5}}</ref> The album's two singles "Where There's Smoke" and "We Got a Lot in Common" both charted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]].<ref name="whitburn"/> The album received a mixed review from John P.
