'''Lennon & Maisy''' were a Canadian music duo composed of sisters [[Lennon Stella]] and [[Maisy Stella]]. They are best known for their roles as Maddie and Daphne Conrad in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] musical drama series ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'' (2012–2018). 

They were both born in [[Oshawa]], Ontario, but later resided in [[Nashville]]. They are the daughters of singer-songwriter duo MaryLynne and Brad Stella, who perform as [[the Stellas]].

==Early life==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2018}}
Lennon and Maisy Stella grew up on a secluded farm in [[Claremont, Ontario|Claremont]], Ontario. Born into a musical family, with both parents and other family members in the music business, the girls became interested in the business from a very early age.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bio |url=http://www.lennonandmaisy.com/ |access-date=2023-08-31 |website=Lennon and Maisy |language=en}}</ref> Lennon got her first guitar when she was five and was taught by her father, an experienced guitarist. Although neither of them has ever received lessons or professional vocal or instrumental training, they both play numerous instruments and sing in two-part harmony. Having both turned to music for entertainment, the girls wrote songs together in their early years and played at various shows and festivals alongside their parents’ duo the Stellas. The family moved to Nashville from Canada in 2009 so Brad and MaryLynne could further their music career. The family is currently residing in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]].

==Career==
Although music was the girls' early passion, Maisy had always been interested in acting and had been featured in several commercials and music videos when she was younger. So, when their mom became aware of a role in a new ABC show that was being filmed in Nashville, Maisy auditioned. At the final stages of the auditioning process, the casting agents learned of Maisy's older sister Lennon and decided that both girls would be cast on the show. Lennon and Maisy began starring in the ABC drama ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'' in October 2012. However, prior to appearing on ''Nashville'', the girls had to try to increase publicity so they could apply for their work visas. They achieved this and uploaded a cover of [[Robyn]]'s "[[Call Your Girlfriend]]," which went viral overnight. After this video was posted, they were invited to [[New York City]] to perform their cover on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Lennon & Maisy // "Call Your Girlfriend" // Robyn & Erato |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_aJHJdCHAo |access-date=2023-08-31 |language=en}}</ref> From that moment, their careers took off. Their [[YouTube]] channel now has over 97 million views and nearly 727,000 subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/lennonandmaisy|title=lennonandmaisy|website=YouTube}}</ref>

Lennon & Maisy performed [[The Lumineers]]' "[[Ho Hey]]" on [[Nashville (season 1)|season one]] of ''Nashville''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Nashville - Lennon and Maisy Stella (Maddie & Daphne) Sing Ho Hey |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiFD5NPLKjA |access-date=2023-08-31 |language=en}}</ref> Their version reached the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in April 2013. Later that year, Lennon & Maisy were invited to open for and present [[Taylor Swift]] with the Pinnacle Award at the [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA Awards]].

Early in 2014, they recorded the song "[[Love (Lennon & Maisy song)|Love]]" for a [[Coop (Switzerland)]] Naturaplan TV commercial.
