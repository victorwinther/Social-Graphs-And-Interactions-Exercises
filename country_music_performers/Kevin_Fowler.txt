'''Kevin Fowler''' (born May 11, 1966) is an American singer-songwriter. He has released five studio albums, and has charted four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the top 40 hit "Pound Sign (#?*!)". In addition, he wrote [[Sammy Kershaw]]'s 2003 single "Beer, Bait & Ammo", [[Mark Chesnutt]]'s 2004 single "The Lord Loves the Drinkin' Man" and [[Montgomery Gentry]]'s 2009 single "[[Long Line of Losers]]".

==Early life==
Fowler was born in [[Amarillo, Texas]], the younger of two children. His father introduced him to country music when he was a child, and as a teenager Fowler also developed a liking for rock music.<ref name="allmusic"/> He graduated in 1984 from [[Tascosa High School]] in Amarillo.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Long interested in making music, Fowler began piano lessons as a young child. When he was twenty, he realized that he wanted to seriously pursue a career in music and moved to Los Angeles, California, to attend the Guitar Institute of Technology. For the next year, he learned how to play the guitar and began writing songs.<ref name="allmusic"/>

After gaining a good knowledge of the guitar, Fowler left Los Angeles for [[Austin, Texas]]. He was a guitarist with the rock band ''[[Dangerous Toys]]'' in the early 1990s, but left to form his own [[Southern rock|Southern hard-rock]] band, ''Thunderfoot.'' In 1998, he left rock music all together to form a new band that would concentrate instead on Texas country music. Fowler and his new band earned themselves a weekly gig at Babe's on [[6th Street (Austin)|Sixth Street]] in Austin. Two years later, with no recording contracts, Fowler recorded and released his own debut album, ''[[Beer, Bait & Ammo]]''. This album sold over 30,000 copies in Texas, with the title track receiving a great deal of airplay. This song was popular enough that [[Mark Chesnutt]] began playing it in his live show, and [[Sammy Kershaw]] recorded it for one of his own albums.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web  | last = Birchmeier  | first = Jason  | title = Kevin Fowler Biography  | publisher = AllMusic  | url ={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p457811|pure_url=yes}} | access-date = March 16, 2007}}</ref>
