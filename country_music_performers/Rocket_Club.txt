==History==
The band's first national single, "One More Day," was written by Joel Sayles, Don Smithmier, and Twin Cities native Mark Lacek after Lacek's daughter died in the womb.<ref>Albertoni, Rich (2010) "[http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=28617 Onetime Madison rockers Rocket Club land on the country chart]", Isthmus, March 25, 2010. {{Retrieved|access-date=July 8, 2014}}</ref> The song got [[viral phenomenon|viral]] exposure via [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]], as well as airplay on Minneapolis radio station [[KEEY-FM]]. It is also included on a multi-artist album entitled ''Hope Rocks Volume II'', the benefits of which go to a [[nonprofit organization]] that Mark and his wife, Susan, founded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twincities.com/music/ci_13416044?nclick_check=1 |title=Father's ode to stillborn daughter now a song to comfort the grieving |author=Molly Guthrey Millett |date= 2009-10-09 |work=TwinCities.com |accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref> "One More Day" debuted on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts dated for the week of November 21, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1626280/carrie-underwood-has-the-weeks-top-album-and-song.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116180530/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1626280/carrie-underwood-has-the-weeks-top-album-and-song.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 16, 2009 |title=Carrie Underwood Has the Week's Top Album and Song |author=Edward Morris |date=2009-11-14 |work=CMT.com |accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref>

The band's second single, "One Thing Beautiful," written by Joel Sayles and Don Smithmier, spent 14 weeks on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts beginning July 12, 2010.

Rocket Club's debut self-titled CD was released in 2008. Their second record, ''American Serenade'', was released in October 2010.

In 2010, the band coined the term "North Country" to describe its more guitar oriented, non-Southern form of country music. They later turned the concept into a northern anthem with the release of their 3rd single, "North Country," which debuted on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] on June 14, 2011. An album of the same name was released in 2012.<ref>Gilbertson, Jon M.

The band released its fourth studio album on March 13, 2014, titled ''Lucky'' and produced by Joel Sayles.  The album was named after the project that created it. In 2013, the band completed a project dubbed "Lucky 13" in which it wrote, recorded and released one new song each month for a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocketclub.info/#news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222041237/http://www.rocketclub.info/#news |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |title=Rocket Club News |website=rocketclub.info |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>

After a nearly 8-year hiatus, the band released the single, “Easy,” in February 2022. This collaboration led to a full reunion and the release of their fifth album, “Come On Home” in 2023.
