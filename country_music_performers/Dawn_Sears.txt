'''Dawn Sears''' (born '''Dawn Marie Skari'''; December 7, 1961 – December 11, 2014) was an American [[country music]] singer. In addition to her work as a backing vocalist in [[Vince Gill]]'s band, she recorded four solo studio albums, of which two were released on major labels. She had one single that charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.

==Biography==
'''Dawn Marie Skari''' was born in [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota]]. She began her career in 1990 with the album ''What a Woman Wants to Hear'' on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album produced two minor singles. Because of her debut album's poor performance, Sears had decided to leave the country music scene. However, she later received a call from [[Vince Gill]], who had asked her to join his road band as a harmony vocalist. According to information provided by Thomas "Duke" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, Sears was also known for her song "Another Dream Away", which became a theme song for the newer "Bandit" movies starring Brian Bloom. The movies were a reissue to cash in on the "Smokey And The Bandit" franchise.<ref name="new">{{cite journal|date=July 1994|title=This Month's Music: Dawn Sears: "Runaway Train"|journal=New Country|volume=1|issue=5|page=6|issn=1074-536X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnsears.com/bio.html|title=Dawn Sears biography|accessdate=January 5, 2008|work=Dawn Sears.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819121612/http://www.dawnsears.com/bio.html|archivedate=August 19, 2007}}</ref>

In addition to singing harmony on Gill's 1992 album ''[[I Still Believe in You (album)|I Still Believe in You]]'', Sears provided duet vocals on the track "An Out of Control Raging Fire" on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s 1994 [[Tracy Byrd (album)|debut album]]. In 1994, she was signed as the first act on [[Decca Records]]' newly revived country music branch.<ref name="new"/> Her second album, 1994's ''Nothin' But Good'', was issued on Decca,<ref name="allmusic"/> and its lead-off single, "Runaway Train", entered the country music charts. Other singles from the album were unsuccessful, and Dawn exited Decca's roster not long afterward. A self-titled album was released independently in 2002, followed by her first Christmas album. Sears returned to her work as a backup vocalist for Gill.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p28122|pure_url=yes}}|title=Dawn Sears biography|accessdate=January 5, 2008|last=McCall|first=Michael|work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> She made appearances on several of Gill's albums, including his 2003 album ''[[Next Big Thing]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=237&issue=38|title=Next Big Thing – Vince Gill|accessdate=January 5, 2008|date=March 2003|work=Capital News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904200737/http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=237&issue=38|archive-date=September 4, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sears also performed with [[The Time Jumpers]].
