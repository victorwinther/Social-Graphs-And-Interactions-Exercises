I hate people telling me what to do with my music and stuff. They used to tell me to sing all this Natalie Imbruglia stuff so I quit them. I had guitar lessons from the same guy and he taught me the basic chords and I gave that up once I knew all the basic chords, thinking that will do me."<ref name="Morris"/>

Her first effort at song writing, "Guardian Angel", occurred when she was 11, she later recalled, "it was pretty bad".<ref name="Morris"/> In the following year her parents took her to meet Australian country musician, Bill Chambers, who invited Britt on stage to duet on "T.

Britt attended the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]], held in Tamworth, in January 2003 and told [[Debbie Kruger]] of [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) of her writing process for the album, "The way I write songs is a bit strange ...
