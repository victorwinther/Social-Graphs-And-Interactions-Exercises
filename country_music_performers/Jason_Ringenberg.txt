Ringenberg has also seen success as a solo artist. He has released five solo records and toured as a solo artist. ''The Times'' (London) called him "one of the most exciting performers of his generation." He now performs both solo as Jason Ringenberg and as his children's music character, Farmer Jason, often performing as both personas in the same day.

Ringenberg created his children's music character, Farmer Jason, in 2002 to entertain his own daughters.<ref name= school /> He then released his first children's record on the [[Yep Roc Records]] label; ''A Day at the Farm with Farmer Jason'', in 2003.<ref name=jurek /> The character remains popular and has become the most successful project of his career. As Farmer Jason, he sings songs about farm animals and the appreciation of nature. His [[PBS]] mini program called "It's a Farmer Jason" has earned four Emmy nominations and one Emmy win. He has recorded four records and a DVD as Farmer Jason. The fourth album, ''Christmas on the Farm with Farmer Jason'', was released in December 2014.<ref name= indyweek />

His album ''Stand Tall'' (2019) was written while he was Artist in Residence at Sequoia National Park. Recorded at his old college haunts in Southern Illinois and also in Nashville, the subjects of the songs range from John the Baptist to The Ramones to a disillusioned Confederate draftee.

==Personal life==
Ringenberg lives near [[Bon Aqua, Tennessee]], with his wife Suzy; daughters Kelsey, Addie, and Camille; and a barnyard full of animals. <ref name="school" />
