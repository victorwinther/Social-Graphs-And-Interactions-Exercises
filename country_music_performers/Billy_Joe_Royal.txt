==Life and career==
[[File:Billy Joe Royal.png|200px|thumb|left|Royal in 1966]]
Born in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], to Clarence and Mary Sue Smith Royal, and raised in [[Marietta, Georgia]], Royal performed at the Georgia Jubilee in Atlanta during his teens. He formed his own [[rock and roll]] band, and became a local [[celebrity|star]] at the Bamboo Ranch in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where his singing style was influenced by African-American performers, including [[Sam Cooke]].<ref name=allmusic/>
Royal was a friend of performer and [[songwriter]]  [[Joe South]], and recorded what was intended as a [[demo (music)|demo]] of South's song "[[Down in the Boondocks (song)|Down in the Boondocks]]". The recording was heard at [[Columbia Records]], who offered Royal a singing contract in 1965 and released his version of the song, produced by South.<ref name=allmusic/> "Down in the Boondocks" remained his best-known song, reaching number 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicvf.com/song.php?id=4964|title=Down in the Boondocks (song by Billy Joe Royal) ••• Music VF, US & UK hits charts|website=Musicvf.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref> and number 38 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/12029/billy-joe-royal/|title=BILLY JOE ROYAL &#124; full Official Chart History|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref>

He followed up his initial success with the [[single (music)|singles]] "[[I Knew You When (Billy Joe Royal song)|I Knew You When]]" (Top 20, 1965) and "[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]" (1967), also written and produced by Joe South.  Another South composition, "[[Yo-Yo (Billy Joe Royal song)|Yo-Yo]]", just missed the top 40 in Canada and charted poorly in the U.S. when Royal released it in 1967, but a later remake by [[The Osmonds]] was a much greater success.  His 1969 single, "[[Cherry Hill Park]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=billyjoeroyal.com>{{cite web|title=Billy Joe Royal|url=http://billyjoeroyal.com/|publisher=Billyjoeroyal.com/|access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref>  In the 1970s his recording of "Heart's Desire" gained popularity among [[Northern soul]] enthusiasts and was regularly played in Northern soul nightclubs.<ref name="TooDarnSoulful">{{cite book | title=Too Darn Soulful – The Story of Northern Soul | publisher=Robson Books | author=Nowell, David | year=1999 | location=London | pages=118 | isbn=1-86105-270-7}}</ref>

By the late 1970s, Royal had become a regular performer in [[Las Vegas]], and also appeared as an actor in movies and on television.  His last hit on the US pop charts was in 1978, when his version of "[[Under the Boardwalk]]" became a minor hit.  However, he reinvented himself in the 1980s as a mainstream [[country music|country]] star, and had his first hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] in 1985 with "[[Burned Like a Rocket]]", released on the [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] label.  His other country hits included "[[I'll Pin a Note on Your Pillow]]" (1987), "[[Tell It Like It Is (song)|Tell It Like It Is]]", and "[[Till I Can't Take It Anymore]]" (both 1989).  His successes on the country charts continued until the early 1990s.<ref name=allmusic/>

Royal experienced a second comeback during the 2000s due to regular airplay on Country and Classic radio stations.  His music was further exposed to younger generations through a movement known as [[The Beat Army]], an online music forum based on Facebook which is operated by author and music producer [[Paul Collins (musician)|Paul Collins]].  Royal continued to tour regularly, performing concerts at casinos, music festivals, and clubs in North America, Japan, and throughout Europe.  His set lists included a mixture of songs representing multiple genres from the 1960s onwards.  He also played Robert Ally in the [[Indie film|indie]] Western film, ''Billy the Kid'' (2013), co-starring country singer [[Confederate Railroad|Cody McCarver]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Forbesfilms.com|title=Billy the Kid|url=http://forbesfilms.com|work=A Cold Day in Hell|access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2935888/ |title=''Billy the Kid'' (2013)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=August 24, 2013}}</ref>
