'''Scooter Lee''' (born March 10, 1957) is an American singer-songwriter & line dance entertainer. Raised on St. Charles Avenue in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Scooter Lee loves giving line dance instructions to senior citizens|url=https://linedanceinstructions2.wordpress.com/|website=Line Dance Instructions|accessdate=4 April 2015|date=August 22, 2009}}</ref> her career started at age 14 when she was signed to [[Allen Toussaint|Allen Toussaint's]] record label in New Orleans, recording with [[Irma Thomas]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Fats Domino]]. There, she was labeled as 'the little lady with the big voice'; recording country blues for the label. She soon settled in on recording country music with a blues overtone.

During the 1970s, Scooter Lee toured alongside major artists, including [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Johnny Cash|Johnny]] & [[June Carter Cash]]. In the 1980s, Scooter Lee gained ground with her 5 piece band sponsored by the [[RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company]], working 10 months a year at every major state fair and other regional festivals. Performing 2-3 shows daily, 300 dates a year, taught her the art of fully commanding a stage. Spotted in Los Angeles in 1985, Scooter Lee was invited to join the [[Bob Hope]] [[United Service Organizations|USO Tours]] and gained experience on stages in war-torn countries.

Scooter Lee grabbed the attention of the country music dance community during the early 1990s when she was signed to [[Sony Records]] to follow in the footsteps of [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Tracy Byrd]] and [[Reba McEntire]] just as the '[[line dance]]' phenomenon emerged. She developed and perfected the formula of writing & recording a perfectly phrased song that was not only 'dancer friendly' but 'radio friendly' as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scooter Lee Biography|url=http://stompede.com/scooter_lee.html|website=Sundance Stompede|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> Some of her most successful singles include J'ai du Boogie, Dizzy, Rose Garden, High-Test Love, Ribbon Of Highway, Roll Back The Rug, Honky Tonk Twist, OeeOeeO, Rock & Roll Waltz, Rompin' Stompin', Louisiana Hot Sauce, This Little Light Of Mine, Splish Splash and Break Away.
