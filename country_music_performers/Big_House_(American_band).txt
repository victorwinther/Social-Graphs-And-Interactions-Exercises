'''Big House''' is an American [[country music]] band based in [[Bakersfield, California]]. Grounded in the [[Bakersfield Sound]], originally, the band consisted of [[Monty Byrom]] ([[lead vocals]], [[guitar]]), David Neuhauser ([[guitar]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]), Chuck Seaton ([[guitar]]), Tanner Byrom ([[drums]]), Sonny California ([[harmonica]]), and Ron Mitchell ([[bass guitar]]). Under this lineup, Big House recorded two albums for [[MCA Nashville]]: 1997's ''Big House'' and 1998's ''Travelin' Kind''. These two albums produced four chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, including the No.&nbsp;30 hit "Cold Outside."

After the release of their second album, all of the band's members departed except for Monty Byrom and David Neuhauser. Benny Rappa was then signed as the band's new drummer, and Steve Vines assumed the role of bass guitarist. The revamped lineup recorded one album for [[Dead Reckoning Records]] before disbanding in 2000.  The six original members reunited for concerts in 2007 and 2008, and released a fourth album in 2008 ''Never Ending Train.''

==Biography==
Although its six members (all natives of [[Bakersfield, California]]) had all performed together in various lineups, Big House was not officially formed until 1995, when brothers Monty and Tanner Byrom first performed with four other musicians at a venue in [[Oildale, California]].<ref name="pollstar">{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewhotstar.pl?Artist=BIGHOU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020423023926/http://pollstar.com/news/viewhotstar.pl?Artist=BIGHOU |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-04-23 |title=Big House |accessdate=2007-12-30 |date=1997-06-02 |work=Pollstar}} </ref><ref name="played"/> After realizing that they all seemed to work well together, the six musicians decided to form a band.

==Major-label debut==
Throughout the 1990s, Big House played throughout their native state of California. They had also tried to make themselves known in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Big House was not well received by Nashville until Neuhauser suggested that the band submit a demo tape to [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], president of [[MCA Nashville Records]].<ref name="pollstar"/> A demo tape was sent to the label, and by 1997, the re-tooled demo tape was issued as the band's debut album, also titled ''Big House''.<ref name="pollstar"/><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p202315|pure_url=yes}} |title=Big House biography |accessdate=2007-12-30 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name="afire">{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/static/FP/baksound/house.htm |title=Like a House Afire |accessdate=2007-12-30 |last=Price |first=Robert |work=The Bakersfield Californian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019041715/http://www.bakersfield.com/static/FP/baksound/house.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2006 }}</ref> Three of the album's singles entered the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including "Cold Outside", which peaked at No.&nbsp;30.<ref name="played"/> A second album, entitled ''Travelin' Kind'', followed one year later; its lone single, "Faith", peaked at No.&nbsp;63.

In 1998, the [[Academy of Country Music]] nominated Big House for the Top New Vocal Group or Duo award, alongside [[The Kinleys]] and [[The Lynns]], losing to The Kinleys.

==Membership changes and disbanding==
After the release of their second album, however, most of Big House's members parted ways; Tanner Byrom, Ron Mitchell and Chuck Seaton returned home and joined with Billy Russell to form the band "Hot Taco".

The four-piece lineup recorded one album, ''Woodstock Nation'', which was issued in 2000 on [[Dead Reckoning Records]], an independent label owned by songwriters [[Kieran Kane]] and [[Kevin Welch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1478102/20030911/big_house_country_.jhtml |title=Western Beat Welcomes Bakersfield Rockers |accessdate=2007-12-30 |date=2000-08-12 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Big House disbanded shortly afterward.
