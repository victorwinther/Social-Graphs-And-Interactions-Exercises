==Career==
Zane Williams is an anomaly in today's country music scene, a modern-day “throwback” who is equal parts bar-room entertainer and introspective poet.  Williams was a finalist in three categories at [[MerleFest]]'s Chris Austin Song Contest, claiming top slots in both the Country and General categories. "Hurry Home" was also selected as the $20,000 Maxell Song of the Year in the [[John Lennon Songwriting Contest]].<ref>[http://www.jlsc.com/winners/2005b/lennon_awards.php John Lennon Song Contest website Page for 2005 winners]. In 2006, Zane won Best Folk Award at the 2nd Annual IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards) with his song "Hurry Home".

Williams has received radio airplay on country stations across Texas that led to his first entry on the Texas Music Chart with "Ride With Me", from the 2011 album with the same title.
