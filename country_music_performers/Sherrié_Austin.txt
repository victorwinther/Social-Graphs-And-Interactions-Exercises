Active as a singer since her teenage years, Austin initially recorded as one half of the duo '''Colourhaus''', which also featured Phil Radford. After leaving Colourhaus, she moved to the United States in pursuit of a solo career. There, she recorded five studio albums, and charted several singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Her highest charting single was the No.&nbsp;18 "[[Streets of Heaven (song)|Streets of Heaven]]" in 2003. Her most recent album was released on 15 November 2011.

==Career==
===Early career===
Austin got her start in music opening for [[Johnny Cash]] in Australia at the age of 14. She later moved to the United States where she took up acting. She is most known in the United States for playing the role of Pippa McKenna on ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' during its final season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monagiza.com/stories/now-facts-life-cast/|title=Where are they now? The Facts of Life cast|website=Monagiza.com|first=Nicole|last=West|date=21 November 2017}}</ref>

In 1991, she appeared as "Lady Penelope" on episode No.&nbsp;20 of the first season of the television comedy series ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epguides.com/freshprinceofbelair/guide.shtml|title=The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (an Episode Guide)|website=EpGuides.com|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref> In the 1990s, she started a singing career, teaming up with Phil Radford in 1992, to form a duo, '''Colourhaus''', which released one album, ''Water to the Soul''.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p210972/biography|pure_url=yes}} Sherrié Austin | Biography, Albums, Streaming Links | AllMusic]</ref> The song "Innocent Child" taken from that album was issued as a single, with "We Talk to the Angels" on the B-side, and it peaked at No. 50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="Whitburn 2013 556">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2013|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2012|edition=14th|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn= 978-0-89820-205-2|page=185}}</ref> The Colourhaus song "Colour Me You" was on the soundtrack of the "Rookie of the Year" episode of the television series ''[[Baywatch]]'' on 5 October 1992.

===Nashville move===
Afterwards, Austin moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a career in country music. Her first solo contract was with [[Arista Nashville]], with the album ''[[Words (Sherrié Austin album)|Words]]'' being released in 1997. It produced singles in "Lucky in Love", "One Solitary Tear", "Put Your Heart into It", and "Innocent Man". "Lucky in Love" and "Put Your Heart into It" both reached Top 40 on the country charts with a peak of No.&nbsp;34 each.

Her second and final album for Arista was 1999's ''[[Love in the Real World]]'', led off by the No.&nbsp;29 "Never Been Kissed", which was followed by "Little Bird". After RCA acquired Arista Records, Austin's publishing company, Reynsong Publishing, formed Wrensong Entertainment and signed to [[Madacy Entertainment]] for her next album, ''[[Followin' a Feelin']]'', which produced another single in its lead-off single, a cover of [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]".

Later, she switched to the independent [[Broken Bow Records]] label. Her fourth album of country music, titled ''[[Streets of Heaven (album)|Streets of Heaven]]'', produced her biggest country hit in its [[Streets of Heaven (song)|title track]]. Following this single was "[[Son of a Preacher Man]]", a cover of the [[Dusty Springfield]] song, which was never included on an album.

===Broadway years===
Austin moved to New York City in 2005 and appeared in the New York Musical Theater Festival's production of ''Bonnie & Clyde''. ''The New York Times'' commented that she was "a sultry young country music singer who plays the notorious criminal Bonnie Parker and does for this musical what [[Reba McEntire]] did for the 1999 revival of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]].'' That twang in her voice provides some much-needed authenticity in excellent pop-country numbers like "Ain't Goin' Back." And it's easy to tell by her hip-swiveling poses that this is a woman who knows how to hold a stage."<ref>{{cite news |last=Zinoman |first=Jason |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E1D61730F930A1575AC0A9639C8B63 |title=NEW YORK MUSICAL THEATER FESTIVAL REVIEWS – The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde – Review – NYTimes.com |newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 September 2005 |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref>

===''Circus Girl'' (2011)===
Austin's most recent album, ''Circus Girl'', her first in eight years, is described as a series of stories interpreted by a strong woman, about women, and for women. Austin feels it's something her female fans have been clamouring for, for quite some time.<ref name="SherrieAustinMusic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherrieaustinmusic.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=96&Itemid=219|title=Official Artist Website for Singer, Songwriter and Actress Sherrie Austin|website=SherrieAustinMusic.com|access-date=29 July 2017|archive-date=30 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730013410/http://www.sherrieaustinmusic.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=96&Itemid=219|url-status=dead}}</ref>

"The last few years I had been complaining about that fact that there weren’t any females speaking to women above the age of 30, so I started thinking about how I was writing my songs and came up with the idea for "Friday Night Girls"... I wanted to write a three-minute song with every ''[[Sex and the City]]'' episode that had ever existed, so I did. I quickly noticed that the women in my audiences loved it and so I switched my songwriting focus for a while to concentrate on that audience, who are my peers, to speak to them", says Austin.<ref name="SherrieAustinMusic.com" />

''Circus Girl'' was released independently on 15 November 2011.
