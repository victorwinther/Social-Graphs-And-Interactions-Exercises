'''Mark Nesler''' (born January 5, 1961, in [[Beaumont, Texas]]) is an American [[country music]] artist. Signed to [[Elektra Records]] as a recording artist in 1998, Nesler charted three singles on the U.S. ''Billboard'' country charts. In addition, he has written several singles for other country music artists, including [[Tim McGraw]]'s "[[Just to See You Smile]]", a song which ''Billboard'' ranked as the number one country single of 1998.

==Biography==
Nesler played guitar at an early age. Inspired by the [[bluegrass music]] his father listened to, he soon learned to play [[banjo]] as well. After graduating high school, he played in a band called the Two Dollar Pistols.<ref name="allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p294574/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Mark Nesler > Biography )))]</ref> In 1994, he was signed to a songwriting deal with [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Publishing]], and soon joined [[Tracy Byrd]]'s touring band.<ref name="allmusic"/> Byrd also recorded and released "[[Heaven in My Woman's Eyes]]", which Nesler wrote, as a single in 1996.

In 1998, Nesler scored his first number one as a songwriter, when [[Tim McGraw]] spent six weeks at Number One on the ''Billboard'' country music charts with "[[Just to See You Smile]]".<ref>[http://countrymusic.about.com/library/bltimmcgrawdisco.htm Tim McGraw Discography at About.com]</ref> The same year, Nesler's first album was released on [[Asylum Records]]. Its leadoff single, "Used to the Pain", peaked at No.&nbsp;47 on the country charts. The album also produced his highest-charting single in "Slow Down" at No.&nbsp;46, followed by "Baby Ain't Rockin' Me Right" at No.&nbsp;62. He also co-wrote [[Aaron Tippin]]'s late-1998 single "[[For You I Will (Aaron Tippin song)|For You I Will]]".

Although he exited Elektra in 1999, Nesler continued to write for Byrd, who released "Take Me with You When You Go" and "[[Just Let Me Be in Love]]" in 2000 and 2002 respectively. [[George Strait]] recorded two of his songs: "[[Go On (George Strait song)|Go On]]"; and "[[Living and Living Well]]" which was a No.&nbsp;1 single. In 2005, [[Tracy Lawrence]] reached No.&nbsp;35 on the country charts with a cover of "Used to the Pain". Nesler co-wrote [[Bucky Covington]]'s 2007 debut single "[[A Different World (song)|A Different World]]", while Nesler's other credits included "[[Why, Why, Why]]" and “Let Me Down Easy” by [[Billy Currington]] and another number one with [[Keith Urban]]'s 2008 single "[[You Look Good in My Shirt]]", along with Josh Turner’s “Time Is Love”, Billboard’s 2012 most played song of the year.

Nesler is an ex-husband of singer-songwriter [[Jennifer Hanson]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://songtown.com/on-songwriting/5-days-built-songwriting-career/ | title=5 Days Built a Songwriting Career - Songtown | date=March 23, 2017 }}</ref>
