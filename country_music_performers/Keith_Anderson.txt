'''Keith Anderson''' (born January 12, 1968) is an American [[country music]] singer. Before signing to a record deal, Anderson was one of several co-writers on "Beer Run (B Double E Double R-U-N)", a duet by [[Garth Brooks]] and [[George Jones]], released in late 2001. Anderson was signed as a recording artist to [[Arista Nashville]] in 2004. His debut single "[[Pickin' Wildflowers]]" was released that year, as the lead-off track from his debut album ''[[Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll]]''. Counting "Pickin' Wildflowers", the album produced a total of four hit singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

In addition to his own material, Anderson co-wrote [[Big & Rich]]'s single "[[Lost in This Moment]]", a Number One hit on the country music charts in mid-2007. Anderson switched to the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] label in 2007, and his second album, ''[[C'mon! (Keith Anderson album)|C'mon!]]'', was released on August 5, 2008. The second single from the album, "[[I Still Miss You]]", became his first Top 5 country hit.

His latest release is a six-song EP album titled ''I'll Bring the Music''; it was released May 12, 2015.

During his college career, he obtained a degree in engineering.<ref name="TCC">{{cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/keithanderson/a/blkanderson_bio.htm|title=Keith Anderson Bio – Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll|last=Fabian|first=Shelly|publisher=About|access-date=September 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022065656/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/keithanderson/a/blkanderson_bio.htm|archive-date=October 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also played baseball during his college years, and was approached by the [[Kansas City Royals]].<ref name="bio" /> After a shoulder injury ended his pursuit of a professional baseball career, Anderson tried bodybuilding and placed second in the Mr. Oklahoma competition.<ref name="bio" />

== Career ==
After graduating, he accepted a position with an engineering firm in [[Dallas]], Texas. A year and a half later, he resigned to pursue a career in music. He attended clubs at night, began writing songs, and began learning guitar from his brother, Brian.

In Dallas, he auditioned for ''Grapevine Opry'', a show that had produced other country stars in the past. He performed on the show for three years, before performing at the [[Texas State Fair]] and [[Six Flags]].

Due to financial difficulties, he was forced to find additional work, as a [[landscaper]] and as a [[personal trainer]].<ref name="TCC" /> He also enrolled in the [[physical therapy]] program at [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].<ref name="TCC" /> One month before starting, he decided to put his education on hold, and began producing his first CD. He said, "The month before I started, I thought, 'Wait a minute. This is going to be a whole bunch of commitment. If I'm ever going to do music, I need to go for it 100%. NOW. Physical therapy will always be there, and my engineering degree will always be there.'"<ref name="TCC" />

After recording his CD in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], he began marketing it to radio stations.<ref name="TCC" /> In 2000, he put together a band. His first hit as a songwriter came in 2001, when [[Garth Brooks]] and [[George Jones]] recorded "Beer Run (B Double E R-U-N)", which Anderson co-wrote with several other writers, including [[George Ducas (singer)|George Ducas]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p691984|pure_url=yes}} |title=Keith Anderson biography |access-date=September 19, 2008 |last=Jeffries |first=David |work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref name="salina">{{cite web|url=http://www.saljournal.com/rdencore/story/Keith-Anderson-4-25|title=Keith Anderson trades baseball dreams for country glory.|publisher=Salina|access-date=September 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927153835/http://www.saljournal.com/rdencore/story/Keith-Anderson-4-25|archive-date=September 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> He opened for [[Montgomery Gentry]] in 2002, and performed at many events, where he earned his recording deal with [[Arista Nashville]].
