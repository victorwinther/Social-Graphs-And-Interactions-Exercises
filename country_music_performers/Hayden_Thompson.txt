'''Hayden Thompson''' (born March 5, 1938) is an American singer, songwriter, and [[rockabilly]] musician.<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|page=442}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/HaydenThompson1.html |title=Hayden Thompson |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-02 |archive-date=October 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020062502/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/HaydenThompson1.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Thompson was born in [[Booneville, Mississippi]], United States.<ref name="Larkin50"/> At high school Thompson formed the Southern Melody Boys, who made a recording which led from a radio session. "I Feel the Blues Coming On" was sung by Thompson and gave them another radio appearance on the "[[Louisiana Hayride]]" show. Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  "Love My Baby" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Thompson's recording of "$16.88" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name="Larkin50"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades. These included ''The Time Is Now'' (1990).<ref name="Larkin50"/>
