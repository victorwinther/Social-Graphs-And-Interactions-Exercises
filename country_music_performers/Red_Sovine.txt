'''Woodrow Wilson''' "'''Red'''" '''Sovine''' (July 7, 1917 – April 4, 1980) was an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter associated with [[truck-driving country]] songs, particularly those recited as narratives but set to music.<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|page=412}}</ref> His most noted examples are "[[Giddyup Go]]" (1965) and "[[Teddy Bear (Red Sovine song)|Teddy Bear]]" (1976), both of which topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart.

== Biography ==
Sovine was born in 1917 in [[Charleston, West Virginia]],<ref name="Larkin50" /> earning the nickname "Red" because of his reddish-brown hair. He had two brothers and two sisters. Sovine was taught to play guitar by his mother. His first venture into music was with his childhood friend Johnnie Bailes, with whom he performed as "Smiley and Red, the Singing Sailors" in the country music revue Jim Pike's Carolina Tar Heels on [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA-AM]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]].<ref name="All Music">{{cite web

}}</ref> Faced with limited success, Bailes left to perform as part of The Bailes Brothers. Sovine got married, and continued to sing on Charleston radio, while holding down a job as a supervisor of a hosiery factory.<ref name="All Music" /> With the encouragement of Bailes, Sovine formed The Echo Valley Boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redsovine.com/redsovinebio.html |title=Red Sovine Bio |website=Redsovine.com |access-date=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234224/http://www.redsovine.com/redsovinebio.html |archive-date=July 22, 2011}}</ref>

== Career ==
After a year of performing in [[West Virginia]], Sovine moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], where the Bailes Brothers were performing on [[KWKH]]-AM. Sovine's own early morning show was not popular, but he gained greater exposure performing on the famed KWKH radio program, ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''.<ref name="Larkin50" /> One of his co-stars was [[Hank Williams]], who steered Sovine toward a better time slot at [[WSFA]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], and toward a contract with [[MGM Records]] in 1949. That same year, Sovine replaced Williams on ''Louisiana Hayride'' when Williams jumped to the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name="All Music" />

Another ''Louisiana Hayride'' co-star who helped Sovine was country music legend [[Webb Pierce]], who convinced Sovine to lead his Wondering Boys band and helped him toward a contract with [[Decca Records|Decca]] in 1954. The following year Sovine cut a duet with [[Goldie Hill]], "Are You Mine?" which peaked in the Top 15, and in 1956 he had his first number one hit when he duetted with Pierce on a cover of [[George Jones]]' "[[Why Baby Why]]".<ref name="Larkin50" /> Sovine had two other Top Five singles that year and became a member of the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name="All Music" /><ref>{{cite web| title = Opry Timeline – 1950s| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html| website = Opry.com| access-date = July 10, 2012| archive-date = March 30, 2019| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190330032424/https://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html| url-status = dead}}</ref> After recording close to 50 sides with Decca by 1959, Sovine signed to [[Starday Records]] and began touring the club circuit as a solo act. That same year, Sovine was seriously injured in a car accident that claimed the lives of two of his band members, Douglas Nicks and Johnny Morris.

=== 1960s ===
In 1961, a song copyrighted in 1955 by Sovine and co-writer Dale Noe became a sizeable hit on the pop chart. The tune was the ballad "[[Missing You (Red Sovine song)|Missing You]]", arranged in Countrypolitan style and was recorded by [[Ray Peterson]] for his own Dunes label. "Missing You" became a No. 29 [[Billboard 200|Billboard]] "Top 100" hit. In the fall, it peaked at No. 7 on Billboard's "Adult Contemporary" chart. In 1963, Sovine passed on the helping hand given him by older performers when he heard the singing of [[minor league baseball]] player [[Charley Pride]] and suggested that he move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Sovine opened doors for Pride at Pierce's Cedarwood Publishing, but his own career had stalled: "Dream House For Sale", which reached number 22 in 1964, came nearly eight years after his last hit.<ref name="All Music" />

=== Truck-driving songs ===
In 1965, Sovine found his niche when he recorded "[[Giddyup Go]]", which, like most of his other trucker hits, he co-wrote with Tommy Hill.<ref name="Larkin50" /> It is spoken, rather than sung, as the words of an older long-distance truck driver who rediscovers his long-lost son driving another truck on the same highway. [[Minnie Pearl]] released an answer song titled "Giddy-Up Go Answer". Sovine's version of the song spent six weeks atop the country charts. Other truck-driving country hits followed, including;

* "[[Phantom 309]]", a tale of a hitchhiker who hops a ride from a trucker who turns out to be the ghost of a man who died years ago giving his life to save a school bus full of children from a horrible collision with his rig. This story was later adapted by singer-songwriter [[Tom Waits]], who performed "Big Joe And Phantom 309" during his Nighthawks At The Diner recordings. Waits' version of this song was covered by [[Archers of Loaf]] on the 1995 tribute album, ''[[Step Right Up: The Songs of Tom Waits]]''. Musician [[Steve Flett]] named a recording project after the song. The song was originally written and recorded by [[Tommy Faile]].
* "[[Teddy Bear (Red Sovine song)|Teddy Bear]]", the tale of a disabled boy who lost his truck driver father in a highway accident and keeps his CB radio base as his only companion.
* "Little Joe", a tale of a trucker and his devoted canine friend which became his last hit. This last story features the Teddy Bear character, who can now walk.<ref name="All Music" />

== Personal life and death ==
Sovine was married to Norma Searls, who died on June 4, 1976, at the age of 57.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mrs. Norma Sovine |newspaper=[[Charleston Gazette-Mail|Sunday Gazette-Mail]] |page=56 |location=Charleston, West Virginia |date=June 6, 1976 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17607513/norma-searls-sovine-obituary/ |access-date=May 5, 2021}}</ref>

On April 4, 1980, Sovine suffered a heart attack while driving in southern Nashville, causing him to run a red light and strike an oncoming vehicle. He and the other driver, 25-year-old Edgar Primm, were transported to St. Thomas Hospital. While Primm was treated and released for minor facial injuries, Sovine died shortly after arrival. According to a preliminary autopsy, Sovine sustained massive abdominal bleeding caused by a lacerated spleen and liver, and fractured ribs and sternum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/03/we-miss-you-red-sovine-mp3.html|title=We Miss You Red Sovine (MP3) – WFMU's Beware of the Blog|website=Blog.wfmu.org|access-date=April 13, 2018}}</ref>{{better source needed|reason=blog|date=October 2021}}
