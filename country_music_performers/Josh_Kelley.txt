His younger brother, [[Charles Kelley]], is a musician and singer in the country trio [[Lady A]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/lady-antebellum-singer-charles-kelley-gets-engaged |title=Lady Antebellum Singer Charles Kelley Gets Engaged |last=Abrahamson |first=Rachel Paula |magazine=US Magazine |date=December 26, 2008 |access-date=December 26, 2008 |archive-date=December 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227090311/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/lady-antebellum-singer-charles-kelley-gets-engaged |url-status=dead}} US Magazine, December 26, 2008</ref> When he was a teenager, Kelley and his brother Charles formed a band called Inside Blue.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} By the time he was 14, the band released a CD with five songs on it, which led to a meeting with [[James Brown]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Kelley played the guitar in the high school jazz band alongside Charles (drums) and Dave Haywood (guitar) from Lady A.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Kelley attended the [[University of Mississippi]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], and is a member of the [[Kappa Sigma Fraternity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Music career==
Kelley released his [[independent record label|independent]] album, ''Changing Faces'', in 2001 and signed with [[Hollywood Records]] in 2002. Working with [[John Alagia]] as his record producer, Kelley released the album, ''[[For the Ride Home]]'', on June 3, 2003.

Even though Kelley has stated that the lyrics from his song "Angeles" were fabricated, he moved to Los Angeles from Georgia and recorded the majority of his second album, ''[[Almost Honest (album)|Almost Honest]]'', in the studio of his home.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} ''Almost Honest'' was released on August 23, 2005, and featured the hit single, "[[Only You (Josh Kelley song)|Only You]]."{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In November 2009, Kelley signed with [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] and began recording his first country album in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1626685/singer-songwriter-josh-kelley-signs-nashville-record-deal.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122063603/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1626685/singer-songwriter-josh-kelley-signs-nashville-record-deal.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 22, 2009|title=Singer-Songwriter Josh Kelley Signs Nashville Record Deal}}</ref> The album's first single, "[[Georgia Clay (song)|Georgia Clay]]", was released to country radio in August 2010.

One year later, in June 2006, they became engaged.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1205213,00.html?cid=redirect-articles | title=Grey's Anatomy Star Katherine Heigl Engaged | date=June 16, 2006 | work=[[People (magazine)|People]] | access-date=September 17, 2007}}</ref> He wrote the song "Hey Katie" for Heigl.
