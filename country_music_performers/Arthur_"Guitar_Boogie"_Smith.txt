}}</ref> The song earned him the moniker '''Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith''' (to differentiate him from Tennessee fiddler and 1930s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' star [[Fiddlin' Arthur Smith]]). It was recorded by numerous other musicians, including [[Tommy Emmanuel]], and became known around the world.

Renamed "Guitar Boogie Shuffle", it became a [[rock and roll]] hit by [[The Virtues (band)|Frank Virtue and the Virtues]]. Virtue served in the Navy with Smith and counted him as a major influence. Other musicians who have been influenced by Smith include [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] studio ace [[Hank Garland|Hank "Sugarfoot" Garland]], [[Roy Clark]], and [[Glen Campbell]].<ref name="obit"/>

Smith was also noted for his "Feudin' Banjos" (1955), which was also recorded by [[Lester Flatt]]. It was revived as "[[Dueling Banjos]]" and used as a theme song in the popular film, ''[[Deliverance]]'' (1972). Released as a single, it became a hit, played on Top 40, AOR, and country stations alike. It reached the Top Ten and hit #1 in the US and Canada.<ref name="bluegrass">{{cite web|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/arthur-smith-passes/ |title=Arthur Smith passes |publisher=Bluegrass Today |date=2014-04-04 |access-date=2015-08-28}}</ref> Because he was not credited in the film for the song, Smith sued [[Warner Brothers]], and gained a settlement.<ref name="obit">{{cite web |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/04/03/4815965/charlottes-arthur-smith-who-wrote.html#.U_4NOWOOpX0 |title=Charlotte's Arthur Smith, who wrote 'Dueling Banjos,' died Thursday at 93 |publisher=The Charlotte Observer |date=2014-04-03 |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065247/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/04/03/4815965/charlottes-arthur-smith-who-wrote.html#.U_4NOWOOpX0 |archive-date=April 7, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Smith asked Warner Bros. to include his name on the official soundtrack listing, but reportedly asked to be omitted from the film credits because he found the film offensive.<ref name="obit2">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/arthur-guitar-boogie-smith-country-musician-dies-at-93/2014/04/06/5b080978-bc3d-11e3-9c3c-311301e2167d_story.html|title=Arthur Smith, guitarist who wrote 'Guitar Boogie' and 'Duelin' Banjos,' dies at 93|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2014-04-06 |access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>

==Early life==
Arthur Smith was born in 1921 in Clinton, South Carolina, the son of Clayton Seymour Smith, a cotton mill worker, and his wife. His father was also a music teacher, and led a brass band in [[Kershaw, South Carolina]].<ref name="obit"/> The boy's first instrument was the [[cornet]]. Arthur, along with his brothers Ralph and Sonny, formed a Dixieland combo, the Carolina Crackerjacks, who appeared briefly on radio in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]].

They had limited success with their jazz format, and became more popular as a country music group. Arthur Smith moved to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] to join the cast of the [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] ''Carolina Barndance,'' a live show and radio program. Before [[World War II]], he was an occasional member of the WBT Briarhoppers band.

==Post-World War II career==
After wartime service in the US Navy, Smith returned to Charlotte. He was joined in his recording career by his brothers, wife Dorothy and vocalist Roy Lear. He also started his own radio show, ''Carolina Calling,'' on WBT.  Smith emceed part of the first live television program broadcast in 1951 by the new television station, [[WBTV]], in Charlotte.<ref name="kenil"/>

His own ''The Arthur Smith Show'' was the first country music television show to be syndicated nationally; it ran for 32 years in 90 markets coast to coast.<ref name="obit"/><ref name="kenil">[http://www.kenilworthmedia.com/cv/ourstate/people/arthur_smith.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008105436/http://www.kenilworthmedia.com/cv/ourstate/people/arthur_smith.htm|date=October 8, 2007}}</ref> In Charlotte, the show ran on WBTV until April 1, 1971, when it moved to [[WSOC-TV]], with the radio show moving from WBT to [[WYFQ (AM)|WSOC]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Arthur Smith's Show Is Switching Channels|last=Paddock|first=Polly|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=February 12, 1971|page=1B}}</ref> His band, renamed Arthur Smith & His Crackerjacks, became an institution in the Southeast area through the new medium. They had a daily early-morning variety program, ''Carolina Calling'', which was carried on the [[CBS|CBS-TV]] network as a summer-replacement during the 1950s. This increased Smith's national visibility. Unusually for a country music band, his band relied on tight arrangements with written "charts" for most of their music.
 
<blockquote>"He was a good neighbor on radio and TV to so many people," said Tom Hanchett, historian at the [[Levine Museum of the New South]]. "He was somebody who came to you every day in your living room or kitchen and felt like a member of the family in a way hard to imagine today. He was from the same mold as Doc Watson and Andy Griffith. He enjoyed the genial tradition of being a Southern gentleman. He relished that."<ref name="obit"/></blockquote>

In 1955, Smith composed a banjo instrumental he called "Feudin' Banjos", and recorded the song with five-string banjo player [[Don Reno]]. Later the composition was performed in the popular 1972 film ''[[Deliverance]],'' retitled "[[Dueling Banjos]]" and played by [[Eric Weissberg]] and [[Steve Mandell]]. It was released as a single becoming a major hit: played on Top 40, AOR, and country stations alike. It reached the Top Ten in several categories and hit #1 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] and [[Record World]] US pop charts. It was also a #1 country hit in the US and Canada.<ref name="bluegrass"/> Not credited for this piece in the film, Smith filed a legal suit against [[Warner Brothers]], winning a "substantial settlement;"<ref name="obit"/> it included his being awarded songwriting credit and back royalties. This was considered a landmark copyright infringement suit.

As a composer, Smith had nearly 500 copyrights, including over 100 active inspirational and/or gospel music compositions. "The Fourth Man" and "I Saw A Man" were million sellers. In total, his compositions have been recorded numerous times, by artists including [[Chet Atkins]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[the Statesmen Quartet]], [[the Cathedrals]], [[Al Hirt]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[the Gatlin Brothers]], [[Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Boots Randolph]], [[George Beverly Shea]],<ref>Connie Nelson and Floyd Harris, ''Film Junkie's Guide to North Carolina''
(John F. Blair, 2004):348.</ref> [[the Stamps]], [[the Statler Brothers]], [[Ricky Van Shelton]] and many more. A portion of his Crackerjacks group sang and recorded gospel music under the moniker the Crossroads Quartet. Among the members throughout the years were Smith, [[Tommy Faile]], Ray Atkins, Lois Atkins, brother Ralph Smith, and Wayne Haas.

In Charlotte, Smith founded in 1957 the first commercial recording studio in the Southeast.<ref name="obit"/> In addition to recording the Crackerjacks and its various members, he recorded such musicians as vocalist/guitarist/songwriter [[Tommy Faile]], [[Lester Flatt]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[George Beverly Shea]] and the Statler Brothers.<ref name="obit"/> He also produced sides from many other acts, including rhythm and blues star [[James Brown]], whose "[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]" (1965) was cut in Smith's studio. It was later ranked as "No. 72 in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time."<ref name="obit"/>  In this facility, Smith also created and produced nationally syndicated radio programs hosted by Johnny Cash, Chet Atkins, [[Richard Petty]], [[James Brown]], and [[George Beverly Shea]]. [[Billy Graham]]'s ''Hour of Decision'' radio program was first produced in Smith's studio. Smith also produced and hosted his own radio program, ''Top of the Morning'', which was syndicated for an unbroken span of 29 years.  In the 1970s, Smith produced a weekly, 30-minute videotaped program [[television syndication|syndicated]] in more than 90 TV markets at its peak. He produced radio and television shows for a number of other artists, including Johnny Cash, who had become a friend, and gospel singer [[George Beverly Shea]].

The Crackerjacks band employed a number of noted country musicians at various times, including [[Don Reno]], fiddler Jim Buchanan (later with [[Jim & Jesse]]'s Virginia Boys, [[Mel Tillis]]), banjoists David Deese, Carl Hunt and Jeff Whittington, resonator guitarist Ray Atkins (Johnny & Jack, [[Carl Story]]) and country singer [[George Hamilton IV]]. Other regular cast members included Wayne Haas, Maggie Griffin, Gerry Dionne, Don Ange, and Jackie Schuler, along with Ralph Smith and Tommy Faile.

As of fall 2006, Smith was retired. His extensive publishing interests, production company, and management business are managed by his son, Clay Smith.<ref name="cmaworld.com">[http://www.cmaworld.com/news_publications/pr_common/press_detail.asp?re=590&year=2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919091005/http://www.cmaworld.com/news_publications/pr_common/press_detail.asp?re=590&year=2006|date=September 19, 2010}}</ref> The younger Smith, a noted recording artist, ran Johnny Cash's businesses in the late 1970s.
