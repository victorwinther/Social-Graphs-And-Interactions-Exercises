===Musical career===
After remission, Sharp worked at [[California's Great America|Great America]] in [[Santa Clara, California]], while working on a demo tape, which he sent to various talent shows, and later to David Foster.<ref name="allmusic"/> Foster introduced him to [[A&R]] representatives and, by 1996, Sharp was signed to [[Asylum Records]]. His first album, ''Measure of a Man'', was released in September 1996.

In 1998, Sharp collapsed backstage at the [[Spike TV|TNN]] Music City News Country Awards, and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery, due to problems with steel rods in his hip. As a result, he had to cancel several tour dates.<ref name="cmt2">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041148/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1475130/20030731/kevin_sharp.jhtml Kevin Sharp: Sharper Than Ever]</ref> ''Measure of a Man'' produced two more top 10 country singles, "[[She's Sure Taking It Well]]" and "[[If You Love Somebody]]". The album's fourth single, "There's Only You", peaked at No.&nbsp;43. His second album, ''Love Is'', released in 1998 on Asylum, failed to produce any successful singles, and Sharp was dropped from Asylum's roster.<ref name="cmtdeath">[https://web.archive.org/web/20140424083509/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1726478/kevin-sharp-hitmaker-of-the-90s-dies-at-age-43.jhtml Notice of death of Kevin Sharp], cmt.com; accessed April 27, 2014.</ref>

Sharp continued to perform as a musician, as well as a motivational speaker, and was also a spokesperson for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
