James started playing the guitar at 13 and within a year was playing on stage. James has played acoustic sets with his mother, and blues with his older brother.  He has also played with country and rock bands.<ref>Montgomery, James (May 19, 2010).

Before ''American Idol'', he played with his band, The Casey James Band, consisting of James, his brother, Billy Cole (bass), and Jacy McCann (drums). They recorded four songs, including the first song that James ever wrote, "Freezing," back in 2002.

==Musical influences==
James cites blues guitarist [[Doyle Bramhall II]] as a major musical influence and whom he would most like to perform with in his Idol Q&A.<ref name="AI-contCJ"/> Another major influence is [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]; James named Vaughan's ''[[In the Beginning (Stevie Ray Vaughan album)|In the Beginning]]'' (1992) as a formative album in his early years.

<blockquote>I got an album called “In the Beginning” and I learned every note on it, which was easier to do because it was early on in his career [it was recorded in 1980]. I learned all those notes and it opened me up to the blues. When you look what he was doing, a lot of it was covers, and then you go back and start listening to those guys -- the originals Albert King, Freddie King, Albert Collins -- those influences changed me, too.</blockquote>

Other influences cited in the article are southern rockers [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[Pearl Jam]].<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/americanidoltracker/2010/05/casey-james-the-soundtrack-to-my-life.html "Casey James: The soundtrack to my life."]. Idol Tracker. May 19, 2010. LA Times.</ref>

==''American Idol''==
James was a contestant on ''[[American Idol]]'' during its ninth season. He made it to the Top 3 before being eliminated on May 19, 2010. James had tried out for and been selected to compete in the ninth season of ''Idol'' in 2009 in spite of the fact that he had never seen the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2010/03/casey-james-turns-into-a-triple-threat-with-gavin-degraw-and-his-guitar/1 |title=Casey James turns into a triple threat with Gavin DeGraw and his guitar |work=USA Today: Idol Chatter |date=March 2, 2010 |access-date=March 17, 2010}}</ref> He was the oldest contestant to be selected for the Top 24 of the ninth season at the age of 27. James was voted off of the competition on May 19, 2010, and finished in third place. During the finale of ''American Idol'', he performed a duet of "[[Every Rose Has Its Thorn]]" with [[Bret Michaels]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100606165914/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/06/03/bret-michaels-casey-james/ "Bret Michaels And Casey James Hit It Off Right Away: The MTV News Quote Of The Day"]. June 3, 2010. MTV Newsroom. MTV Networks.</ref>

''[[USA Today]]'' music critic [[Brian Mansfield]] suggested that James was "the best guitar player the show [''American Idol''] has seen."<ref>{{cite news |title=Here's the scoop on the 'American Idol' Chosen 12 |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |date=March 12, 2010 |access-date=March 17, 2010 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2010-03-12-idolfinalists12_ST_N.htm |work=USA Today |quote=Casey James: Arguably the broadest musical background of the 12 and best guitar player the show has seen.}}</ref>
