She co-wrote the song "[[Automatic (Miranda Lambert song)|Automatic]]" sung by [[Miranda Lambert]] which was named the 2015 [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]]'s 'Song of the Year' and the 2014 [[Country Music Association|CMA's]] single of the year.

==Career==
Originally from [[Sterling, Kansas]], Galyon made her way to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 2002 to attend [[Belmont University]] for Music Business. At Belmont, Galyon discovered her passion for songwriting <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nashvillesongwriters.com/nicolle-galyon|title=Nicolle Galyon|date=29 November 2014}}</ref> and signed a publishing deal with [[Warner Chappell Music|Warner/Chappell Nashville]] shortly after graduating in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.belmont.edu/alumni-share-songwriting-advice-through-career-conversations-series/|title = Alumni Share Songwriting Advice through 'Career Conversations' Series|date = 13 January 2017}}</ref> In 2012, she appeared on ''[[The Voice (American season 2)|season 2 of The Voice]]'' as a contestant on [[Adam Levine]]'s team, then being eliminated in the battle rounds.<ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7767504/nicolle-galyon-voice-songwriter-producer-advocate-profile|title=Nicolle Galyon's Journey From 'Voice' Contestant to Hit Songwriter, Producer, Creative Rights Advocate|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref> There she met [[RaeLynn]] and [[Miranda Lambert]], two friendships that she accredits for kickstarting her songwriting career.<ref name=":0" /> 

Galyon earned her first #1 song with "[[We Were Us]]" performed by [[Keith Urban]] and Miranda Lambert. Soon after this success, veteran Nashville songwriting heavyweights like [[Shane McAnally]] and [[Josh Osborne]] noticed her and invited her to be a part of their in-the-round performances.<ref name="paulsontn">{{cite news |last1=Paulson |first1=Dave |title=Nicolle Galyon on Songwriting, Tin Pan South and Artists Who Give Inspiration |issue=71 |publisher=The Tennessean |date=March 24, 2023 |volume=119 |page=1–C}}</ref> Speaking about this later, Galyon said, "I remember it was conflicting for me because I only had one song to play that anyone knew...but they could each play 20 hits, all night long".<ref name="paulsontn"/> She said that their stamp of approval gave her confidence and kept her going.<ref name="paulsontn"/> 

With co-writers Miranda Lambert and [[Natalie Hemby]], Galyon won 2015 [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]]'s 'Song of the Year', and the 2014 [[Country Music Association|CMA]]'s single of the year for the Miranda Lambert's  [[Automatic (Miranda Lambert song)|Automatic]]. Since then Galyon has had songs recorded by [[RaeLynn]] on her album ''[[WildHorse]]'', [[Dan + Shay]] on their album [[Obsessed (Dan + Shay album)|''Obsessed'']], [[Kenny Chesney]] on his album ''[[Cosmic Hallelujah]]'', [[Florida Georgia Line]] on their album ''[[Dig Your Roots]]'', [[Lady Antebellum]] on their album [[Golden (Lady Antebellum album)|''Golden'']], and [[Thomas Rhett]] on his album [[Tangled Up (Thomas Rhett album)|''Tangled Up'']], among others.

==Record label== 

Galyon partnered with [[Big Loud|Big Loud Records]] to launch the female-focused record label, "Songs and Daughters". The label was announced in July, 2019 and signed Madison Kozak as its flagship artist. In 2020, Galyon expanded the label to include a publishing arm. In 2020, Galyon served as a producer and writer on [[iHeartRadio]] scripted podcast "Make It Up As We Go." 

== Philanthropy ==
