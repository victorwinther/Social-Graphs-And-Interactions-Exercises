'''Rehab''' is an American [[hip hop]] group from [[Warner Robins, Georgia]].<ref name="Biography"/> The band recorded seven albums, initially as the duo of Danny "Boone" Alexander and Jason "Brooks" Buford, before Buford left the group and Alexander continued with the band as a quintet.

==History==
===1998–1999: Formation and debut===
Rehab was originally formed by vocalists Danny "Boone" Alexander and Jason "Brooks" Buford, with producer Denny "Steaknife" Campbell.

Boone and Campbell (both from Warner Robins, Georgia) were previously the rap group "Prime Suspect". Alexander and Buford were recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, and while it is a common misconception they met at a rehab facility, the trio did not meet within rehabilitation. Early on, they released their first album ''[[To Whom It May Consume]]'' produced by Campbell and Buford.

===2000–2002: Departure of Steaknife, and ''Southern Discomfort''===
Soon after ''To Whom It May Consume'', Campbell was incarcerated and Epic/Sony offered a record deal to Buford and Alexander as a duo. Mashing rap with rock, the duo released their major label debut album, ''[[Southern Discomfort (Rehab album)|Southern Discomfort]],'' in 2000 on the Sony label. Cee-Lo & Bigg Gipp of Goodie Mob, Mandy Lauderdale and Cody ChesnuTT were the guests on the album, which spawned the Top 15 modern rock hit "It Don't Matter", and "Sittin' At A Bar".

Two years were spent on the road supporting the album touring with Kottonmouth Kings and the Phunk Junkeez, including a stint on the Warped Tour.

===2002–2004: ''Cuz We Can'', departure of Buford, and hiatus===
For reasons not publicly clarified, Buford left the band, and released 26 unreleased Rehab songs on his website towards the end of his tenure. This collection was later known to fans as ''Cuz We Can''. 22 of the 26 songs were produced by Denny "Steaknife" Campbell, and the album was later given out to on tours by Boone in 2007. Boone also modified the track list of the pressed version, removing certain songs and adding new ones, in light of Buford's departure.

After two years on the road supporting the Vans Warped Tour and playing with bands such as Linkin Park, the group went on an indefinite hiatus. Buford did not return to the group, however, later appeared as host of 2005's ''[[List of programs broadcast by MTV|Trailer Fabulous]]'' on MTV and recorded a single for the show's theme, before joining the short-lived project The Audio Club with [[Tommy Henriksen|Tommy Hendriksen]].<ref name="Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rehab-p416355/biography|title=Rehab > Biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision]]|access-date=2011-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lang |first=Derrik J. |title=MTV show \'Trailer Fabulous\' tricks out mobile homes |url=https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/2005/08/05/mtv-show-trailer-fabulous-tricks-out-mobile-homes/48285067/ |access-date=2024-02-12 |website=The Herald-Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Writer |first=Derrik J.

===2004–2010: Reformation, ''Graffiti the World'', and ''Welcome Home''===
[[File:Rehabband.JPG|thumb|Rehab in Exeter New Hampshire at the Ioka Theatre in 2008]]
In 2004, Boone connected with Atlanta producer Shannon Houchins. WIth Houchins, a new band was assembled consisting of guitarist Mike Hartnett, Hano Leathers, Chris Hood and [[Foz]]. Now a quintet with Alexander, Rehab signed with Arshid Entertainment and released ''[[Graffiti the World]]'' in 2005.

Sometime in 2008, the three original members decided to do a reunion [[Extended Play|EP]] and go by the name Southern Discomfort. Their label saw this and decided to halt most of the promotion, since the name of Southern Discomfort was essentially owned by Epic/Sony. As a result, the label released ''Sitting at a Bar,'' which was a [[Reissue|re-release]] of their debut album. All of this was done without the band's permission.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rehab Discography|date=14 October 2008|url=http://rehab-world.blogspot.com/2008/10/rehab-discography.html|publisher=Nate|access-date=23 March 2016}}</ref>

To fight this unauthorized reissue, the band re-recorded the single and renamed it "Bartender Song." This version would end up on a 2008 version of ''[[Graffiti the World]]'' released by the major label, Universal. Rehab stuck with Universal for their 2010 album ''[[Welcome Home (Rehab Album)|Welcome Home]],'' which saw a handful of singles on the Top 30 video countdown for CMT through January 2011.

===2011–2014: ''Gullible's Travels'' and breakup===
''[[Gullible's Travels (Rehab Album)|Gullible's Travels]]'' was released on February 21, 2012 through AVJ Records (a subsidiary label of [[Average Joe's Entertainment]]) owned by former Rehab producer and manager Shannon Houchins and country music artist [[Colt Ford]]. Touring followed with the single "Waho by the Hoti" ("the Waffle House by the hotel"). The video for their single "King of Tweakers", which was released on their website in the summer of 2011, premiered on February 21, 2012 with the album release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rehab About|url=http://www.rehabmusic.com/about|publisher=Rehab|access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref> A video for the next single "Can't Catch Up To You" was also recorded.

On July 3, 2013, a track by [[Twiztid]] was released off their first mixtape [[A New Nightmare]] entitled "Unjust love", featuring Danny Alexander.

The band released a 2013 single "Whore" which would be the last recorded content by the band. In 2014, the band released a statement to their fans that they would be going on a farewell tour and disband to form solo careers. Before the break, the band recorded a full album titled ''Million Dollar Mugshot,'' which [[Average Joes Entertainment]] did not release until 2017.

===2015–2016: Possible reformation===
Sometime in June 2015, former founding member Denny Campbell posted on his Facebook page that said there was a possible Rehab reunion between Alexander and himself. He continued to post pictures of him and Boone in the studio as well. On March 19, 2016, a possible album cover was posted on Rehab's website. On September 1, 2017, ''Million Dollar Mug Shot'' was finally released.

===2017–present: Reformation===
On December 31, 2017, Alexander announced via video on the official Rehab Facebook page<ref>https://www.facebook.com/rehabmusic/videos/10159759494615076/ {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref> that Rehab had returned. In the video, he stated there would be new music and tour in 2018. He also stated that the band lineup is now Danny Boone and Jericho,<ref>https://www.facebook.com/jay.j.robinson.10 {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref> in addition to a full band.

On April 12, 2019, the studio album titled ''Galaga'' was released. This is the first album released independently with the help of ONErpm. Full tours in 2019 and 2020 followed. The tour included a band but with a different lineup as prior iteration as seen below.
