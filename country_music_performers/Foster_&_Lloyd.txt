'''Foster & Lloyd''' is an American [[country music]] duo consisting of singer-songwriters  [[Radney Foster]] and [[Bill Lloyd (country musician)|Bill Lloyd]]. After pairing up in 1986, the duo recorded three albums for [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]], charting nine singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. The highest-peaking of these was their debut single  "[[Crazy Over You]]", a No.&nbsp;4 hit in 1987. After disbanding in 1990, Foster and Lloyd began solo careers. They reunited in 2010 to release a fourth studio album.

==Description and history==
The tandem consists of [[Radney Foster]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Bill Lloyd (harmony and occasional lead vocals, lead and rhythm guitars). 

They met while employed at [[MTM Records|MTM]] publishing in [[Nashville]].<ref name="Builta">Builta, David. "Radney Foster's hit moves up on charts." Del Rio News-Herald 29 Sept 1987: 8</ref> They co-wrote the country hit "Since I Found You" in 1986 for [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]] before obtaining their own record deal.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1613/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Foster & Lloyd biography |access-date=2008-01-07 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Their [[Foster & Lloyd (album)|self-titled debut LP]] produced five hit singles on the U.S. ''Billboard'' country music charts. Follow-up albums, ''[[Faster & Llouder]]''<!--it really was spelled with two L's--> (1989) and ''[[Version of the Truth]]'' (1990) were less successful. After the third record, they parted ways and embarked on solo careers.<ref name="allmusic"/> They reunited in 2010 and released a fourth studio album in May 2011.

In 1987, while still a member of the duo, Lloyd released his debut solo album, ''Feeling the Elephant''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Stewart|title=Bill Lloyd: Feeling the Elephant|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/feeling-the-elephant-mw0000676757|website=AllMusic|access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref> The album's [[power pop]] style greatly differed from that of Foster & Lloyd, and was critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|title=A beginners' guide to the heyday of power-pop, 1972-1986|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/a-beginners-guide-to-the-heyday-of-power-pop-1972--86527|website=The AV Club|access-date=24 July 2016|date=11 October 2012}}</ref> Following the disbanding of the group, Lloyd released a second album, ''Set to Pop''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Set to Pop - Bill Lloyd|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/set-to-pop-mw0000113267|website=AllMusic}}</ref>

==Style==
They were hailed by critics for their tasteful blend of popular country and rock and roll. Foster described their style "a country garage band" which is "harking back to what was best in music in the '50s and '60s and making it part of the '80s."<ref name="Thomas">Thomas, Ann. "Del Rioan Radney describes basis for unique sound of Foster & Lloyd music." Del Rio News-Herald 16 Apr 1988: 7</ref><ref name="Builta2">Builta, David. "Del Rioan Radney Foster Makes Good in Nashville." Del Rio News-Herald 8 Mar 1987: 3</ref> Their musical style combined Foster's plainspoken lyrics with Lloyd's virtuoso guitar licks and power pop sensibilities.<ref name="Builta"/>
