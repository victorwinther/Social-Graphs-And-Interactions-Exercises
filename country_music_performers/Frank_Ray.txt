'''Francisco Gomez''' (born January 8, 1987), known professionally as '''Frank Ray''', is an American [[country music]] singer. Signed to [[BBR Music Group]], he has released the single "Country'd Look Good on You".

==Biography==
Francisco Gomez is a native of [[Deming, New Mexico]]. His parents divorced when he was four years old, and he lived with his mother in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He then moved to [[Columbus, New Mexico]] with his father. It was through his moving that he began listening to not only [[country music]], but also ''[[ranchera]]'' music. As he is of Hispanic descent, he thought that he would "stand out" as a country musician, citing other Hispanic artists such as [[Freddy Fender]] as inspiration on this front.<ref name="lcs"/>

From 2007 to 2017, Gomez worked as a [[police officer]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. After having success with performances on weekends and gaining regional commercial success with songs on the Texas country charts, he retired from the police force and began singing full-time. He released an EP titled ''Different Kind of Country'' in 2018 under his performing name of Frank Ray. In addition, he became an opening act for [[Ashley McBryde]].<ref name="lcs">{{cite web | url=https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2019/01/06/movers-shakers-2019-frank-ray-borderland-musician-cop-country-music/2407500002/ | title=Movers and Shakers 2019: Frank Ray sings for the borderland | work=Las Cruces Sun News | date=January 6, 2019 | access-date=January 26, 2022}}</ref>

In 2021, Ray signed with [[BBR Music Group]] and released the song "Streetlights". The song features Ray singing in both English and Spanish.
