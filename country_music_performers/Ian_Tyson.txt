There he performed in local clubs and in 1959 began to sing on occasion with [[Sylvia Tyson|Sylvia Fricker]].<ref name=":1" /> By early 1959 Tyson and Fricker were performing part-time at the Village Corner as [[Ian & Sylvia]]. The pair became a full-time musical act in 1961 and married three years later. In 1969, they formed and fronted the group [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|The Great Speckled Bird]].

From 1970 to 1975, Tyson hosted a national television program, ''The Ian Tyson Show'', on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], known as ''Nashville North'' in its first season.

In 1980, Tyson became associated with Calgary music manager and producer [[Neil MacGonigill]]. Tyson decided to concentrate on [[country music|country]] and [[cowboy music]], resulting in the well-received 1983 album ''Old Corrals and Sagebrush'',<ref>[[Heath McCoy]], [http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=243398d1-ce40-4624-a9ea-e9bfdb598778&sponsor= Field of dreamers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622043655/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=243398d1-ce40-4624-a9ea-e9bfdb598778&sponsor= |date=22 June 2015 }}.

In 1989, Tyson was inducted into the [[Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame]]. His next albums were cowboy music: ''I Outgrew the Wagon'' (1989), ''And Stood There Amazed'' (1991), and ''Eighteen Inches of Rain'' (1994).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1999/2/15/home-on-the-range |title=Home on the range &#124; Maclean's |date=15 February 1999 |first=Brian |last=Bergman |website=Maclean's magazine archive |access-date=13 April 2021 |archive-date=30 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221230021050/https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1999/2/15/home-on-the-range |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tyson credited [[Adrian Chornowol]] with creating a unique sound for his platinum album "Cowboyography", a unique style that he maintained for the rest of his recording career.<ref name="zagria">{{cite web | url=https://zagria.blogspot.com/2010/12/toby-dancer-1953-2004-musician.html | title=A Gender Variance Who's Who: Toby Dancer (1953 – 2004) musician | date=13 December 2010 }}</ref>

In 2005, [[CBC Radio One]] listeners chose his song "[[Four Strong Winds]]" as the greatest Canadian song of all time on the series ''[[50 Tracks: The Canadian Version]]''. There was strong momentum for him to be nominated the Greatest Canadian, but he fell short. He has been a strong influence on many Canadian artists, including [[Neil Young]], who recorded "Four Strong Winds" for ''[[Comes a Time]]'' (1978).  [[Johnny Cash]] would also record the same song for ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' (2006). [[Judy Collins]] recorded a version of his song "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]" in 1968.<ref name="zagria"/>

[[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Band]] recorded his song "One Single River" in Woodstock, New York, in 1967. The recording can be found on the unreleased [[List of Basement Tapes songs|Genuine Basement Tapes]], vol.

In 2006, Tyson sustained irreversible scarring to his vocal cords as a result of a concert at the [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] followed a year later by a virus contracted during a flight to [[Denver]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ian-tysons-brave-new-cd |title= Ian Tyson's Brave New CD|magazine= Maclean's|access-date= 5 March 2011|date= 1 December 2008}}</ref> This resulted in a notable loss of the vocal quality and range he was known for; he has self-described his new sound as "gravelly".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ian-tyson-emc/ |title= Ian Tyson|encyclopedia=Canadian Encyclopedia |access-date=5 March 2011 }}</ref> Notwithstanding, he released the album ''From Yellowhead to Yellowstone and Other Love Stories'' in 2008 to high critical praise.

Tyson has also written a book of [[young adult fiction]] about his song "La Primera", called ''La Primera: The Story of Wild Mustangs''.<ref>{{cite book |title= La primera : the story of wild mustangs|last= Tyson|first= Ian|others= Paintings by Adeline Halvorson|year= 2009|publisher= [[Tundra Books]]|location= Toronto|isbn= 978-0-88776-863-7|oclc= 226999077}}</ref>

After the divorce, Tyson returned to southern Alberta to farm and train horses but also continued his musical career on a limited basis. In 1978, Neil Young recorded "Four Strong Winds", and Tyson used the royalties for a down payment on a cattle and horse ranch. He started playing regularly at Calgary's Ranchman's Club around this time.<ref name="Klaszus">{{cite web |last1=Klaszus |first1=Jeremy |title=The Gift: What Ian Tyson Left Us |url=https://www.sprawlcalgary.com/remembering-ian-tyson |website=The Sprawl |access-date=21 January 2023 |date=31 December 2022}}</ref>

"We’ve been lovers for 55 years. ... How many people can say that?" Tyson said.
