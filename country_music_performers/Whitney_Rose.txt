== History ==
Whitney Rebecca Rose was raised by her mother Laurie Rose and her grandparents, Jean (née Dunn)<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.inmemoriam.ca/view-announcement-504035-john-p-rose.html|title=John P. Rose: obituary and death notice on InMemoriam|website=Inmemoriam.ca|access-date=August 13, 2017|archive-date=August 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813231354/http://www.inmemoriam.ca/view-announcement-504035-john-p-rose.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and John P. Rose (1947–2015),<ref name=":3" /> in [[Charlottetown]], the capital of Prince Edward Island, where she lived in a home with her mother's younger brothers and sisters. Her grandparents ran a bar called the Union Hall. Rose's favorite song from the age of two was [[Hank Williams]]’ "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]", which she'd sing to bar customers – sometimes crawling downstairs after her bedtime, and sometimes being paid a dollar to sing. As she jokes, "I guess it became my career pretty early on. And the pay is about the same now, too. Not much has changed."<ref name=":2" />

Her grandfather's "song of choice" was the [[Johnny Cash]] classic "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", which she often includes in her set lists in his memory. As an 8-year-old, Rose made a road trip with her mother to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] where she saw [[The Rankin Family]], a regional group that mixed [[Celtic music|Celtic]] and country sounds. It was her first big concert. She plays the group's music on the tour bus "because nobody really outside of the (Canadian) East Coast has even heard of them. . . I don't think it's solely nostalgia. I actually enjoy the music, too."<ref name=":2" />

Rose attended five different colleges, studying journalism and majoring in English. A "starter guitar" given to her by her Uncle Dan started her writing songs. Moving to Toronto from "a farm in the middle of nowhere in Nova Scotia", and a failed relationship, she'd written enough songs for a record. In Toronto she got "immersed" in the Cameron House scene, the bar becoming a second home. She released her self-titled debut record in 2012 for fledgling Cameron House Records.<ref name=":2" />

She got signed by "great booking agents" in 2013 and made a "one-off appearance" opening for U.S. country act [[The Mavericks]] in Toronto. She later toured as an opening act for [[Raul Malo]]’s band. Rose received a Gibson acoustic guitar, which she named "Aggie", as a 27th-birthday present from a boyfriend in 2013. Rose says of the instrument, "I always kind of meant it to be just a writing tool. ... It's kind of one of the biggest surprises of my life that I actually play guitar in front of people night after night because at one point it would have been absolutely my worst nightmare."<ref name=":2" />

She signed with Six Shooter Records in 2016 and is managed by Michael McKeown, former president of Cameron House Records.<ref name=":2" />

=== ''Heartbreaker of the Year (2015)'' ===
Rose's sophomore release was produced by The Mavericks' frontman, Raul Malo, and includes two covers: [[Hank Williams]]’ "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]" and "[[Be My Baby (Vanessa Paradis song)|Be My Baby]]" by the [[The Ronettes|Ronettes]]. Rose and Malo have often sung the [[Nancy Sinatra|Nancy]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] duet "[[Somethin' Stupid|Somethin’ Stupid]]" together onstage.<ref name="americansongwriter">{{cite magazine|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2015/08/whitney-rose-heartbreaker-year/|title=Whitney Rose: Heartbreaker of the Year|last1=Horowitz|first1=Hal|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}</ref>

American Songwriter says: "There’s a robust countrypolitan vibe to much of this, that hits its peak on the string enhanced ballad “Ain’t it Wise,” with Malo on backing vocals, sounding like a hit from the mid-’60s. Rose sings in a sweet, strong, vulnerable voice that’s both powerful and subtle, a tricky balance she pulls off with a smooth and soulful edge."<ref name="americansongwriter" /> They note: “The Devil Borrowed My Boots” is "terrifically crafted and brilliantly realized roots music guaranteed to provoke smiles."<ref name="americansongwriter" />

[[Rolling Stone]] says on this release that Rose "playfully croons through tales of love and mischief with girlish breath and devilish twang."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/americana-music-fest-2015-27-must-see-acts-20150915/whitney-rose-20150915|title=Americana Music Fest 2015: 27 Must-See Acts|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 10, 2017|archive-date=August 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811011055/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/americana-music-fest-2015-27-must-see-acts-20150915/whitney-rose-20150915|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Style ==
"[[countrypolitan]] [[chanteuse]]"<ref name=":1" /> Rose writes and performs traditional and contemporary American country music. She refers humorously to her style as "vintage-pop-infused-neo-traditional-country."<ref name=":2" />

== Influences ==
Turning her nose up at her family collection of more currently popular fare, Rose favored the "queen bees" of Nashville like [[Kitty Wells]], [[Tammy Wynette]], and [[Dolly Parton]]. She also preferred "country kingpins" like Hank Williams, [[George Jones]], and [[Keith Whitley]]. Rummaging through her grandparents’ cassette tapes, she discovered the Ronettes and "the ‘[[Runaround Sue]]’ guy," [[Dion DiMucci]]. Of her taste for music, Rose says, "I still listen to that stuff today. And I did even through my teenage years. My friends never wanted to drive with me because I would not be listening to like quote-unquote cool music."<ref name=":2" />

She participated in a [[Judy Garland]] tribute show, really getting into 1940s music. "I’m a huge Judy Garland fan," she says.<ref name=":2" />

== Personal ==
Rose has six "half-siblings" and she utilizes technology to feel closer to her family and friends "back home". She says her grandmother is "probably the only person who I stay in touch with every single day. We talk and text a lot. A lot, a lot."<ref name=":2" />
