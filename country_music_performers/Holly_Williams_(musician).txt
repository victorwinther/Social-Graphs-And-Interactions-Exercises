'''Holly Audrey Williams''' (born March 12, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. She is the granddaughter of [[Hank Williams]], the niece of [[Jett Williams]], daughter of [[Hank Williams Jr.]], half-sister of [[Hank Williams III]], and aunt of [[Coleman Williams]]. Williams has released three studio albums: ''The Ones We Never Knew'' in 2004, ''Here with Me'' in 2009 and ''The Highway'' in 2013. ''The Highway'' was released on Williams' own label, Georgiana Records, and reached No. 146 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]

==Early life==
Williams's mother, Becky, is a native of [[Mer Rouge, Louisiana]], and was married to Hank Williams Jr. for a decade.<ref name="cmt"/>{{dead link|date=November 2019}}<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p659745/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Holly Williams biography |last=Jeffries |first=David|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=2009-04-29}}</ref> She was born in [[Cullman, Alabama]], and has an elder sister named Hilary. Her parents separated when she was young. At age 17, Williams began playing one of her father's guitars, and soon began writing songs.

Williams attended elementary school at St. Paul Christian Academy in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. She graduated from [[Brentwood Academy]] and decided to pursue her passion of songwriting and continue playing guitar and piano. She purchased her domain name, recorded an [[Extended play|EP]], initiated a website, and booked herself at various Nashville clubs.

==Career==
Soon after signing with [[Creative Artists Agency|CAA]], she performed many shows throughout the US and usually toured alone with a guitar and keyboard driving her mother's car across the country. She went to the UK to open for songwriter [[Ron Sexsmith]] with a backpack full of EPs and a guitar. After the release of her first EP in 2003, she signed with [[Universal South Records]] and toured with [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Train (band)|Train]], [[Keith Urban]], and [[Kasey Chambers]]. Universal South released her debut album, ''[[The Ones We Never Knew]]'', in 2004.<ref name="cmt"/><ref name="allmusic"/>

In March 2006, Williams was injured in a car crash with her sister Hilary Williams, and canceled her upcoming tour. Her sister was seriously injured, enduring 23 surgeries.<ref name=recalls>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1654740/hilary-williams-recalls-tragic-car-accident-in-sign-of-life.jhtml|title=Hilary Williams Recalls Tragic Car Accident in Sign of Life|date=December 21, 2010|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|access-date=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220093916/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1654740/hilary-williams-recalls-tragic-car-accident-in-sign-of-life.jhtml|archive-date=February 20, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Holly Williams' right arm and wrist were broken; she was unsure of when she would play again. She wrote "Without Jesus Here with Me" about her experience during the time of the car accident; it was released on her next record. Hilary Williams wrote a book called ''Sign of Life'' about her experience.<ref name=recalls/> Holly Williams made small musical appearances at this time, one of them joining [[John C. Reilly]] in Nashville, Tennessee, to sing "Let's Duet" during the release of ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' on December 9, 2007.

After a long break Williams began playing guitar and writing songs again, she signed with Luke Lewis at [[Mercury Records]]. Williams' second studio album, ''[[Here with Me (album)|Here with Me]]'', was released in June 2009. To promote the album, Williams appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and ''[[Chelsea Lately]]''. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine named Williams' 2009 album "one of the top ten albums of the year". ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said it was "one of the best singer/songwriter albums to come out of Nashville". ''[[USA Today]]'' said "Hank Williams' granddaughter reveals a heart-on-sleeve intensity that might be grating were it not for the purity and potency of her milk-and-whiskey-kissed singing and the catchy clarity and integrity of her songs".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2009-06-15-listen-up-jobros_N.htm|title=Listen Up: JoBros grow up through the 'Trying Times'|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 19, 2009|access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> She filmed a music video for "Alone" and "Three Days in Bed" in [[Paris]].

Williams finished a six-week tour in Europe in early 2010, and continued the rest of the year headlining gigs and opening for other artists such as [[John Hiatt]].  After [[Bob Dylan]] called, Williams added her own music and lyrics to a half written Hank Williams Sr. lyric for a project entitled ''[[The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams]]'' that he assembled, released in September 2011. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Lucinda Williams]] were alongside Williams for this project.

Williams was also a part of ''Let Us In'', a project produced by [[Phil Madeira]] which includes artists singing their favorite [[Paul McCartney]] songs in tribute to [[Linda McCartney]]. Williams performed "[[My Love (Paul McCartney & Wings song)|My Love]]" from the [[Wings (band)|Wings]] era. [[Steve Earle]] and [[Buddy Miller]] are also included on the album.

Williams was featured on the soundtrack for ''[[Flicka]]'' singing "Rodeo Road", written by [[Tom Douglas (songwriter)|Tom Douglas]] and [[Chuck Cannon]]. [[Tim McGraw]] (who starred in ''Flicka'') named Williams, [[The Fray]] and [[Coldplay]] as his favorite artists in ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'' saying "She has the ability to make you believe what she says, to make you feel vulnerable. She's intense and moody; she puts you in a time and place where you never would have imagined yourself—and then you're there."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Tim-McGraws-Favorite-Music|title=What's Playing in Tim McGraw's Ear?|publisher=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]| date=October 2009 |access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> [[Mel Gibson]] met with Williams in Nashville and featured her on [[The Passion of the Christ (soundtrack)|''The Passion of The Christ'' soundtrack]] singing "How Can You Refuse Him Now", written by her grandfather.

Williams' third album, ''[[The Highway (album)|The Highway]]'', co-produced by Williams and [[Charlie Peacock]] was released on February 5, 2013. She wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, which is common for her recordings.  This album includes [[Dierks Bentley]], [[Jakob Dylan]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Jackson Browne]] adding backing harmonies. ''The Highway'' was released to critical acclaim. ''[[American Songwriter]]'' magazine said "Williams has recorded her most accomplished, mature and world weary album. Even Hank Sr. would be proud."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/02/holly-williams-the-highway/|title=Holly Williams: The Highway|work=[[American Songwriter]]|date=February 5, 2013|access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated "Williams is often closer to songwriters like John Prine or [[Bruce Springsteen]], than the smiley Nashville mainstream."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/arts/music/albums-from-bilal-the-stark-reality-and-holly-williams.html|title=R&B From Another Edge, Jazz When It Was Still Fusing|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Jon Pareles|author-link=Jon Pareles|date=February 22, 2013|access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> ''[[People Magazine]]'' gave the album three and a half stars and said the album was "sure to go down as one of the year's best country albums".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Arnold |first1=Chuck |last2=Grerr |first2=Carlos |title=Music |magazine=People |date=February 18, 2013 |volume=79 |issue=7 |page=49}}</ref> A music video for "Drinkin'" aired on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] networks.
