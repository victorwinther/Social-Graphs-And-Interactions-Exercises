Fast Ryde's first single release was "[[That Thang]]," which the duo wrote after Stevens suggested that the two write a "[[buttocks|booty]] song."<ref name="weekly"/> This song was met with mixed reviews. Juli Thanki of Engine 145 gave the single a thumbs-down rating, criticizing the song for its repeated use of sung syllables and its similarity in theme to [[Trace Adkins]]' "[[Honky Tonk Badonkadonk]]."<ref>{{cite web |last=Thanki |first=Juli |title=Fast Ryde — "That Thang" |url=http://www.engine145.com/fast-ryde-that-thang/ |date=July 1, 2009|work=Engine 145 |access-date=July 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218075121/http://www.engine145.com/fast-ryde-that-thang/ |archive-date=December 18, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Alison Bonaguro, who reviewed the song in the blog for television network [[Country Music Television|CMT]] said that it was "a nice little catchy rocker."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cmt.com/2009-07-21/radios-jumping-on-the-fast-ryde/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724015940/http://blog.cmt.com/2009-07-21/radios-jumping-on-the-fast-ryde/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 24, 2009|title=Radio's jumping on the Fast Ryde|last=Bonaguro|first=Alison|date=July 2, 2009|work=CMT|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}</ref> Bobby Peacock of Roughstock also compared it to "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk," but also called the song a "silly little piece of ear candy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roughstock.com/news/2009/07/20649-fast-ryde-that-thang|title=Fast Ryde — "That Thang"|author=Bobby Peacock|date=July 2, 2009|work=Roughstock|accessdate=September 20, 2009}}</ref> The song peaked at 38 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts for the week ending September 26, 2009.

The duo released "Make It Rain" in October 2009. Robert K. Oermann of [[MusicRow]] said that the song was "quite listenable and easy-smooth,"<ref>Music Row Magazine, 2009-10-02, p.6</ref> and Peacock called it "just what Fast Ryde needs to get their foot in the door."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/fast-ryde-make-it-rain- |title=Fast Ryde — "Make It Rain" |author=Bobby Peacock |date=September 2, 2009|work=Roughstock |access-date=October 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228071359/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/fast-ryde-make-it-rain- |archive-date=December 28, 2010 }}</ref> "Top Down" was released as the duo's third single. It was also made into a music video, directed by Chris Hicky. After failing to chart with their second and third singles, they were released from Republic Nashville and their debut album was not released.

In late 2013, Stevens produced and performed all instrumentation on [[Cole Swindell]]'s debut single "[[Chillin' It]]".
