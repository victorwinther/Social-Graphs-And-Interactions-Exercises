'''The Clark Family Experience''' was an American [[country music]] band composed of six brothers, all with the surname Clark: Alan ([[guitar]], [[Singing|vocals]]), Aaron ([[bass guitar]], vocals), Adam ([[mandolin]], vocals), Ashley ([[fiddle]]), Andrew ([[Drum kit|drums]]), and Austin ([[lap steel guitar]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), all natives of the state of [[Virginia]].

Signed to [[Curb Records]] in 2000, The Clark Family Experience debuted on the American country music scene that year with the release of their single "[[Meanwhile Back at the Ranch]]". A Top 20 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, the song also became the thirteenth highest-selling single in the history of country music at the time. "Meanwhile Back at the Ranch" was the first of four chart singles from their [[The Clark Family Experience (album)|self-titled debut album]], released in 2001. Due to a series of financial problems, however, the band declared [[bankruptcy]] and disbanded later that year.

In 2007, Adam, Ashley, and Austin reunited as The Clark Brothers and won the [[Fox Networks]] talent show ''[[The Next Great American Band]]'' that year. The Clark Brothers has since been renamed [[Sons of Sylvia]].

==Biography==
The six members of The Clark Family Experience — Aaron, Adam, Alan, Andrew, Ashley and Austin — are part of a musically inclined family that comprises the eleven children of Freddy and Sylvia Clark. All six boys first performed professionally in 1993, eventually assuming the name The Clark Family Experience.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p454434|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Clark Family Experience Biography |accessdate=2007-12-27 |last=Wilson |first=MacKenzie |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

The band was signed as "series regulars" on [[The Oak Ridge Boys]]' 1998 television show on [[The Nashville Network]], ''Live From Las Vegas.'' The show aired 15 episodes, and although just a modest success, it introduced the band to a nationwide audience.

[[Curb Records]] signed The Clark Family Experience to a recording contract in 2000. The band also served as an opening act for several country musicians, including [[Faith Hill]] and [[Tim McGraw]]. McGraw also co-produced The Clark Family Experience's self-titled debut album, which was released on February 27, 2001.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/00s/2001/BB-2001-01-27.pdf|title=Popular Uprisings|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 27, 2001}}</ref> The album produced a total of four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, including "[[Meanwhile Back at the Ranch]]", which soon became a Top 20 hit on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, as well as the thirteenth highest-selling single in the history of country music at the time.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album's second single, "Standin' Still", peaked at No.&nbsp;36, while the third and fourth singles both failed to reach Top 40.

===Bankruptcy===
A year after the release of their debut album, The Clark Family Experience filed for [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1455008/20020605/clark_family_experience.jhtml |title=Clark Family Experiences Bankruptcy |accessdate=2007-12-27 |date=2002-06-05 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The band owed more than $800,000 in debt to Curb, citing mismanagement and unfair contracts from the label as the reasons for their debt.<ref name="ten">{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessean.com/business/archives/03/08/38047098.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203165410/http://www.tennessean.com/business/archives/03/08/38047098.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-03 |title=Clark Family Experience cuts ties with Curb Records |accessdate=2007-12-27 |last=Naujeck |first=Jeanne A. |date=2003-08-22 |work=The Tennessean}}</ref>

Curb then attempted to dismiss the Clark brothers' bankruptcies, claiming that the band was trying to exit its contract.<ref name="ten"/> In addition, the label tried to seek an injunction to keep the band from recording for any other label. By August 2003, the label had dropped the suit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1477132/20030821/clark_family_experience.jhtml |title=Curb Drops Clark Family Suit |accessdate=2007-12-27 |date=2003-08-21 |work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The Clark Family Experience disbanded soon afterward. Adam, Ashley, and Austin reunited in 2008 as The Clark Brothers and won the TV competition ''[[The Next Great American Band]]'' that year. In 2009, this trio changed its name to [[Sons of Sylvia]].
