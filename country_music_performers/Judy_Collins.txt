'''Judith Marjorie Collins''' (born May 1, 1939) is an American singer-songwriter and musician with a career spanning seven decades. An [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated documentary director and a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]]-winning recording artist, she is known for her eclectic tastes in the material she records (which has included [[folk music]], [[country music|country]], [[show tune]]s, [[pop music]], [[rock and roll]] and [[Traditional pop|standards]]), for her [[social activism]], and for the clarity of her voice. [[Judy Collins discography|Her discography]] consists of 36 studio albums, nine live albums, numerous compilation albums, four holiday albums, and 21 [[single (music)|singles]].

Collins' debut studio album, ''[[A Maid of Constant Sorrow]]'', was released in 1961 and consisted of traditional [[Folk music|folk songs]]. She had her first charting single with "Hard Lovin' Loser" (No. 97) from her fifth studio album ''[[In My Life (Judy Collins album)|In My Life]]'' (1966), but it was the [[lead single]] from her sixth studio album ''[[Wildflowers (Judy Collins album)|Wildflowers]]'' (1967), "[[Both Sides, Now]]" – written by [[Joni Mitchell]] – that gave her international prominence. The single reached No. 8 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Singles chart]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/305342/judy-collins/chart |title=Judy Collins – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 30, 2015}}</ref> and won Collins her first [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording|Best Folk Performance]].<ref name="Gram">{{cite news |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/judy-collins/12213 |title=Judy Collins |access-date=January 19, 2021}}</ref> She enjoyed further success with her recordings of "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]", "[[Chelsea Morning]]" (also written by Mitchell), "[[Amazing Grace]]", "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", and "Cook with Honey".

Collins experienced the biggest success of her career with her recording of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s "[[Send in the Clowns]]" from her tenth studio album ''[[Judith (album)|Judith]]'' (1975). The single peaked at No. 36 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart in 1975 and then again in 1977 at No. 19, spending 27 non-consecutive weeks on the chart and earning her a Grammy Award nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female]], as well as a Grammy Award for Sondheim for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/stephen-sondheim/12557 |title=Stephen Sondheim |access-date=January 19, 2021}}</ref> ''Judith'' also became her best-selling studio album; it was certified [[Music recording certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1975 for sales of over 500,000 copies and [[Music recording certification|Platinum]] in 1996 for sales of over 1,000,000 copies.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite certification |region=United States|certyear=2014|type=album|artist=Judy Collins}}</ref>

In 2017, Collins's rendition of the song "[[Amazing Grace (song)|Amazing Grace]]" was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref name="Library of Congress">{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-029/ | title=National Recording Registry Picks Are "Over the Rainbow" | work=Library of Congress | date=March 29, 2016 | access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> That same year, she received a Grammy Award nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album|Best Folk Album]] for ''[[Silver Skies Blue]]'' with [[Ari Hest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/features/singer-judy-collins-grammy-nomination-1201979543/ |title=Judy Collins Talks Her First Grammy Nomination in 40 Years: 'I've Been Working All This Time |work=Variety.com |date=February 8, 2017 |access-date=October 27, 2017}}</ref> In 2019 at the age of 80, she scored her first No. 1 album on an American ''Billboard'' Chart with ''[[Winter Stories (album)|Winter Stories]]'', a duet album with Norwegian singer, songwriter, and guitarist [[Jonas Fjeld]] featuring [[Chatham County Line]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546731/judy-collins-first-career-billboard-number-one-winter-stories/item/prn-17-029/ | title= Judy Scores First Career Number 1 | magazine= Billboard | date=June 13, 2020 | access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> In 2022, she released her first studio album of all original material, titled ''[[Spellbound (Judy Collins album)|Spellbound]]'', and it earned her another Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album.

==Early life==
Collins was born the eldest of five siblings in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] where she lived for the first ten years of her life. Her father, Chuck Collins (a [[visual impairment|blind]] singer, pianist, and radio show host) took a job in [[Denver]] in 1949 and the family moved there. Her grandfather on her father's side was Irish.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ellie |last=O'Byrne |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30977085.html |title=The songs that matter most to Judy Collins from her 60-year career |newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]] |issn=1393-9564 |location=Cork |language=en-ie |date=January 22, 2020 |access-date=March 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.irishmusicdaily.com/blog/judy-collins-on-her-love-of-irish-music |title=Judy Collins speaks about her love of Irish music |first=Patrick |last=Kehoe |date=November 29, 2021 |website=irishmusicdaily.com}}</ref> 

Judy Collins contracted [[polio]] at the age of 11 and spent two months in isolation in a hospital.<ref>{{cite web|author=Interview by Wendy Schuman|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Celebrities/Judy-Collins-Tell-The-Truth-No-Matter-How-Hard.aspx|title=Judy Collins tells Beliefnet how she used meditation and prayer to cope with illness and her son's suicide.|publisher=Beliefnet.com|date=February 17, 2011|access-date=October 16, 2012}}</ref> She grew up listening to the [[Irish traditional music|traditional Irish music]] her father sang. She did not know what folk music was when she was young. She said, "I just thought it was probably [[Rodgers and Hart]]. Those were the songs he (her father) sang on the radio. I didn't understand until I discovered [[The Whistling Gypsy|''The Gypsy Rover'']] and [[Barbara Allen (song)|''Barbara Allen'']] when I was 15. I didn't realize I had been singing ''[[Danny Boy]]'' all of that time... ''Danny Boy'' was a folk song.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://irishmusicdaily.com/blog/judy-collins-on-her-love-of-irish-music |title=Judy Collins Speaks About Her Love of Irish Music|first=Patrick|last=Kehoe|date=November 29, 2021|access-date=June 6, 2024|website=irishmusicdaily.com}}</ref>

==Career==
===Beginnings===
[[File:Judy Collins Hootenanny 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|Collins during a 1963 appearance on ''[[Hootenanny (TV series)|Hootenanny]]'']]
Collins studied classical piano with [[Antonia Brico]], making her public debut at age 13 performing [[Piano Concerto No. 10 (Mozart)|Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos]]. She also played [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] as a child.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ellie|last=O'Byrne |url=https://irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30977085.html|title=The Songs that Matter Most to Judy Collins from Her 60-year Career|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|issn=1393-9564 |location=Cork|language=en-ie|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=June 6, 2024}}</ref> Brico took a dim view of her developing interest in folk music, which led her to the difficult decision to discontinue her piano lessons. Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico to one of her concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins' hands into hers, looked wistfully at her fingers and said, "Little Judy—you really could have gone places." Still later, she discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing [[jazz]] and [[ragtime]] piano (''Singing Lessons'', pp.&nbsp;71–72). In her early life, she met many professional musicians through her father.<ref>{{cite book|last=Malkoski|first=Paul A.|title=The Denver Folk Music Tradition: An Unplugged History, from Harry Tuft to Swallow Hill and Beyond|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1609495329|page=52}}</ref>

It was the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Pete Seeger]] and the [[Folk music|traditional]] songs of the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] of the early 1960s, however, that kindled Collins' interest and awoke in her a love for [[lyrics]]. Three years after her debut as a piano [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], she was playing guitar. Her first public appearances as a folk artist after her graduation from Denver's East High School were at Michael's Pub in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and the folk club Exodus in Denver. Her music became popular at the [[University of Connecticut]], where her husband taught. She performed at parties and for the campus radio station along with [[David Grisman]] and Tom Azarian.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,526497,00.html|title=Time "Striking a Chord"|website=Time.com|access-date=August 20, 2021|archive-date=March 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319133053/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,526497,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===1960s===
Collins eventually made her way to [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]] where she played in clubs like Gerde's Folk City until she signed with [[Elektra Records]], a label she was associated with for 35 years. In 1961, she released her debut studio album, ''[[A Maid of Constant Sorrow]]'', at age 22.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reviews of new albums|date=November 27, 1961|magazine=Billboard|page=28}}</ref>

At first, Collins sang traditional folk songs or songs written by others–in particular the protest songwriters of the time, such as [[Tom Paxton]], [[Phil Ochs]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. She recorded her own versions of important songs from the period, such as Dylan's "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" and [[Pete Seeger]]'s "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]". She was also instrumental in bringing little-known musicians to a wider public. For example, she recorded songs by Canadian poet [[Leonard Cohen]], who became a close friend over the years. She also recorded songs by singer-songwriters such as [[Eric Andersen]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Robin Williamson]], and [[Richard Fariña]] long before they gained national acclaim.<ref>{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Sylvie|title=I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen|year=2012|publisher=McClelland & Stewart|isbn=978-0771080401}}</ref><ref name=newman>{{cite book|last=Courrier|first=Kevin|author-link=Kevin Courrier|title=Randy Newman: American Dreams|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1550226904|pages=65–66}}</ref>

[[File:JodyCollins-Oct1965.jpg|thumb|right|Judy Collins in 1965]]
Collins' first few studio albums consisted of straightforward guitar-based folk songs, but with her fifth studio album ''[[In My Life (Judy Collins album)|In My Life]]'' (1966), she began branching out to include works from such diverse sources as [[the Beatles]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Jacques Brel]], and [[Kurt Weill]].<ref name=newman/> [[Mark Abramson]] produced and [[Joshua Rifkin]] arranged the album, adding lush [[orchestration]] to many of the numbers. The album was a major departure for a folk artist and set the course for Collins' subsequent work over the next decade.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000195828|label=''In My Life'' review|access-date=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

With her sixth studio album ''[[Wildflowers (Judy Collins album)|Wildflowers]]'' (1967), also produced by Abramson and arranged by Rifkin, Collins began to record her own compositions, beginning with "Since You Asked". The album also provided her with a major hit and a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] in Mitchell's "[[Both Sides, Now]]", which in December 1968 reached No. 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=judy collins|chart=all}} |title=Judy Collins|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=March 16, 2013}}</ref> later (February 1970) reaching No. 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19700222/7501/|title=Official [U.K.] Singles Chart Top 50, 22 February 1970–28 February 1970|publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|access-date=December 17, 2021}}</ref>

Collins' seventh studio album ''[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes (Judy Collins album)|Who Knows Where the Time Goes]]'' (1968) was produced by [[David Anderle]], and featured back-up guitar by [[Stephen Stills]] (of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]]), with whom she was romantically involved at the time. (She was the inspiration for Stills's CSN classic "[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]".) ''Time Goes'' had a mellow [[country music|country]] sound and included [[Ian Tyson]]'s "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]" and the title track, written by the UK singer-songwriter [[Sandy Denny]]. The album also featured Collins' composition "My Father" and one of the first covers of Leonard Cohen's "[[Bird on the Wire]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Judy Collins Concert: Has Fans Gentle on Her Mind|date=May 24, 1969|magazine=Billboard|page=22}}</ref>

Two of Collins' songs ("[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes?]]" composed by Sandy Denny and "Albatross") were featured in the 1968 film ''[[The Subject Was Roses (film)|The Subject Was Roses]]''.

===1970s===
By the 1970s, Collins had a solid reputation as an [[art song]] singer and folksinger and had begun to stand out for her own compositions. She was also known for her broad range of material: her songs from this period include the traditional Christian [[hymn]] "[[Amazing Grace]]", the [[Stephen Sondheim]] [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] [[ballad]] "[[Send in the Clowns]]" (both of which were top 20 hits as singles in both the U.S. and the U.K.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/13893/judy-collins/|title=JUDY COLLINS|publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|access-date=December 17, 2021}}</ref>), a recording of [[Joan Baez]]'s "[[One Day at a Time (Joan Baez album)|A Song for David]]", and her own compositions, such as "Born to the Breed".<ref>{{cite news|last=Santosuosso|first=Ernie|title=Judy Collins' flight of fancy|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=May 11, 1975}}</ref>

In 1971, Collins issued her second live album, ''[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]'', and the compilation album ''[[Colors of the Day: The Best of Judy Collins]]'' followed a year later. Collins' ninth studio album ''[[True Stories and Other Dreams]]'' (1973) found her in a contemplative mood, featuring an original song about a friend who took his own life ("Song for Martin") and another about the life of Argentine [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] ("Che"). For her tenth studio album ''[[Judith (album)|Judith]]'' (1975), she collaborated with producer [[Arif Mardin]], who gave the album a sophisticated sound. ''Judith'' produced her biggest hit single with her mournful version of Stephen Sondheim's "[[Send in the Clowns]]", and it would become her best-selling record, eventually going platinum.

As Collins stepped up to a higher level of stardom, the longtime activist put political themes at the forefront of her eleventh studio album  ''[[Bread and Roses (album)|Bread and Roses]]'' (1976). Political statements like the title song, originally a poem by [[James Oppenheim]] commonly associated with a 1912 [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|garment workers strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], were balanced with such pop compositions as [[Elton John]]'s "Come Down in Time", but the album failed to achieve the commercial success of ''Judith''. Following the release of the album, Collins underwent treatment for damaged vocal cords, and after years of struggling with alcoholism, she sought medical help to give up drinking. Her compilation album ''[[So Early in the Spring (Judy Collins album)|So Early in the Spring... The First 15 Years]]'' (1977) sold modestly.

Collins guest starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in an episode broadcast in January 1978,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0786442591|page=[https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218 218]|url=https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218}}</ref> singing "[[Leather-Winged Bat]]", "[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]", "[[Do-Re-Mi]]", and "Send in the Clowns". She also appeared several times on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', where she performed "Fishermen's Song" with a chorus of [[Anything Muppet]] fishermen, sang a trio with [[Biff and Sully]] using the word "yes", and even starred in a modern musical fairy tale skit called "The Sad Princess".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ann|first=Lolordo|title=Judy Collins changing styles|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=August 13, 1977}}</ref> In 1979, she returned to music with her twelfth studio album ''[[Hard Times for Lovers]]'', a pop-oriented album in the same vein as ''Judith''; she gained some extra publicity with the cover sleeve photograph of her in the nude.

===1980s===
''[[Running for My Life]]'' (1980) and ''[[Times of Our Lives (Judy Collins album)|Times of Our Lives]]'' (1982) were well-crafted exercises in adult pop and soft rock, but as tastes changed, Collins' sales were on the decline. ''[[Home Again (Judy Collins album)|Home Again]]'' (1984) found her exploring some new musical avenues, including a synth-based cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz's]] "Only You" and a duet with country star [[T. G. Sheppard]] on the title cut. While the "Home Again" single was a minor hit, the album was not, and after 23 years, Collins and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] parted ways. She performed the music for the 1983 animated television special ''[[The Magic of Herself the Elf]]'', as well as the theme song of the [[Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment|Rankin/Bass Productions]] television film ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1987 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woolery|first=George W.|title=Animated TV Specials|year=1989|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810821989|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool}}</ref>

[[File:Judy Collins.jpg|thumb|Collins at a book signing, 1995|left]]
Collins traveled to England in 1985 and struck a one-off deal with Telstar Records to record the studio album ''[[Amazing Grace (Judy Collins album)|Amazing Grace]]'', in which she re-recorded several of her better-known songs with an inspirational bent. In 1987, she signed with the independent [[Gold Castle Records|Gold Castle]] label, and her first studio album for them, ''[[Trust Your Heart]]'', which collected seven tracks from ''Amazing Grace'' and added three new selections. That same year, she released her first memoir, ''Trust Your Heart''.<ref name="judycollins.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.judycollins.com/books|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211121113722/http://www.judycollins.com/books|url-status=live|archive-date=November 21, 2021|title=Judy Collins Official Website – Books|access-date=March 11, 2022}}</ref>

==Activism==
Like many other folk singers of her generation, Collins was drawn to social activism. Her political idealism led her to compose a ballad, ''Che,'' in honor of the 1960s [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/friday/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/friday/124591870160950.xml&coll=2 Collins doesn't rest on laurels but looks for songs' surprises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607160541/http://www.cleveland.com/friday/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Ffriday%2F124591870160950.xml&coll=2 |date=June 7, 2011 }} by John Soeder, ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', June 26, 2009</ref> Collins sympathized with the [[Youth International Party|Yippie]] movement and was friendly with its leaders, [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]]. On March 17, 1968, she went to Hoffman's press conference at the Americana Hotel in New York to announce the party's formation. In 1969, she testified in [[Chicago]] in support of the [[Chicago Seven]]; during her testimony, she began singing [[Pete Seeger]]'s "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" and was admonished by prosecutor [[Tom Foran]] and judge [[Julius Hoffman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chicago7/Collins.html|title=Testimony of Judy Collins in the Chicago Seven Trial|publisher=Law.umkc.edu|date=August 19, 1968|access-date=September 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619235723/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/Collins.html|archive-date=June 19, 2010}}</ref>

Collins suffered from [[bulimia nervosa]] after she quit smoking in the 1970s. "I went straight from the cigarettes into an [[eating disorder]]", she told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine in 1992. "I started throwing up. I didn't know anything about bulimia, certainly not that it is an addiction or that it would get worse. My feelings about myself, even though I had been able to give up smoking and lose 20 pounds, were of increasing despair." 

She wrote at length of her years of addiction to alcohol, the damage it did to her personal and musical life and how it contributed to her feelings of depression.<ref>{{cite book|first=Judy|last=Collins|title=Singing lessons: a memoir of love, loss, hope and healing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBIJPmrOwNMC&pg=PA127|access-date=November 16, 2010|date=October 1998|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-00397-5|pages=172–190, 238–240}}</ref> She admits that although she tried other drugs in the 1960s, alcohol had always been her drug of first choice just as it had been for her father. She entered a rehabilitation program in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1978 and has maintained her sobriety ever since, even through such traumatic events as the death of her only child, Clark, by suicide in 1992 at age 33 after a long bout with clinical depression and substance abuse. Since then, she has also become an activist for suicide prevention.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-06-18-judy-collins_n.htm | title=Son's suicide prodded Collins to write | newspaper=USA Today | date=June 18, 2007 | access-date=November 25, 2013 | author=Hellmich, Nanci}}</ref>
