==Music career==

===1995–1996: ''Jeff Carson''===
Carson's debut single, "Yeah Buddy", was released in early 1995, peaking at number 69 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart. It was followed by "[[Not on Your Love]]", which became his only number one later that year.<ref name="allmusic"/> Both singles were included on his debut album, titled ''[[Jeff Carson (album)|Jeff Carson]]'', which produced two more Top Ten hits in "[[The Car (song)|The Car]]" (number 3) and "[[Holdin' Onto Something]]" (number 6), the latter of which was previously recorded by [[John Michael Montgomery]]. Between those two singles was a Christmas release called "Santa Got Lost in Texas" (number 70), The album's last single was "That Last Mile" at number 62.<ref name="whitburn"/> In 1996, Carson won the [[Academy of Country Music]]’s Video of the Year for "The Car". He also co-wrote the song "Whoop-De-Do" on [[Keith Gattis]]' 1996 [[Keith Gattis (album)|self-titled debut]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Keith Gattis |others=Keith Gattis |year=1996 |type=CD insert |publisher=RCA Records |id=66834}}</ref> ''Jeff Carson'' received a mixed review from ''[[Country Standard Time]]'', whose Larry Stephens said that "Carson's songs are all good, but nothing sticks or grabs the heart strings."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1354|title=''Jeff Carson'' review|last=Stephens|first=Larry|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref>

===1997–1999: ''Butterfly Kisses''===
Carson released his second album in 1997. Entitled ''[[Butterfly Kisses (Jeff Carson album)|Butterfly Kisses]]'', this album produced four singles, none of which reached top 40: "Do It Again" at number 55; the album's title track (number 62), which was also a number 1 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] hit and minor country hit for [[Bob Carlisle]] as well as a Top 40 pop and country hit for the [[Raybon Brothers]]; "Here's the Deal" (number 64); and "Cheatin' on Her Heart" (number 52).<ref name="whitburn"/> This album also included an alternative mix of "Butterfly Kisses" which combined elements of labelmate [[Kippi Brannon]]'s then-current single "Daddy's Little Girl", as well as a duet with [[Merle Haggard]] on a rendition of his hit "Today I Started Loving You Again".<ref name="oldies"/>

===1998–2002: ''Real Life''===
His eleventh single, "Shine On", was released in 1998. After it, too, failed to reach Top 40, Carson's third album was repeatedly delayed. "Scars and All" did not reach the country charts, but was a number 1 on the PowerSource Christian charts. Following it in 2001 was his first Top 40 country single in five years, "[[Real Life (I Never Was the Same Again)]]". It reached number 14 at the end of the year,<ref name="whitburn"/> and was followed by the release of his third studio album, also called ''[[Real Life (Jeff Carson album)|Real Life]]''. In 2002, Carson suffered a broken vertebra in a sledding accident at home. Although he briefly spent some time in a body cast, he was not seriously injured.<ref name="home">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1452246/20020211/carson_jeff.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033555/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1452246/20020211/carson_jeff.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Carson Goes Home |accessdate=July 19, 2007 |publisher=Country Music Television}}</ref> Another single from ''Real Life'', entitled "Until We Fall Back in Love Again", peaked at number 47.<ref name="Billboard p. 46">{{cite book | title=Billboard | date=April 6, 2002 | publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | issn=0006-2510 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA46 | access-date=March 28, 2022 | page=46}}</ref>

===2003–2022:  Return to music and police work===
Carson charted again in 2003 with his cover of the Christian pop hit "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]", a cut from a multi-artist compilation called ''God Bless the USA 2003''.<ref name="Tree 2022">{{cite web | title=God Bless The USA 2003 – Best of America Vol 3 | website=Curb | date=March 29, 2022 | url=https://www.curb.com/store/albums/1549/ | access-date=March 29, 2022}}</ref> He also co-wrote the track "Where Has My Hometown Gone" on [[Craig Morgan (singer)|Craig Morgan]]'s album ''[[I Love It (album)|I Love It]]'', as well as [[Elbert West]]'s single "Kimberly Cooper's Eyes".
