'''Harmony James'''  is an Australian singer-songwriter. Although James is often classified as a country artist, her music draws on many genres, including [[folk music|folk]], pop, rock and [[blues music|blues]]. In 2006 Harmony first came to the attention of the music industry when she became the only Australian songwriter to have won the country category of the International Songwriting Competition, with her song "Tailwind".<ref name="update" /> Her second single, "Somebody Stole My Horse",  became Australian radio's second most played country song in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Herm Kovac Productions|url=http://www.ramrodstudio.com/Herm%20kovac.html|work=Ramrod Studio|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> spawned 

==Early life==
Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia to a [[Baptist]] preacher as one of twelve children, Harmony went to a private school and says she had "few friends".<ref name="courier" /> She read voraciously, eventually discovering the western novels of [[Louis L'Amour]].<ref name=update>{{cite journal|title=Tailwind or Tornado?|journal=Country Update|issue=54|url=http://www.countryupdate.com.au/images/stories/cu54/01_harmony_james.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> James discovered traditional country music after a friend returned from [[Texas]] with records by [[Dolly Parton]] and [[The Judds]].<ref name="courier" /> Soon after, James taught herself enough guitar to learn a few country songs and took to the streets singing to earn money.

She later ran a stock camp in the outback of [[Queensland]] and worked with cattle on the [[Northern Territory]]'s [[Barkly Tableland]]. She left home to work as a [[Jillaroo (trainee)|jillaroo]] at some of the most remote cattle stations in southwestern Queensland,<ref name="update" /> "covered in mud and blood, roughing it with the guys, working so hard I had biceps and thinking, 'This is not what my mother pictured for me'." A gig at a school fete in [[Goondiwindi]] led to an offer from the local publican and Harmony's songbook started filling, even as she continued her parallel life on the land, from the Cape to [[Tennant Creek]], studying agriculture at [[The University of Queensland]] at [[Gatton, Queensland|Gatton]]<ref name="courier" /> and working as a welder "in a shed of 80 blokes."<ref name=capital>{{cite news|last=Jarvis|first=Susan|title=Complete Harmony|url=http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=1614&issue=117|access-date=1 December 2012|newspaper=Capital News|date=July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427073019/http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=1614&issue=117|archive-date=27 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> "My musical exposure was mostly church music until I got a job as a checkout chick and heard the radio," she says. "Now when I hang out with other musos they'll drop names and I'll just look at them blankly 'cause my music history starts in '95."<ref name=alberts>{{cite web|title=Harmony James|url=http://albertmusic.com/musicians/harmony-james|work=Alberts|publisher=Alberts Pty Ltd.|accessdate=1 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905235752/http://albertmusic.com/musicians/harmony-james|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Harmony opened for and performed with Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell on their Australian tour in 2015. ''The Courier Mail''<nowiki/>'s Noel Mengel reviewed the show, saying about James' set, "When someone shines while singing alongside Emmylou Harris, you know that's a truly great singer. If you love this kind of music, you really need to check her out."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mengel |first=Noel |date=2 July 2015 |title=Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell shine at Jupiters gig |url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/confidential/emmylou-harris-and-rodney-crowell-shine-at-jupiters-gig/news-story/0d574ce0f6d1fa5523e0da51f8e8f34a |website=The Courier Mail}}</ref> 

In late 2018, James' official Facebook page announced a new independent album ''Resignation''. It was produced by Glen Hannah, music critic Bernard Zuel published a favourable review of the record, suggesting "James might be earning the right to be counted among the likes of the more experienced Gretchen Peters and Rosanne Cash".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zuel |first=Bernard |date=2019-01-30 |title=Harmony James - Resignation: Review |url=https://www.bernardzuel.net/post/2019/01/31/harmony-james-resignation-review |access-date=2022-02-26 |website=Bernard Zuel |language=en}}</ref> The ''Sunburnt Country Music'' blog said "despite its title, ''Resignation'' is not an album that sounds like defeat, retreat or weariness â€“ it is a glorious manifestation of James's skills and talent, and it has been worth waiting for".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-02-18 |title=Album review: Resignation by Harmony James |url=https://sunburntcountrymusic.com/2019/02/18/album-review-resignation-by-harmony-james/ |access-date=2022-02-26 |website=Sunburnt Country Music |language=en}}</ref>
