Six months later, in January 2014, Duddy called Carson and Wystrach to suggest that they record some songs,<ref name=tribeza /> and they went to the [[Sonic Ranch]] recording studio in El Paso, TX to record for 10 days. As stated by Mark Wystrach, "when we went to the Sonic Ranch, we became a band.

[[File:Midland in concert - Cameron Duddy.jpg|upright|thumb|Cameron Duddy in 2019]]
Cameron Duddy started playing music after a difficult situation in his family; he found that music helped to lessen the tension, saying, "Sometimes you don't get to talk about all the things that you maybe want to talk about and the ice breaker started to be music." He got his first guitar from his father; it helped him to find his identity.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2017/02/20/whos-new-midland/|title=Who's New: Midland|date=2017-02-20|work=Nash Country Daily|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170702054247/http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2017/02/20/whos-new-midland/ |archive-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref>
