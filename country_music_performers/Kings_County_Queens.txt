==Reviews==
[[Country Standard Time]]'s Clarissa Sansone wrote that ''Big Ideas'' "...tips its hat to the city with its sometimes streetwise lyrics, but overall the sound is old-fashioned: a ukulele tune on a moonlit boat ride flavored with rockabilly riffs."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1692 |title=Kings County Queens - Big Ideas |last=Sansone |first=Clarissa |website=Country Standard Time |access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref> Writing for ''[[the Village Voice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, writing, "Beneath their warm country-folk exterior lurks bitter urban-folk experience".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=2002-05-14 |title=Nothing Major |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/05/14/nothing-major/ |magazine=The Village Voice}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=kings+county+queens |title=Robert Christgau: CG: kings county queens |website=robertchristgau.com |access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref> [[AllMusic]]'s Rick Anderson gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing that "Kings County Queens are urbanites, all right, but the love they bring to this repertoire feels sincere, their stylistic command is genuine, and, most importantly, the music they make is lots of fun."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/big-ideas-mw0000218183 |title=Big Ideas - Kings County Queens |last=Anderson |first=Rick |website=AllMusic |access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>
