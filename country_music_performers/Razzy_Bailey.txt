'''Rasie Michael Bailey''' (February 14, 1939 – August 4, 2021), better known as '''Razzy Bailey''', was an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter and musician. In the early 1980s, he scored 5 No. 1's on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' country music charts.

==Early life==
Bailey was born in [[Five Points, Alabama]], United States,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and raised on a farm in [[La Fayette, Alabama]]. Bailey got his first experience of musical performance as a member of his high school's [[Future Farmers of America]] string band. After graduation, he married and had children immediately and had little time to pursue his career,<ref name="AMG" /> but he spent many years playing occasional gigs at honkytonks in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and Alabama and developing his songwriting.

==Early releases==
In 1966, Bailey took his material to [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] at [[Atlantic Records]], who arranged for him to record "9,999,999 Tears" backed by a studio band featuring [[Billy Joe Royal]], [[Joe South]], and [[Freddy Weller]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The song failed to hit the charts at that time, but Bailey was encouraged, forming the pop trio Daily Bread which released a pair of albums on small labels.<ref name="AMG">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/razzy-bailey-mn0000869042/biography|title=Razzy Bailey &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 4, 2021}}</ref> Another group, The Aquarians, followed in 1972; in 1974, Bailey recorded the album ''I Hate Hate'' simply as "Razzy." It sold over half a million copies before being picked up by [[MGM Records]]. 

==Career at RCA==
In 1976, [[Dickey Lee]] recorded "9,999,999 Tears", and it became a country and pop hit in 1976,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and in 1977, Lee repeated this with another Bailey tune, "Peanut Butter," which also went into the charts.<ref name="AMG"/> As his songwriting talents became known, Bailey signed with [[RCA Records]] and, in 1978, began releasing singles of his own songs.<ref name="AMG"/> His first hit as a singer-songwriter, "What Time Do You Have To Be Back in Heaven?",<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> was on the charts for over four months. Bailey charted a total of seven No. 1 singles on [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']]'s [[Hot Country Songs|"Country" charts]] and another eight Top 10 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His sound combines [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] influences with country; his version of [[Wilson Pickett]]'s "[[In the Midnight Hour]]" was a country hit.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His last country No.&nbsp;1 hit was with "[[She Left Love All Over Me]]" in 1982.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Bailey had three double sided number 1's in succession on the Country chart,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> a feat never accomplished by any other artist.

He also operated Razzy's Hit House, his recording studio where he helped other artists with their projects.

==Personal life==
Bailey died in August 2021, at the age of 82.<ref>[https://www.wideopencountry.com/razzy-bailey '80s Hitmaker Razzy Bailey Dies at Age 82], ''Wideopencountry.com''</ref>
