==Background==
Philomena Begley was born and grew up in [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland,<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=209}}</ref> and worked in a hat factory in [[Cookstown]] before her break into music.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

==Career==
Her first venture as a singer was with the popular Old Cross Céilí Band, with whom she sang as a dare, but stayed with the group.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The group soon became known as the Old Cross Bandshow and released three records in Ireland in 1968 and 1969, but none made an impression in the chart. In September 1970, the band changed its name to The Country Flavour.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Begley's first record following this became her first chart hit when "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" reached number seven in the Irish chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement?page=4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721125301/http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement?page=4|url-status=dead|title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know|archivedate=21 July 2011|website=Irishcharts.ie}}</ref> In 1974, she formed the Ramblin' Men,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> while the Country Flavour continued to tour with several other lead singers (including Eileen King and Dan O'Hara) during the 1970s.

Begley regularly toured with [[Ray Lynam]] from 1975 and they recorded many duets together, probably their most popular being "My Elusive Dreams",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which went on to be mentioned in [[The Pogues]]' song, "[[A Pair of Brown Eyes]]".

In 1975, Begley had a hit with her version of [[Billie Jo Spears]]' hit song "[[Blanket on the Ground]]" which took her to number five in the Irish chart.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Spears also released the song in the United Kingdom and in [[Ireland (state)|Ireland]] at the same time, but in Ireland, Begley's version received the highest sales, as Spears' version only went to number 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iangallagher.com/philomenabegley.html |title=Philomenabegley |website=Iangallagher.com |access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref> Begley occasionally performed with Spears and later recorded a tribute song to her after the American star's death in 2011. 

By 1977, she was undertaking a major tour of the United States, and in 1978, she was invited to sing at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] by [[Porter Wagoner]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Since then, she has returned annually to [[Nashville]], been a guest of honour at the [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade in New York City, and has sung at both the Grand Ole Opry and [[Carnegie Hall]].  Although few of Begley's CDs have been released in the United States, a number are available for downloading on the site Freegal Music.
