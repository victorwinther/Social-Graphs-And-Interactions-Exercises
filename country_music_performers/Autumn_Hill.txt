'''Autumn Hill''' was a Canadian [[country music]] duo composed of Mike Robins (from [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]) and Tareya Green (from [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Autumn Hill Biography|url=http://www.cmt.ca/artist/autumn-hill/|work=[[CMT (Canada)|CMT]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|archive-date=December 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203051451/http://www.cmt.ca/artist/autumn-hill/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==

Green studied multi-media at [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]] in [[Calgary, Alberta]] and was developing websites for entertainers, but she was a songwriter and pianist and began posting performances on YouTube, where Wax Records co-founder Jamie Appleby discovered her. In January 2012, she moved to Toronto, where Appleby brought in several songwriters to co-write what was meant to be her first album. One of those songwriters was Mike Robins. Robins was an established singer/songwriter who had spent 2010 touring with [[Hope Sandoval]] then had his 2011 solo single "No Mercy"<ref>{{cite web |title=MIKE ROBINS - No Mercy |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MATAdMbHU1I |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=17 January 2022}}</ref> top the [[adult contemporary]] chart on [[iHeartRadio]].{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} When Appleby heard the two singing together, he saw their potential as a duet and Autumn Hill was born.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Volmers |first1=Eric |title=On her own: Calgary-born Tareya...Mar 2018 |url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/music/on-her-own-calgary-born-tareya-finds-a-new-voice-away-from-autumn-hill |website=calgaryherald.com |publisher=Calgary Herald |access-date=17 January 2022}}</ref>

Their debut single, "[[Anything At All]]," entered the [[Canadian Hot 100]] in January 2013.<ref name="acharts">{{cite web|title=Autumn Hill - Music Charts|url=http://acharts.us/performer/autumn_hill|work=acharts.us|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref> It is included on their debut album ''[[Favourite Mistake]]'', released September 10, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pederson|first=Casadie|title=Fresh Find: Autumn Hill|url=http://topcountry.ca/fresh-find-autumn-hill/|accessdate=January 18, 2013|newspaper=Top Country|date=January 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Vince|title=Autumn Hill ready to climb|url=http://www.camrosecanadian.com/2013/08/01/autumn-hill-ready-to-climb|publisher=Camrose Canadian News|accessdate=20 August 2013|archive-date=14 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214075018/http://www.camrosecanadian.com/2013/08/01/autumn-hill-ready-to-climb|url-status=dead}}</ref> With two of their singles gaining substantial airplay on both country and [[adult contemporary]] formats, the pair were touted as the first Canadian country act since [[Shania Twain]] to successfully [[crossover (music)|crossover]] to pop radio.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheevers|first1=Melinda|title=Autumn Hill ready to rock Brock's Centre for the Arts|url=http://www.niagarathisweek.com/whatson-story/5028020-autumn-hill-ready-to-rock-brock-s-centre-for-the-arts/|accessdate=14 February 2015|work=Niagara This Week|publisher=Metroland Media|date=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Banerjee|first1=Nilabjo|title=Interview: Autumn Hill|url=http://ridethetempo.com/2014/11/27/interview-autumn-hill/|accessdate=14 February 2015|publisher=Ride the Tempo|date=27 November 2014|archive-date=14 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214074918/http://ridethetempo.com/2014/11/27/interview-autumn-hill/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The record's three subsequent singles experienced diminishing returns on the [[Canada Country]] airplay chart; the third single "[[Fire (Autumn Hill song)|Fire]]" became the group's highest-charting entry on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] at number 73. "[[Blame (Autumn Hill song)|Blame]]" was released in March 2015 as the lead single for the group's second and final album, ''[[Anchor (Autumn Hill album)|Anchor]]''. Reaching a peak position of four on the Canadian country airplay chart, it remains the group's only top ten hit. In total, seven of their singles charted.

In 2017, at the end of their promotion for ''Anchor'', the pair decided to split up and pursue solo careers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Volmers |first1=Eric |title=On her own: Calgary-born Tareya...Mar 2018 |url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/music/on-her-own-calgary-born-tareya-finds-a-new-voice-away-from-autumn-hill |website=calgaryherald.com |publisher=Calgary Herald |access-date=17 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tareya - About|url=https://www.tareyaofficial.com/about|publisher=Tareya Official|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
