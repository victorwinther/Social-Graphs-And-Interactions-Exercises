'''Larry Cunningham''' (13 February 1938 – 28 September 2012)<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2012b.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 2012 July To December |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |access-date=29 September 2012}}</ref> was an [[Country and Irish|Irish country music]] singer, who was one of the leading figures of the [[showband]] scene in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/the-nostalgia-twostep-338783.html|title=The nostalgia two-step|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=14 July 2001|access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> Cunningham accomplished a series of "firsts" during his career. In 1964, Cunningham broke into the British charts with "Tribute to [[Jim Reeves]]", the first time an Irish artist had done such a thing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19771095|title=Irish showband singer Larry Cunningham dies|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 September 2012|access-date=29 September 2012}}</ref>

==Biography==
Cunningham grew up in the townland of Clooneen in [[Mullinalaghta]] parish, near [[Granard]], [[County Longford]], in a farming family of seven children.<ref name=larrybio>{{cite web|url=http://larrycunningham.ie/biography.html|title=Biography|first=Larry|last=Cunningham|access-date=22 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115023230/http://larrycunningham.ie/biography.html|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> After leaving school at 16 he went to England and worked as a [[carpenter]], playing [[Irish traditional music]] and [[gaelic football]] during his spare time. In 1958 he returned to Ireland. Still working as a carpenter, he soon joined the part-time [[Gowna]]-based Grafton Showband, but left it in 1961 to become fully professional as the lead singer of the Mighty Avons, based in [[Cavan]]. That band initially specialised in covers of [[Jim Reeves]] songs and similar country material.

The band's first taste of fame came when they were supporting Jim Reeves during the Irish leg of his European tour in 1963; when Reeves walked off the stage during a concert in [[Lifford]] in protest at the poor condition of the supplied [[piano]], the Avons (as they later became popularly called) took over and entertained the crowd, to much subsequent publicity and acclaim.<ref name=larrybio /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://iangallagher.com/mightyavons.html|title=The Mighty Avons|first=Ian|last=Gallagher|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/itemdetail.asp?itemID=12742&menu=d12742 |title=Larry Cunningham in Rooskey |newspaper=Roscommon People |access-date=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005165838/http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/itemdetail.asp?itemID=12742&menu=d12742 |archive-date=5 October 2011 }}</ref>

In December 1964, Cunningham and the Mighty Avons had a [[Irish Singles Chart|Top-10 hit]] with the song "Tribute to Jim Reeves", which also entered the British charts<ref>{{cite news|title=Larry Cunningham to appear on Nationwide|newspaper=Longford Leader|date=18 March 2010}}</ref> (the first time for an Irish artiste),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/50-years-on-why-the-charts-still-no-1-293700.html|title=50 years on - why the chart's still No 1|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|first=Shay|last=Healy|author-link=Shay Healy|date=21 September 2002|access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> and played on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/hats-off-to-top-of-the-popsand-those-great-green-years-205401.html|title=Hats off to Top Of The Pops...and those great green years|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=18 September 2003|access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> (also an Irish first), which further boosted their career. Their major hit was "Lovely [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]]" in September 1965, which stayed at number one in the charts for four weeks. As well as regularly touring Ireland to large crowds, the Avons made many appearances on television, and often played in Britain, the US, and other places.

In late 1969, he left the Mighty Avons and merged with [[Edenderry]] band The Fairways to form Larry Cunningham and the Country Blue Boys, leaving [[Gene Stuart]] to front the Avons.<ref name=irishshowbands>{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-showbands.com/Bands/larryc.htm|title=Larry Cunningham Feature|publisher=irish-showbands.com|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> Cunningham continued having success with his new band, but after his marriage in 1972 he gave up regular touring in favour of occasional concerts and recording. He continued to have top-10 hits until the mid-1970s, and still performed occasionally for the remainder of his life. In recent years, audio and video compilations of his music have been released, as well as a biography.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.longfordleader.ie/news/local/a_lifetime_of_music_recalled_in_new_book_1_1955768 |title=A lifetime of music recalled in new book |newspaper=Longford Leader |date=25 August 2009 |access-date=24 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003084537/http://www.longfordleader.ie/news/local/a_lifetime_of_music_recalled_in_new_book_1_1955768 |archive-date=3 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.mentorbooks.ie/book.aspx?contentid=218|title=LarryCunningham: A Showband Legend|last=Gilmore|first=Tom|publisher=Mentor Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1-906623-39-5}}</ref>

In February 1972, Cunningham married Beatrice Nannery, who worked for him managing a supermarket which he owned. They had four children and two grandchildren. He died on 28 September 2012,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0929/death-of-singer-larry-cunningham-after-illness.html|title=Showband singer Larry Cunningham dies|work=[[RTÉ News]]|date=29 September 2012|access-date=29 September 2012}}</ref> following a long period of illness.<ref name=showband_legend_vows_to_gig_again>{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Sweeney|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/showband-legend-vows-to-gig-again-despite-illness-3060929.html|title=Showband legend vows to gig again despite illness|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=26 March 2012|access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref>
