'''Ricky Van Shelton''' (born January 12, 1952)<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rose |first=Mike|date=January 12, 2023 |title=Today's famous birthdays list for January 12, 2023 includes celebrities Howard Stern, Issa Rae|url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2023/01/todays-famous-birthdays-list-for-january-12-2023-includes-celebrities-howard-stern-issa-rae.html |access-date=January 12, 2023|website=[[Cleveland.com]]}}</ref> is an American retired [[country music]] singer. Active between 1986 and 2006, he charted more than 20 singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs charts. This figure includes 10 Number One hits: "[[Somebody Lied]]", "[[Life Turned Her That Way]]", '[[Don't We All Have the Right]]", "[[I'll Leave This World Loving You]]", "[[From a Jack to a King]]" (a cover of the [[Ned Miller]] hit), "[[Living Proof (Ricky Van Shelton song)|Living Proof]]", "[[I've Cried My Last Tear for You]]", "[[Rockin' Years]]" (a duet with [[Dolly Parton]]), "[[I Am a Simple Man]]", and "[[Keep It Between the Lines]]". Besides these, seven more of his singles landed in the Top 10 on the same chart. He also released nine studio albums, of which his first four were certified [[platinum album|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].

==Early life==
He was born at Danville Regional Medical Center in [[Danville, Virginia]], United States, to Jenks and Eloise Shelton in 1952,<ref>Official Site Bio "[http://rickyvanshelton.com/man.htm The Man]", Accessed July 18, 2007.</ref> but was raised in [[Grit, Virginia]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p124462|pure_url=yes}}|title=Ricky Van Shelton biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=26 August 2010}}</ref> and went to High school in [[Gretna, Virginia]].  Although "Van" is a common portion of surnames derived from people of Dutch origin, "Van" in this case is Shelton's middle name.

Shelton's father sang gospel music while he was still a child, and from this Shelton also sang gospel, but he also liked pop music. He was soon in church, singing gospel. When he was a teenager, however, Shelton discovered country music.<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=424}}</ref> He soon started singing in his brother's band, singing country music, and performed at any local gathering he could.

==Musical career==
===Move to Nashville===
After he graduated from high school, Shelton started performing in area clubs and also worked a series of jobs. In 1984, Bettye Witt, his girlfriend at the time (and, since August 4, 1986, wife) found a job in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and Shelton went along with her.<ref name="Larkin80"/> In Nashville, Shelton tried to land a deal with a recording contract, and worked in area nightclubs.  In 1986, Jerry Thompson, a newspaper columnist, heard one of Shelton's demos, and arranged an audition with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="Larkin80"/> Soon thereafter, Shelton was offered a recording contract with CBS, with Jerry Thompson serving as his manager. In that same year, he recorded his first album, ''[[Wild-Eyed Dream]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The title track was released as a single, and reached No.&nbsp;24 on the Country charts.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=366|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>

===1986–1988: ''Wild-Eyed Dream''===
''[[Wild-Eyed Dream]]'' became successful for Shelton and his record label. The next song from the album, "Crime of Passion" gained him an even bigger hit on the Country charts, when it reached the Top 10 early that year.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The follow-up was an even bigger success. This next song was called "Somebody Lied", and in December 1987 it became his first No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart.<ref name="Larkin80"/>  Nine other songs would make it to No.&nbsp;1 on the Country charts during his career.<ref name="Larkin80"/> He had a pair of other No.&nbsp;1 singles from his debut album: "Life Turned Her That Way" and "Don't We All Have the Right".<ref name="Larkin80"/> His album reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the Top Country Albums chart in 1987, was one of the biggest-selling Country albums of the year, and it made Shelton one of the most successful male vocalists of that year.

===1988–1989: ''Loving Proof''===
He achieved equal success the next year with a new album and a new single. The album was titled ''[[Loving Proof (album)|Loving Proof]]'', and it too was a No.&nbsp;1 Billboard Country album. The album spawned three No.&nbsp;1 hits for Shelton. These songs were, "I'll Leave This World Loving You" (for two weeks in November 1988), "From a Jack to a King" (in March 1989), and "[[Living Proof (Ricky Van Shelton song)|Living Proof]]" (in October 1989).<ref name="Larkin80"/> "From a Jack to a King" was a remake of the original by [[Ned Miller]].<ref name="Larkin80"/> By this time in country music, [[Neotraditional country|Neo-Traditionalism]] was in its peak, and because of this, so was Shelton's career, just like so many of his counterparts, like [[Clint Black]], [[George Strait]], [[Randy Travis]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]].

===1989–1991: ''RVS III'', Christmas album and children's books===
His albums continued to win him praise and keep him high on the charts. His third album was no different. Titled ''[[RVS III]]'', this album spawned only one No.&nbsp;1 single, called "I've Cried My Last Tear For You".<ref name="Larkin80"/> Although this was his only No.&nbsp;1 from the album, two singles came close, "Statue of a Fool" (originally recorded by [[Jack Greene]]) and "I Meant Every Word He Said", both of which reached number 2 on the Country charts. By now in his career, Shelton was one of Country music's most successful male vocalists. All his albums around this time had been certified by the [[RIAA]] as [[Platinum certification|Platinum]], and were also all No.&nbsp;1 albums on the "Top Country Albums" chart. In 1990, he recorded a Christmas album titled ''[[Ricky Van Shelton Sings Christmas]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/>

Around the same time, Shelton wrote a series of children's books. The first two titles of his books were, ''Tales From a Duck Named Quacker'' and ''Quacker Meets Mrs. Moo''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The series also contains "Quacker Meets Canadian Goose" and were all illustrated by Shan Williams Burklow.

===1991–1992: ''Backroads''===
Shelton continued his success as the decade began to progress. The next year, 1991, proved another successful year for Shelton. He duetted on the song, "[[Rockin' Years]]" with [[Dolly Parton]] (which also went to No.&nbsp;1), as well as a new album, titled, ''[[Backroads (Ricky Van Shelton album)|Backroads]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The album featured his last No.&nbsp;1 hits, along with a number 13 hit called "After the Lights Go Out". His hit streak continued up until this year, and his album was just as successful as his songs.

===1992–1993: ''Greatest Hits Plus'', ''Don't Overlook Salvation'' and alcoholism===
By 1992, Shelton's success on the country charts was tapering off and, like many others in the industry, he was swept out of popularity by the changes in country music that arrived in the early 1990s. He enjoyed one last Top 10 hit (which actually reached number 5) titled "Wild Man", which was put on his newest album, called ''Greatest Hits Plus''. Another single, "[[Just as I Am (Ricky Van Shelton song)|Just as I Am]]", was featured on his ''Greatest Hits'' album, but it only made the Top 30 that year. He also released a [[gospel music]] album titled ''[[Don't Overlook Salvation]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/>

In 1992, Shelton admitted that he suffered from alcoholism and sought help to recover his sobriety.

===1993–1994: ''Love and Honor'' and departure from Columbia===
By 1993, it was clear that Shelton was winding farther and farther away from the top ten on the Country charts. In 1994, he had his last top 40 hit with "Where Was I". After 1994's ''[[Love and Honor (Ricky Van Shelton album)|Love and Honor]]'' album, Shelton decided to leave Columbia Records.<ref name="Larkin80"/>

After being under Columbia Records, Shelton was absent from the Country chart for a long period of time. However, Columbia continued to release Greatest Hits collections to the public. Shelton continued to work on other projects during this time, which did not mean giving up performing.

===1997–1999: ''Making Plans'' and label formation===
In 1997, Shelton formed his own label, titled RVS Records. That same year, he released his first album in three years, titled ''[[Making Plans]]''. Shelton financed the project himself however, and worked out to release his album only to [[Wal-Mart]] stores.

===2000–2001: ''Fried Green Tomatoes''===
In 2000, Shelton signed with the Audium label, where he made another album called ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes (Ricky Van Shelton album)|Fried Green Tomatoes]]'',<ref name="Larkin80"/> which spawned his first single in over five years called "The Decision", but it failed to make a substantial impact on the Country chart.<ref name="whitburn"/>

===2006–present: Retirement===
In May 2006, Shelton announced that he would be retiring from touring to spend more time with his family.
