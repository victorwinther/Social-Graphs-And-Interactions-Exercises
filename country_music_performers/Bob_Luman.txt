'''Robert Glynn Luman''' (April 15, 1937 – December 27, 1978)<ref name="LarkinGE"/> was an American [[Country music|country]] and [[rockabilly]] singer-songwriter.

==Early life and career==
Luman was born in [[Blackjack, Texas|Blackjack]], Texas, United States,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> though was raised in [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], Texas.  His early interest in music was influenced by his father, an amateur [[fiddle]], [[guitar]] and [[harmonica]] player.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Bob Luman received his first guitar when he was thirteen years of age.<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/flu22|title=LUMAN, ROBERT GLYNN [BOB]|publisher=The Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association | date= September 2, 2008|access-date= September 2, 2008 }}</ref>

Luman attended high school in [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]], where the family had moved after young Bob's birth and started his first band while in high school.<ref name=TSHA/>

Luman had been a baseball star at his high school and tried out with the [[Major League Baseball]] [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], but when he did not make it in professional baseball, he decided to concentrate on his music.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In 1956, he won a [[talent contest]] promoted by the [[Future Farmers of America]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which earned him an appearance on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''.<ref name=TSHA/>

For the ''Hayride'', Luman formed a [[backup band]] called the Shadows, including [[James Burton]] on guitar, [[James Kirkland (musician)|James Kirkland]] on bass and Butch White on drums.  In 1957, the band signed with [[Imperial Records]], where they recorded "All Night Long" (b/w "Red Cadillac and a Black Mustache") and "Amarillo Blues."<ref name=TSHA/>

That same year, the band appeared on the ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' in Los Angeles, and appeared in the movie ''[[Carnival Rock]]'', where they backed up [[David Houston (singer)|David Houston]].<ref name=TSHA/>

The following year, having been dropped by Imperial Records, Luman signed with [[Capitol Records]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares."  Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name, which he refused to do, so he left the record label and signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta."<ref name=TSHA/>

In 1960, Luman was inducted into the [[United States Army]].  It was while still serving in the Army Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover [[chart-topper|hit]], "[[Let's Think About Living]],"<ref name="LarkinGE"/> a [[novelty song]] that hit No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] and No.&nbsp;9 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[country music]] chart.<ref name=TSHA/> It also reached the Top 10 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

After leaving the Army in 1962, Luman moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

On August 12, 1964, he married Barbara in Yuma, Colorado.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 1965, he joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=TSHA/>

==Later career==
Luman toured frequently in the 1960s and 1970s, and became popular in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], with an act that combined country and rockabilly.  He signed with [[Epic Records]] in 1968, and had several hits with them, including "[[Lonely Women Make Good Lovers]]" and "Still Loving You."<ref name=TSHA/>  "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" became his biggest country hit, hitting No.&nbsp;4 on the country chart. ([[Steve Wariner]], who had earlier been a member of Luman's band, later covered the song in 1984, and he, too, took it to No.&nbsp;4 on the country charts.)

Luman's other country hits included "[[Ain't Got Time to Be Unhappy]]," (1968) "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with [[Autry Inman]], 1968), "[[When You Say Love]]" (1972), "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973), "Proud Of You Baby" (1975), and "[[The Pay Phone]]" (1977).<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  Perhaps his most unusual song was a slow, soulful recitation of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[I Still Miss Someone]]."

Luman died of pneumonia in Nashville in late December 1978.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1533}}</ref>  He was 41 years old.  After his death, [[Bear Family Records]] released several compilations of his songs, including ''More of the Rocker'', ''Still Rockin''' and ''Carnival Rock''.<ref name=TSHA/>

==Legacy==
Luman is a member of both the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] and the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name=TSHA/>

His song "[[Lonely Women Make Good Lovers]]" was featured in the 1988 drama film ''[[Rain Man]]''.
