==Biography==
She was born in [[Boaz, Alabama]], and traveled west at the age of seven with her family, who had been [[sharecroppers]].  She later said in an interview:<ref name=rockabillyhall>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/MoreMB&R.html|title=More Maddox Brothers & Rose|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

<blockquote>Cotton prices failed in Alabama. So we left for California, the Land of Milk and Honey... We only had $35 when we left there, and a dream of going to California.  That was my mother's dream. Hitchhikin'. All of us. Five kids.... The brakemen helped us get on the right trains and they got us food from the caboose. Sometimes the brakemen locked us in the boxcars and told us to be quiet....  We got to Los Angeles, California, in 1933. The Salvation Army heard there was a family coming. They didn't have enough room there, so Dad and Cal slept in jail. At least it was a place to stay. We went from L.A. up to Oakland on the freights. We lived in Pipe City. There were these huge culvert pipes and all the migrants were living inside culverts. The mayor of Pipe City gave us his pipe to stay in. My mother got tired of asking for food every day. That's when we hit the front page of the ''Oakland Tribune'' as a family come west on the freights looking for work.</blockquote>

After her father eventually found work, the family ended up in [[Modesto, California]].<ref name=rockabillyhall/> Rose first performed with her brothers in amateur shows at the age of 11, and while in her teens began performing with them on local radio station [[KTRB]].<ref name=modesto/><ref name=rockabilly1/> The station offered her brothers a regular slot on condition that Rose sing with them, despite the opposition of their mother, who managed the group.<ref name=rockabillyhall/><ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rose-maddox-mn0000290414 Biography by John Bush], ''[[AllMusic]]''.

After the Maddox Brothers group broke up in 1957, Rose initially performed with her brother Cal and then started a solo career.<ref name=rockabilly1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/MaddoxRose.html|title=The Maddox Brothers & Rose|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=August 8, 2021|archive-date=July 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703184657/http://rockabillyhall.com/MaddoxRose.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=allmusic/> She had 14 hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country singles chart]] between 1959 and 1964, including several duets with [[Buck Owens]],<ref name="whitburn"/> and also recorded with [[Bill Monroe]].<ref name=modesto/> Her biggest hit, "Sing a Little Song of Heartache," reached no.3 on the country chart at the end of 1962.<ref name=allmusic/> She then began to specialize in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] recordings, recording the commercially successful and influential album ''Rose Maddox Sings Bluegrass'' for [[Capitol Records]].  After her contract with the company ended in 1965, she began to concentrate on tours, performing with her brothers Cal and Henry and son Donnie – who died in 1982 – in the UK, Europe and elsewhere.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name=oldies/> She also performed regularly with bluegrass musician [[Vern Williams]].<ref name=oldies/>

==Legacy==
[[Emmylou Harris]] believes Maddox has never received the recognition she deserves, in part because of what Harris calls a reluctance in American society to celebrate the value of white country and roots music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.honkytonks.org/showpages/maddox.htm|title=Honky Tonks, Hymns, & the Blues|website=Honkytonks.org|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref> [[Dolly Parton]] also credits Maddox as an early influence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bufwack and Oerrman|first=Mary and Robert|title=Finding Her Voice: Women In Country Music|pages=110, second ed}}</ref> [[Laura Cantrell]]'s song "California Rose" was written in memory of Maddox.<ref name="cantrell">{{Cite web|url=http://www.matadorrecords.com/laura_cantrell/biography.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115223101/http://www.matadorrecords.com/laura_cantrell/biography.html|url-status=dead|title=Laura Cantrell Biography|archive-date=November 15, 2007|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

Her life story and that of the band were told in the biography, ''Ramblin' Rose: The Life and Career of Rose Maddox'' by Jonny Whiteside.  The book won an award for excellence in 1998 from the [[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]] (ARSC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliffiestone.com/Cliffie/archives/photo03_23.html|title=Cliffie's Archives - LATER YEARS|website=Cliffiestone.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>
