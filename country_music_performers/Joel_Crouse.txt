I ended up getting in this horrible deal that I had to fight my way out of. And at this time, I’m broke, too. I’m on food stamps, trying to survive. I end up going to write a song with Todd Clark and he was like, ‘What’s going on in your life?’ I told him, ‘Dude, I feel like I’m just surviving.’ That started everything. I just started writing everything that was going on around me.'”<ref>{{cite news |url=https://americansongwriter.com/wasteland-album-joel-crouse-interview/ |title= Joel Crouse Discusses Finding His Voice Again, Writing For New EP 'wasteLAnd'|author= Katherine Yeske Taylor |work= American Songwriter|date= August 7, 2020 }}</ref>
