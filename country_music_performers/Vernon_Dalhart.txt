'''Marion Try Slaughter''' (April 6, 1883 – September 14, 1948), better known by his stage name '''Vernon Dalhart''', was an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. His recording of the classic ballad "[[Wreck of the Old 97]]" was the first country song reputed to have sold one million copies, although sales figures for pre-World War Two recordings are difficult to verify.

==Biography==
Dalhart was born in [[Jefferson, Texas]], on April 6, 1883. He took his stage name from two towns, [[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]] and [[Dalhart, Texas|Dalhart]] in Texas, between which he [[herding|punched cattle]] as a teenager in the 1890s. Dalhart's father, Robert Marion Slaughter, was killed by his brother-in-law, Bob Castleberry, when Vernon was age 10.<ref name=obit/> When Dalhart was 12 or 13, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas, Texas.

He sang and played harmonica and [[Jew's harp]] at local community events and attended the Dallas Conservatory of Music.<ref name="Manheim">{{cite web|last1=Manheim|first1=James|title=Vernon Dalhart|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vernon-dalhart-mn0000320572|website=AllMusic|access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref> He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children, a son and a daughter. In 1910, he moved the family to New York City, where he worked in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs.

===Music career===
Dalhart's education was rooted in [[classical music]]. He wanted to be an opera singer, and in 1913 he got parts in ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'' and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''.<ref name="Manheim" /> He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied. He was auditioned by [[Thomas Alva Edison]] and went on to record for [[Edison Records]]. From 1916 until 1923, he made over 400 recordings of light [[classical music]] and early dance band vocals for various record labels.

Between 1927 and 1929 he also recorded with the Vernon Dalhart Trio, composed of Vernon Dalhart, [[Adelyne Hood]], and [[Carson Robison]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/5710164-Vernon-Dalhart-Trio?noanv=1 | title=Vernon Dalhart Trio | website=[[Discogs]] }}</ref>

In the 1920s and 1930s, he sang on more than 5000 singles ([[Gramophone record|78s]]) for many labels, employing more than 100 pseudonyms, such as Al Craver, Vernon Dale, Frank Evans, Hugh Lattimer, Sid Turner, George White (with original Memphis Five) and Bob White.<ref name="Manheim" /> On [[Grey Gull Records]], he often used the name "Vel Veteran", which was also used by other singers, including [[Arthur Fields]]. He was already an established singer when he made his first [[country music]] recordings.

Dalhart stated in a 1918 interview amidst criticism of his accent seeming artificial, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way ...the 'sure 'nough Southerner' talks almost like a Negro, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit, more or less, in ordinary conversation, but it still comes pretty easy."<ref>''Country Music Originals - The Legends and the Lost''. Tony Russell. Oxford University Press. 2007. page 15. {{ISBN|978-0-19-532509-6}}</ref>

===Hits===
Dalhart had a hit single with his 1924 recording of "[[Wreck of the Old 97|The Wreck of the Old 97]]", a classic American [[ballad]] about the derailment of ''[[Fast Mail (Southern Railway)|Fast Mail]]'' train No. 97 near [[Danville, Virginia]], in 1903. Recorded for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], the song alerted the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-music vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. With "[[The Prisoner's Song]]" as the b-side, the single eventually sold as many as seven million copies, a huge number for recording in the 1920s. It was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the Recording Industry Association of America ([[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]])<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year=1978| title=The Book of Golden Discs| edition=2| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/14 14]| isbn=0-214-20512-6| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/14}}</ref> and was the biggest-selling, non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. [[Joel Whitburn]], a statistician for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, determined that "The Prisoner's Song" was No. 1 hit for twelve weeks in 1925–26.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |title=Pop Memories 1890-1954 |year=1986 |publisher=Record Research, Inc. |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89820-083-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit }}</ref>

One of the recordings most associated with Vernon Dalhart, especially in the United Kingdom, is his 1925 track "The Runaway Train" (Talking Machine Co., Camden, New Jersey, Victor 19685-A, Shellac).  This was played on BBC Radio's 'Children's Favourites' between 1954 and 1982, and even now almost every compilation of children's records in the UK includes this timeless favourite.

Wanting to repeat the success of the single, the Victor Company sent [[Ralph Peer]] to the southern mountains in 1927 to facilitate the [[Bristol Sessions]]. These sessions led to the discovery of singer [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the [[Carter Family]], after which Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the music industry.

=== Later life and death ===
By the late 1930s, Dalhart's popularity declined and he had lost much of his income in the [[Great Depression]]. Dalhart eventually retired and relocated to [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] in 1940 where he worked as a night clerk for the [[Hotel Beach | Hotel Barnum]]. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wshu.org/off-the-path-from-new-york-to-boston/2016-08-17/why-is-americas-first-country-music-superstar-buried-in-bridgeport | title=Why is America's First Country Music Superstar Buried in Bridgeport? | date=17 August 2016 }}</ref>

He died on September 14, 1948 of a [[coronary occlusion]] at the age of 65. He is buried in [[Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport | Mountain Grove Cemetery]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut | Bridgeport]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Vernon Dalhart, Song Writer, 65 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06E6D61230E23ABC4F52DFBF668383659EDE |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 17, 1948 |access-date=2015-09-11 }}</ref>
