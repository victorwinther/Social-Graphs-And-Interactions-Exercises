== History ==

The original concept of the Grascals occurred when the four core members, Terry Eldredge, Jamie Johnson, Jimmy Mattingly, and Dave Talbot, asked Terry Smith and Danny Roberts to join a new group they were wanting to start. They played one of their first shows at the Station Inn in February 2004 with special guest [[Osborne Brothers|Bobby Osborne]]. The Grascals began recording their first album in 2004, which would simply be a self-titled album on [[Rounder Records]]. This album featured such songs as "Me and John and Paul" written by [[Harley Allen]], "[[Where Corn Don't Grow]]" and another popular cover song, "Viva Las Vegas," which featured Dolly Parton.  During the recording, [[Dolly Parton]] showed interest in wanting to play with the Grascals.  The band soon became Dolly's opening act, as well as her bluegrass band.<ref name="bluegrasstoday.com"/> Performing at [[Dollywood]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]], the band and Dolly played a cover version of [[Elvis]]'s song, [[Viva Las Vegas (song)|"Viva Las Vegas."]] The [[The grascals (album)|first album]] made it on to the Billboard charts, as well as many country and bluegrass charts. Also on the album cover, Dolly is quoted saying, "One of the greatest albums I've ever heard."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-grascals|title=The Grascals Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>
