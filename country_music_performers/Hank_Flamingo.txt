==Biography==
Hank Flamingo was founded in 1989 in the state of [[Tennessee]]. Lead vocalist Trent Summar and his friend Eddie Grigg owned a [[farmhouse]] in [[Lascassas, Tennessee]], where they began working on music together. They began working with other musicians until they decided to form a band. The band's name originated when a friend of Summar's gave him a [[plastic flamingo]] as a gift, which he mounted inside the farmhouse next to a portrait of [[Hank Williams]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/496800550/ | title=Honest, downhome, and crazy | work=[[The Leader-Post]] | date=July 11, 1994 | accessdate=May 30, 2022 | pages=C3}}</ref>

By 1993, they were signed to a recording contract with [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records Nashville]], who released the band's eponymous debut album the following year. Hank Flamingo made an appearance on the talk show ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' to promote their album.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=

"Baby It's You" was the album's lead single.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-01-07.pdf | title=Flamingo Debut Takes Flight | journal=[[Radio & Records]] | pages=34 | date=January 7, 1994}}</ref>

Writing about the band in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Melinda Newman stated that " This new sextet comes on like a cross between [[Webb Wilder]] and [[the Georgia Satellites]]...Much of this release is way too quirky for country radio, but cuts such as 'Redneck Martians Stole My Baby' should make inroads at college and wacky alternative outlets."<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-07-31-Billboard-Page-0012.pdf | title=Upcoming Releases Rise To The Top; Garth Sparks Barbecues & Boycotts | author=Melinda Newman | magazine=Billboard | pages=12 | date=July 31, 1993}}</ref> A review in the same magazine was mixed, stating that it "caters to new country audience by combining country and alternative rock. Unfortunately, the record is devoid of any surprises."<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1994/BB-1994-02-19.pdf | title=Reviews | magazine=Billboard | pages=56 | date=February 19, 1994}}</ref> Susan Beyer of ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'' was more positive, praising the band's sense of humor and "controlled thrashing" of their playing, although she criticized the slower songs on the album.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/464855779/ | title=Country | work=The Ottawa Citizen | date=March 12, 1994 | accessdate=May 30, 2022 | pages=F3}}</ref> Mario Tarradell of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' similarly commended the band's humorous cuts such as "Redneck Martians Stole My Baby" and "Slaw", comparing the band favorably to [[Confederate Railroad]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/638287247/ | title=Hank Flamingo tracks hard-driving, offbeat | work=[[The Miami Herald]] | date=May 6, 1994 | accessdate=May 30, 2022 | pages=12G}}</ref>
