==Career==
===Acting===
====Television====
Panettiere first appeared in commercials at the age of eleven months, beginning with an advertisement for a [[Playskool]] toy train.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/?uuid=309fe6f9-d266-4913-a1b6-736b402188fe |title=Hayden Panettiere Profile|access-date=April 14, 2007 |publisher=E Online |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907185115/http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/?uuid=309fe6f9-d266-4913-a1b6-736b402188fe |archive-date=September 7, 2007}}</ref> She landed a role as [[Sarah Roberts (character)|Sarah Roberts]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'' from 1994 to 1997, which was followed by [[Lizzie Spaulding]] on the [[CBS]] soap opera ''[[Guiding Light]]'' in 1996, and again from 1997 to 2000. While on ''Guiding Light,'' Panettiere's character Lizzie battled [[leukemia]]. The [[Leukemia & Lymphoma Society]] gave her its Special Recognition Award for drawing the attention of daytime viewers to the disease, and for improving national awareness.

For her performance in [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]]'s 1999 TV movie ''[[If You Believe (film)|If You Believe]]'', she was nominated for the [[Young Artist Award]] for Young Actress Age Ten or Under in the category of Best Performance in a TV Movie or Pilot.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222029/awards ''If You Believe''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310105402/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222029/awards |date=March 10, 2016}}.

Panettiere gained greater fame as Claire Bennet in the NBC series ''[[Heroes (American TV series)|Heroes]],'' which was created by [[Tim Kring]], as a high school cheerleader with [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] healing powers. Thanks to her role on ''Heroes,'' she became a regular on the [[science fiction convention]] circuit, invited to attend conventions around the world in 2007, including [[Gen Con]], [[New York Comic Con]], and [[Fan Expo Canada]]. Panettiere has complained that her acting options are sometimes limited because "people look at [her] as either the popular cheerleader type or just the blonde".<ref>{{cite web |title=Heroes Season 2: Hayden Panettiere |publisher=CraveOnline|url=http://www.craveonline.com/filmtv/articles/04648709/heroes_season_2_hayden_panettiere.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622061327/http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04648709/heroes_season_2_hayden_panettiere.html |archive-date=June 22, 2008 |access-date=October 2, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In early 2007, Panettiere appeared on the [[MTV]] show, ''[[Punk'd]]''. The appearance was engineered by her mother and involved a male "fan" discussing her work with her, instigating a jealous reaction from the man's spouse. In April 2012, she hosted an episode of the new series.

In March 2012, it was announced Panettiere had been cast opposite [[Connie Britton]] on the ABC musical drama series ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'', where she portrayed [[Juliette Barnes]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nellie andreeva|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/02/hayden-panettiere-to-star-in-abc-drama-pilot-nashville/|title={{-'}}Heroes' Alumna Hayden Panettiere To Star In ABC Drama Pilot 'Nashville'|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 29, 2012|access-date=March 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908132808/http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/hayden-panettiere-to-star-in-abc-drama-pilot-nashville/|archive-date=September 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Megan Masters|url=http://www.tvline.com/2012/03/hayden-panettiere-nashville-aly-michalka-rebounding/|title=Pilot Scoop: Hayden Panettiere Joins Nashville, Hellcats Alumna Cast in Fox's Rebounding|website=[[TVLine]]|date=March 1, 2012|access-date=March 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133514/http://www.tvline.com/2012/03/hayden-panettiere-nashville-aly-michalka-rebounding/|archive-date=March 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Nellie Andreeva|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/05/abc-starts-new-series-pickups-with-penoza-red-man-van/|title=ABC Picks Up To Series '666', 'Last Resort', 'How To Live', 'Nashville', 'Penoza', 'Neighbors', 'Zero Hour', 'Red Van'|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=May 11, 2012|access-date=May 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713035228/http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/abc-starts-new-series-pickups-with-penoza-red-man-van/|archive-date=July 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The show reunited Panettiere with [[Burgess Jenkins]] (who appears in the first few episodes) from ''[[Remember the Titans]]''.
