It aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], but was canceled after one season. [[NBC]] subsequently picked up the show, but it was again canceled after one season. Later, he remarked that the network did not understand how to properly market his humor; thinking his routine was "too Southern" for a national network ("Has anyone heard me talk?", he commented in one of his stand-up routines), they based the first season of his sitcom in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. Later, the series aired on [[Nick at Nite]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]] in 2005 and 2006. He also appeared in [[Alan Jackson]]'s video for "[[I Don't Even Know Your Name]]" in 1995.

===Blue Collar Comedy===
[[File:Jeff Foxworthy at Resch Center.jpg|thumb|Foxworthy in performance at the Resch Center in Green Bay in 2015]]
In the early 2000s, Foxworthy had a career resurgence as a result of the [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]], in which he and three other comedians ([[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Ron White]], and [[Bill Engvall]]), specializing in common-man comedy, toured the country and performed for record crowds. The tour lasted three full years, constantly being extended after an initial run of 20 shows.

In 2004, he launched a new television series called ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' on [[The WB]]. He served as [[executive producer]] and starred alongside Blue Collar Comedy Tour-mates Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall. (Ron White made occasional guest appearances.) On Larry the Cable Guy's website, he posted that the show was canceled on October 17, 2005, by The WB. Reruns of ''Blue Collar TV'' continued until the network merged with [[UPN]] to form [[The CW]]. In 2006, Foxworthy resurrected the ''Blue Collar TV'' format on [[Country Music Television]] (CMT) with ''Foxworthy's Big Night Out''. The show began airing in the fall and was canceled after one season of 12 episodes.

===Books===
Foxworthy has authored several books, including ''You Might Be a Redneck If...'' (1989), as well as his autobiography, ''No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem!'' (1996). Artist [[Layron DeJarnette]] provided illustrations for the Redneck Dictionary books. R. David Boyd has been the exclusive illustrator for most of Foxworthy's books and album covers.

He also has released a [[cookbook]] entitled ''The Redneck Grill'', co-authored with [[Newnan, Georgia]], artist R. David Boyd, and "''Redneck Extreme Mobile Home Makeover''" (2005), a book with some of his redneck jokes.

In May 2008, Foxworthy released ''How to Really Stink at Golf'', with co-author [[Brian Hartt]] and illustrations by [[Layron DeJarnette]].
