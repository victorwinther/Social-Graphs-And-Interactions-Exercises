'''Robert Charles Goldsboro''' (born January 18, 1941)<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> is an American [[Popular music|pop]] and [[Country music|country]] singer and songwriter. He had a string of pop and country hits in the 1960s and 1970s, including his signature No. 1 hit "[[Honey (Bobby Goldsboro song)|Honey]]", which sold over 1 million copies in the United States, and the UK top-10 single "[[Summer (The First Time)]]".

Goldsboro starred in his own television show, ''[[The Bobby Goldsboro Show]]'', from 1973 to 1976. He also created several animated specials and children's books, as well as the [[PBS]] children's series ''[[The Swamp Critters of Lost Lagoon]]''.

==Early life==
Goldsboro was born in [[Marianna, Florida]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> During his first year of life, his family moved {{convert|35|mi}} north from Marianna to [[Dothan, Alabama]].<ref name="jwcntry"/> He learned to play the [[ukelele]] when he was around 12 years old before learning to play the guitar. He was interested in becoming a professional baseball player before turning his interest to music.<ref name=bickhart />

Goldsboro attended [[Dothan High School]]. In his senior year in high school he started playing in a band called The Webbs. After graduating from high school in 1959, he enrolled at [[Auburn University]], majoring in business administration.  Goldsboro left college after his second year to pursue a musical career, playing guitar in the backup band for [[Roy Orbison]].<ref name=bickhart>{{cite magazine|title=Watching Bobby Grows: A Decade of Hits |first=Jim |last=Bickhart |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA1961 |magazine=Billboard |date= October 5, 1974 |pages=BG-3, 4, 8}}</ref>

==Music career==
===The Webbs===
In high school Goldsboro joined Spider and The Webbs which featured Amos "Mugsby" on bass, Dave Robinson on drums, "Flying Fingers" John Rainey on lead guitar, and "Rockin{{'}}" Steve Murphree on rhythm guitar. He performed semi-professionally as part of The Webbs while at college. At the end of his second year in college, the manager of The Webbs [[Buddy Buie]] arranged for the band to play for Roy Orbison who was without a backing band in a show he organized. The arrangement worked well, and The Webbs then became the permanent backing band for Orbison for two-and-a-half years until 1964, touring with Orbison in the US and Europe.<ref name=bickhart /> 

When they were not touring with Orbison, The Webbs played in local gigs, recorded songs written by Goldsboro and had some local success. They came to the attention of an independent producer Jack Gold, who was interested in working with Goldsboro. He gave Goldsboro a song titled "[[Molly (Bobby Goldsboro song)|Molly]]" for him to record, and the song managed to chart on ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in early 1963.<ref name=bickhart /><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bobby-goldsboro/chart-history/hsi/ |title=Bobby Goldsboro chart history |magazine=Billboard }}</ref>

===Solo success===
Goldsboro continued performing with The Webbs and Orbison until his solo career kicked off with the top 10 hit "[[See the Funny Little Clown]]". The single, written by Goldsboro, reached No. 9 on the U.S. national charts in early 1964. It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book
