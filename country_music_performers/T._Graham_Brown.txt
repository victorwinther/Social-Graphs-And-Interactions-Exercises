==Musical career==
Brown moved to Nashville in 1982 and found work singing advertising [[jingle]]s for companies such as [[McDonald's]], [[Disneyland]], [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], Coors, Stroh's, Almond Joy, Coca-Cola, Sears, Dodge Trucks, Ford, Hardee's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, The Nashville Network, B.C.Powders, Dr Pepper, Mountain Dew, 7-Up, and Harrah's.<ref name="Larkin80"/> He was also the singing narrator in the [[Taco Bell]] "Run For the Border" television spots. Brown also found work as a songwriter for E.M.I. Publishing before signing to [[Capitol Records]] in 1984. He was with [[Universal Music Group Nashville]] for 13 years. His first release for the label, "Drowning in Memories", peaked at No.39 on the Billboard country chart. The title song of his debut album "I Tell It Like It Used To Be" went to No.7, followed by "I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again" to No.4, giving way to a pair of number ones: "Hell and High Water" and "Don't Go To Strangers".<ref name="whitburn"/>

Brown's first release for the label, "Drowning in Memories", peaked at No.&nbsp;39 and was never included on an album. Next came the No.&nbsp;7 "I Tell It Like It Used to Be", the first single from his 1986 album of the same name. Counting its title track, this album accounted for four singles: the No.&nbsp;3 "I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again" and two straight Number Ones in "Hell and High Water" and "Don't Go to Strangers".<ref name="Larkin80"/>

Brown's second album for the label, ''Brilliant Conversationalist'', followed a year later. Although none of its singles went to Number One, it accounted for three more Top Ten hits in its title track, followed by "She Couldn't Love Me Anymore" and "Last Resort".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1537|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic (((T. Graham Brown biography)))|access-date=2007-11-30|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> A third album, 1988's ''Come as You Were'', produced his third and final Number One in "Darlene".<ref name="Larkin80"/> Then came the No.&nbsp;7 title track and No.&nbsp;30 "Never Say Never". In early 1990, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single "Tomorrow's World", as well as [[Tanya Tucker]]'s single "Don't Go Out", from her album ''[[Tennessee Woman]]''.

1990 also saw the release of his next album, ''Bumper to Bumper''. This album's lead-off single "If You Could Only See Me Now" went Top Ten with a No.&nbsp;6 peak, but the other singles — the No.&nbsp;18 "Moonshadow Road" and No.&nbsp;53 "I'm Sending One Up for You" — did not fare as well, with the latter being his first single to land outside the Top 40. That same year, he also released an unsuccessful greatest-hits package. His next album, ''You Can't Take It with You'', only accounted for the No.&nbsp;31 "With This Ring" before he exited Capitol in 1991.

Brown did not record another album until 1998's ''Wine into Water'' on the Intersound label. This album produced four more singles for him, although the No.&nbsp;44 title track was the highest-charting single from it. The subject matter of the lyrics of the song surrounded Brown's then ongoing fight against alcoholism.<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=87}}</ref> He then released two more independent albums: ''The Next Right Thing'' in 2003 and ''The Present'' in 2006.

Brown joined Broadway icon [[Carol Channing]] for a duet of "[[Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree]]" on her 2012 album ''True To The Red, White, and Blue''. He also recorded a duet of "[[You Are So Beautiful]]" with [[Lulu Roman]] (of [[Hee Haw]] fame) for her 2013 album ''At Last''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Record Label|date=December 7, 2012|url=http://www.homesickent.com/projects.html|title=Homesick Entertainment Projects|publisher=Homesick Entertainment|access-date=December 7, 2012}}</ref> In 2012, Brown appeared on a Country/Gospel album<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/working-on-a-building-mw0002314051/credits|title=Working On A Building : Credits|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=November 2, 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, Brown again collaborated with producer [[Mark Carman]] to produce the [[Grammy]]-nominated album, ''Forever Changed'', featuring guest appearances by industry giants [[Leon Russell]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Jeff and Sheri Easter]], [[The Booth Brothers]], Three Bridges, [[Jimmy Fortune]], [[Sonya Isaacs]], and [[Jason Crabb]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards|title=Awards Nominations & Winners|date=April 30, 2017|website=Grammy.com|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref> In July 2014 the first single from the album was released on the MCM World Media Label. The song, "He'll Take Care of You", was written by well known, award-winning songwriters [[Dan Penn]], [[Gary Nicholson (singer)|Gary Nicholson]], and [[Donnie Fritts]].
