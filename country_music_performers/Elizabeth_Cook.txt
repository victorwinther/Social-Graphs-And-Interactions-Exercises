==Early life==
The youngest of 12 children, Cook was born in [[Wildwood, Florida]]. Her mother, Joyce, played [[mandolin]] and guitar and performed on radio and local television. Her father, Thomas, also played string instruments. He honed his skills playing upright bass in the [[Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]] prison band while serving time for running [[moonshine]]. In prison he learned welding; Cook would name her 2010 album ''[[Welder (album)|Welder]]''.<ref name="NPR01">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126910286 "Elizabeth Cook: Daughter Of A 'Welder'"] interview/report by [[All Things Considered]] host [[Melissa Block]], May 18, 2010. Retrieved May 18, 2010.</ref> After his release from prison, he and Joyce began playing together in local country bands. Elizabeth was onstage with them when she was 4, singing material like songwriter John Schweers' "[[Daydreams About Night Things]]", a 1975 hit for [[Ronnie Milsap]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00sy7f0 |title=BBC Radio 2 - Bob Harris Country, Elizabeth Cook in session |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=July 8, 2010 |access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref> She formed a band when she was 9.

Cook graduated from [[Georgia Southern University]] in 1996 with dual degrees in Accounting and Computer Information Systems.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elizabeth-cook.com/bio.html | title=Elizabeth Cook Bio | work=Elizabeth-Cook.com | access-date=August 23, 2021 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226060537/http://elizabeth-cook.com/bio.html | archive-date=February 26, 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
Cook moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1996 to work for [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. She got a publishing deal and ended up sleeping on the floor of the publishing house for three years while she worked on honing her craft, with ''The Blue Album'', which contained demo recordings she had made in Nashville, finally being released in 2000. She cut her major-label debut, 2002's ''[[Hey Y'all]]'', for [[Atlantic Records]].  ''Hey Y'all'' wasn't a success. After taking a shot at co-writing,  Cook  asked to be released from her contract. A proposed deal with [[Sony Records]] subsequently fell through.

She released 2004's ''[[This Side of the Moon]]'', which was eventually picked up by record label [[Thirty Tigers]]. It received positive reviews from ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503EFDC1430F931A15751C1A9639C8B63&scp=1&sq=%22This%20Side%20Of%20The%20Moon%22%20cook&st=cse | title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: Stealth Sounds That Missed the Charts but Merit a Hearing | first=Kelefa | last=Sanneh | author-link=Kelefa Sanneh | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 22, 2005 | access-date=May 18, 2010}} E. Cook's album is one of ten noted in the article.</ref> and ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]''. Produced by [[Rodney Crowell]], ''[[Balls (Elizabeth Cook album)|Balls]]'', which included a song Cook had written with songwriter [[Melinda Schneider]], "Sometimes It Takes Balls to Be a Woman", was released in May 2007. ''Welder'' featured appearances by [[Dwight Yoakam]], Crowell and [[Buddy Miller]].

Cook toured in America, as well as in South Korea, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Poland, France and the UK. She appeared at the [[Cambridge Folk Festival]], the Maverick Festival and the Borderline in London. She has continued to play the [[Grand Ole Opry]], making over 400 appearances—the most by a non-member of the radio show.

She toured the UK in support of ''Welder'', performing 18 dates with her then-husband, guitarist and songwriter Tim Carroll, and her upright bass player [[Bones Hillman]], formerly of [[Midnight Oil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobharris.org/pages/playlist.asp?progcode=c08072010 |title=Bob Harris playlist for Bob Harris Country - 8 July 2010 |website=Bobharris.org |access-date=September 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925003612/http://www.bobharris.org/pages/playlist.asp?progcode=c08072010 |archive-date=September 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Cook was invited by the [[Atlanta Braves]] to sing the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] before their 2011 home opener on April 8, 2011.<ref name="DOBBlog">"[http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-braves-blog/2011/03/31/braves-opening-day-the-fredi-g-era-begins/ Braves Opening Day: The Fredi G.

At the suggestion of [[Paul Shaffer]], Cook was invited in August 2011 to be a guest on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', where she discussed satellite radio and growing up in Florida. She considered starring in a [[CBS]] sitcom about a single mother whose life is disrupted by the arrival of her criminal father, but the show never came to fruition. In June 2012 Cook returned to the ''Late Show'' to perform with [[Jason Isbell]]. ''[[American Songwriter]]'' notes that they sang covers of [[Townes Van Zandt]]'s "[[Pancho and Lefty]]" and "Tecumseh Valley".<ref>{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Cook and Jason Isbell Cover Townes Van Zandt|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/elizabeth-cook-and-jason-isbell-cover-townes-van-zandt/|work=[[American Songwriter]]|date=June 15, 2012|access-date=June 18, 2012}}</ref> On March 14, 2013, she appeared a third time on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and was interviewed by Letterman. She worked extensively with [[Carlene Carter]] on Carter's tenth studio album, ''[[Carter Girl]]''.  On June 2, 2014, she appeared a fourth time on ''Late Show with David Letterman'', performing [[Lou Reed]]'s "[[Pale Blue Eyes]]".

In 2016, Cook released her sixth studio album, ''Exodus of Venus''.

Starting in 2020, Cook began hosting ''Upstream with Elizabeth Cook'', a fishing show on the [[Circle (TV network)|Circle network]].

On September 11, 2020, she released the album ''Aftermath''.

She can also be heard on select episodes of the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Squidbillies]]'', where she voices Tammi.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Radio show==
Cook hosts the mid-day radio show "Elizabeth Cook's Apron Strings" on the [[Sirius XM radio]] station [[Outlaw Country (Sirius XM)|Outlaw Country]]. She has been nominated for two Ameripolitan Music Awards for her radio work.

==Personal life==
After ''Welder'' was released, she and Carroll divorced,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-bialas/show-and-tell-it-like-it_b_5808116.html|title=Show and Tell It Like It Is: Elizabeth Cook Pulls Some Apron Strings in Nashville|first=Michael|last=Bialas|website=[[HuffPost]] |date=September 12, 2014}}</ref> and she lost her family farm. In addition, her father, mother, brother, mother-in-law and brother-in-law died during this period.  She cancelled an upcoming tour and entered rehab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/06/23/elizabeth-cook-triumphs-over-tragedy/85863360/|title=Elizabeth Cook triumphs over tragedy|website=[[The Tennessean]] }}</ref>

Cook later said, "I needed some help. I did not feel like rehab was what I needed and I tried to desperately convince some key people around me that in that moment I needed intensive therapy and I probably needed medication. They cancelled the tour and said you can't go because we don't trust the state that you're in. You're saying you're not addicted to anything and you're saying you don't have an eating disorder but we don't know that". She was critical of the treatment she received during rehab.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}
