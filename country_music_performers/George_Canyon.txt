==Biography==
George Canyon has held many jobs: he spent time working as a bylaw enforcement officer/special constable, a [[slaughterhouse]] beef inspector, and the owner/operator of his own recording studio. He always dreamed of becoming a professional musician.<ref>url={{cite web |url=http://www.georgecanyon.com/about |title=About &#124; Official Website of George Canyon:Multiple Juno and CCMA Award Winning Canadian Country Artist |access-date=August 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828081334/http://www.georgecanyon.com/about |archive-date=August 28, 2010 }}</ref>
    
Canyon is the father of two children. His wife worked three jobs during the day so that he could sing at night. In 2004, George Canyon competed in ''[[Nashville Star]] 2''. He was the runner-up in the competition, but became very well known in Canada and garnered much support, being the only Canadian to make the cut for the competition. After the competition ended, he received many accolades from fans and the industry alike. These include the top 5 hit "My Name", a [[Juno Award]] for Best Country Recording of the Year (for his album ''[[One Good Friend]]''), and, four [[Canadian Country Music Awards]] Nominations (CCMAs) including Male Vocalist of the Year and the Fan Choice Award.
