'''John Bush Shinn III''' (February 17, 1935{{spnd}}October 16, 2020) was an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and musician. Nicknamed the "Country [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]]", Bush was best known for his distinctive voice and for writing the song "Whiskey River", a top 10 hit for himself which also became the signature song of fellow country artist [[Willie Nelson]]. He was especially popular in his native [[Texas]].<ref name="Shelburne">{{cite web | last = Shelburne | first = Craig | title = Thanks to Botox, Johnny Bush Sings Again: Texas Artist Had a Hit With "Whiskey River," Then Lost His Voice | work = CMT News | url = http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1558595/thanks-to-botox-johnny-bush-sings-again.jhtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606150129/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1558595/thanks-to-botox-johnny-bush-sings-again.jhtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = June 6, 2011 | access-date = February 20, 2008}}</ref>

==Early life==
Bush was born John Bush Shinn III in the [[Kashmere Gardens]] neighborhood of [[Houston]].<ref name="KTRK">{{cite news|title=Texas Country Music Hall of Fame member Johnny Bush dead at 85|url=https://abc13.com/johnny-bush-dies-singer-whiskey-river-songwriter/7104543/|date=October 17, 2020|access-date=October 17, 2020|publisher=KTRK-TV}}</ref> He listened to the [[western swing]] music of [[Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys]] and the [[Honky-tonk#Honky tonk music|honky-tonk]] sounds of artists such as [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], and [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]].<ref name="johnnybush.com">{{cite web | title = Johnny Bush: Biography | url = http://www.johnnybush.com/bio.html | access-date = February 20, 2008 }}</ref> His uncle, the host of a local radio program on [[KBME (AM)|KTHT]], urged Bush and his brother to play on air, giving Bush his first experience of performing in public.<ref name=KTRK/> Bush subsequently moved to [[San Antonio]] in 1952, beginning a solo career in area honky-tonks such as the Texas Star Inn, before switching to drums.  During this period, he earned his stage name, when an announcer mistakenly introduced him as "Johnny Bush". As a drummer, he worked for bands such as the  Mission City Playboys, the Texas Plainsmen, and the Texas Top Hands.<ref name="johnnybush.com"/>

==Career==
===Early years===
Bush joined [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band, the Cherokee Cowboys, in 1963 along with a young [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Darrell McCall]]. His association with Price led Bush to Nashville and a contract to sing for record demonstrations. He also played in Nelson's band, the Record Men. With Nelson's financial backing Bush recorded his first album in 1967, ''The Sound of a Heartache''.<ref name="Shelburne"/><ref name="johnnybush.com"/><ref name="AllMusicGuide">{{cite book | last = Bogdanov | first = Vladimir |author2=Chris Woodstra |author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine  | title = All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music | publisher = Backbeat Books | year = 2003 | location = San Francisco | pages = 104–105 | isbn = 0-87930-760-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Malone | first = Bill | author-link = Bill C.

===Stardom and vocal problems===
A series of regional hits on the Stop label, including "[[You Gave Me a Mountain]]" (penned by [[Marty Robbins]]), "Undo the Right" (penned by Willie Nelson and [[Hank Cochran]]), "What A Way To Live", and "I'll Be There" soon followed.  Rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] said that Bush's version of "You Gave Me A Mountain" "brings a catch to the throat and a tear to the eye." These songs did well in Bush's native Texas, and reached the national top 20. In 1972, he was signed to [[RCA Records]] whose Nashville division was headed by legendary guitarist [[Chet Atkins]]. His first RCA single, "Whiskey River" was climbing the charts with airplay on countless radio stations when his voice began faltering. Bush even felt he was being punished by God for his sins. Bush has since said: "I thought because of my promiscuous behavior and bad choices and being raised as a Baptist, that it was a punishment from God."<ref name="Shelburne"/><ref name="johnnybush.com"/><ref name="AllMusicGuide"/><ref name="Wolff">{{cite book | last = Wolff | first = Kurt |author2=Orla Duane | title = Country Music: The Rough Guide | publisher = Rough Guides | year = 2000 | location = London | pages = 346–347 | isbn = 1-85828-534-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Christgau | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Christgau | title = Rock Albums of the '70s: A Critical Guide | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1990 | location = New York | pages = 68 | isbn = 0-306-80409-3}}</ref>

Bush lost half of his vocal range and was sometimes unable to talk. RCA dropped him in 1974 after three albums, he developed a drug habit and was often stricken with performance anxiety when he was able to perform at all. After several misdiagnoses, doctors diagnosed the cause in 1978 when they discovered he had a rare neurological disorder called [[spasmodic dysphonia]].  Although this did not prevent him from recording, Bush's career began to take a downturn. He worked with a vocal coach in 1985, and was able to regain 70% of his original voice.<ref name="Shelburne"/><ref name="johnnybush.com"/><ref name="AllMusicGuide"/><ref name="Wolff"/>

===Later years===
Bush teamed with Darrell McCall in 1986, recording a successful honky-tonk album ''Hot Texas Country'' and began assembling a large country band (as did Willie Nelson) performing around [[South Texas]]. In 1994, the band released ''Time Changes Everything'', the same year that RCA released a greatest-hits album. A major tour soon followed. In recent years, Bush has continued to tour regularly, often performing with Nelson<!-- not recently     and the late [[Merle Haggard]] -->.<ref name="Shelburne"/><ref name="johnnybush.com"/><ref name="AllMusicGuide"/><ref name="Wolff"/>

Several albums on local Texas labels soon followed. His renewed visibility made him a mentor figure to younger Texas musicians who revered the honky-tonk/hardcore country sound that Bush has done so much to keep in the public eye. Austin musicians such as [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]] and [[Cornell Hurd]] sought him out to play on their albums. In 2003, he was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame with his lifelong friend Willie Nelson on hand to induct him. In 2007, he released his autobiography, with the aid of Rick Mitchell: ''Whiskey River (Take My Mind): The True Story of Texas Honky-Tonk'', published by [[University of Texas Press]]. A new album, ''Kashmere Garden Mud: A Tribute to Houston’s Country Soul'', was released on the Icehouse label at the same time.<ref name="Shelburne"/><ref name="johnnybush.com"/><ref name="AllMusicGuide"/><ref name="Wolff"/>

With the success of his recent [[Botox]] treatments for his vocal condition and his successful career revival, Bush was a spokesman for people afflicted with vocal disorders. In 2002, he was honored with the Annie Glenn Award from the National Council of Communicative Disorders for Bush's work in bringing attention to the condition of spasmodic dysphonia.<ref name="Shelburne"/><ref name="johnnybush.com"/><ref name="AllMusicGuide"/><ref name="Wolff"/> Bush self-released ''The Absolute Johnny Bush,'' a full-length album of new recordings, in June 2017. It included collaborations with Dale Watson and [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Bush finds enduring interest in traditional country|url=https://wacotrib.com/entertainment/accesswaco/johnny-bush-finds-enduring-interest-in-traditional-country/article_07e80ac9-ae83-5736-8405-cefa9c682902.html|first=Carl|last=Hoover|date=November 14, 2018|access-date=October 17, 2020|newspaper=Waco Tribune-Herald}}</ref>
