'''James Frederick Rodgers''' (September 18, 1933 – January 18, 2021) was an American pop singer. Rodgers had a run of hits and mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. His string of crossover singles ranked highly on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]], [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]], and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm and Blues Sides]] charts; in the 1960s, Rodgers had more modest successes with [[adult contemporary music]].

He was not related to country music pioneer [[Jimmie Rodgers|Jimmie C. Rodgers]] (1897–1933), who died the same year the younger Rodgers was born. Among country audiences, and in his official songwriting credits, the younger Rodgers, Jimmie Frederick, was often credited as '''Jimmie F. Rodgers''' to differentiate the two.

==Career==
===Early years===
Rodgers was born in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref name="auto4">Wayne Harada. "Spotlighted Singer." ''Honolulu Advertiser'', September 15, 1957, p. 36.</ref>  He was the second son of Archie and Mary Rodgers.<ref name="auto2">John Vergara, "Oh, Oh, He's Done It Again." ''New York Daily News'', April 27, 1958, p. M4.</ref>  Rodgers was taught music by his mother, a piano teacher,<ref name="auto1">"Jimmie Rodgers Returns to the Stage." ''Reno (NV) Gazette'', February 24, 1983, p. 16.</ref> and began performing as a child, first entertaining at a Christmas show when he was only five.<ref name="auto4" /> He learned to play the piano and guitar, and performed locally.

After attending [[Camas High School]], he briefly took courses at Clark College in Vancouver, Washington.<ref name="auto2" /> He later went to work at the [[Crown Zellerbach]] paper mill in Camas.  Although he loved music, he was uncertain whether he could turn it into a career. He was subsequently drafted and served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.<ref name="auto">Dick Kleiner. "Honeycomb Started Here." ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 3, 1957, p. 7C.</ref>

=== 1950s ===
While in the Air Force, Rodgers joined a band named The Melodies started by violinist Phil Clark. During his service, he was transferred to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was stationed at Sewart Air Force Base from 1954 to 1956.<ref name="auto3">Robert K. Oermann. "Jimmie Rodgers: There's No Stopping Him Now." ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 27, 1985, p. D1.</ref> It was during this time that he began expanding his musical repertoire. While he was in Nashville, he first heard "[[Honeycomb (song)|Honeycomb]]", the song that became his first hit.<ref name="auto" />

Like a number of other entertainers of the era, he was one of the contestants on [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s talent show on CBS television, winning $700.<ref name="auto5">{{Cite web |title=Jimmie Rodgers on singing and surviving |url=https://www.thespectrum.com/story/entertainment/2016/05/26/jimmie-rodgers-singing-and-surviving/84813944/ |website=The Spectrum & Daily News}}</ref>  When [[Hugo Peretti]] and [[Luigi Creatore]] left [[RCA Records#Beginnings and history|RCA Victor]] for [[Morris Levy]]'s company, [[Roulette Records]], they became aware of Rodgers' talent and signed him to a recording contract.

In the summer of 1957, he recorded his version of "[[Honeycomb (song)|Honeycomb]]", written by [[Bob Merrill]] and recorded by [[Georgie Shaw]] three years earlier.<ref>Rod Ellis. "WDXN's Disc Digest." ''(Clarksville TN) Leaf-Chronicle'', September 6, 1957, p. 3.</ref>  The tune was Rodgers' biggest [[Hit song|hit]], staying on the top of the charts for four weeks. It sold over 1 million copies,<ref>"Honeycomb Passes Million." ''Cashbox'', October 5, 1957, p. 32.</ref> and was awarded a [[Music recording certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{Cite book |last=Murrells |first=Joseph |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |year=1978 |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |edition=2nd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 95] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Over the following year, he had a number of other hits that reached the top 10 on the charts: "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]"; "[[Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again]]"; "[[Secretly]]"; and "[[Are You Really Mine?]]". Other hits include "[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]]", "Bimbombey", "Ring-a-ling-a-lario", "Tucumcari", "Tender Love and Care (T.L.C)", and a version of ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' as a film [[tie-in]] with the apocalyptic movie ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' in 1959.

In the United Kingdom, "Honeycomb" reached number 30 pn the UK Singles Chart in November 1957, and "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]" climbed to number 7 the following month.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{Cite book |last=Roberts |first=David |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |year=2006 |isbn=1-904994-10-5 |edition=19th |location=London |page=467}}</ref> Both "Kisses Sweeter than Wine" and "Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again" were million sellers.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" />

The success of "Honeycomb" earned Rodgers guest appearances on numerous variety programs during 1957, including the "Shower of Stars" program, hosted by [[Jack Benny]], on October 31, 1957,<ref>Barbara Sammons. "Your TV Favorites on New Time Schedule Starting Today." ''Greenville (SC) News'', October 27, 1957, p. 28.</ref> and the Big Record with [[Patti Page]], on December 4, 1957.<ref>"Wednesday Television Programs." ''(New Brunswick NJ) Sunday Home News'', December 1, 1957, p. 13.</ref>  Rodgers also made several appearances on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'', including on September 8, 1957, when he was seen by 48,500,000, the largest television audience of his entire career,<ref>"TV News." ''(Salem OR) Capital Journal'', September 7, 1957, Section 2, p. 6.</ref> and November 3, 1957.<ref>"Famous Dancers From Bali Will Be on KOIN-TV." ''(Longview WA) Daily News'', November 2, 1957, p. 19.</ref>  In 1958, he appeared on NBC's ''[[The Gisele MacKenzie Show]]''. Also in 1958, he sang the opening theme song of the film ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]], [[Joanne Woodward]] and [[Orson Welles]].<ref>"Folk Song Rodgers to Do Title Number." ''Los Angeles Times'', December 27, 1957, part 3, p. 10.</ref> He then had his own short-lived televised variety show on NBC in 1959.<ref>William Ewald. "Television in Review." ''Naugatuck (CT) News'', May 27, 1959, p. 7.</ref>

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, Rodgers' [[Sloop John B|"Wreck of the John B"]] was a number 1 hit in Canada, and reached No. 64 on the U.S.charts. His biggest hit of the decade in the UK was "English Country Garden", a version of the folk song "[[Country Gardens]]", which reached number 5 in the chart in June 1962.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />  In 1962, he moved to the [[Dot Records|Dot]] label, and four years later to [[A&M Records]]. He also appeared in some films, including ''[[The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1961 film)|The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[Back Door to Hell]]'', which he helped finance.

In 1966, a long dry spell ended for Rodgers when he re-entered the Top 40 with "[[It's Over (Jimmie Rodgers song)|It's Over]]" (later to be recorded by [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Mason Williams]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], and [[Sonny James]]). In 1967, he changed record labels, signing with [[A&M Records]].<ref>Bill Rumfelt. "Easy Listening." ''Rocky Mount (NC) Telegram'', September 17, 1967, p. 2A.</ref> It was with that label that Rodgers had his final charting Top 100 single, "Child of Clay", written by [[Ernie Maresca]] (of "[[Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)]]" fame).<ref>David F. Wagner. "Under the Album Covers." ''Appleton (WI) Post-Crescent'', September 24, 1967, p. S10.</ref> He performed the song on several television variety shows, including ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'',<ref>"Channel Choices," ''Allentown (PA) Morning Call'', November 11, 1967, p. 10</ref> but it never became a big hit; it reached number 31 on the ''Billboard'' charts.

===Later career===
Recovery from injuries sustained mysteriously on a highway in 1967 caused an approximately year-long period in which Rodgers ceased to perform. Meanwhile, his voice was still being heard: Several of his earlier hits were used in jingles in the 1970s, one for [[SpaghettiOs]] and another for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb]] breakfast cereal.<ref name="auto3" /> And Rodgers' songs continued to make the ''Billboard'' Country and Easy Listening charts until 1979. During the summer of 1969, he made a brief return to network television with a summer variety show <ref>Paul Henniger. "TV People." ''San Francisco Examiner'', December 2, 1970, p. TV 19</ref> on ABC (which later bought the rights to Rodgers' [[Dot Records]] releases, now owned by [[Universal Music Group]]). It was not until the early 1980s when he began doing some limited live appearances again. Among the earliest was a series of shows in late February 1983: he performed at [[Harrah's Reno]] Casino Cabaret.<ref name="auto1" /> He also performed a few shows in other cities, including at a nightclub named Mister Days in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in late 1983.<ref>Tim Smith. "Jimmie Rodgers Rides Sweet Nostalgia Wave." ''Fort Lauderdale News/Sun-Sentinel'', May 27, 1983, p. 22.</ref>

Rodgers appeared in the 1999 video ''Rock & Roll Graffiti'' by American Public Television, along with about 20 other performers.<ref name="auto6">{{Cite news |title=Street signs point to Jimmie Rodgers Avenue |work=The Columbian |url=https://www.columbian.com/news/2013/sep/13/street-signs-point-to-jimmie-rodgers-avenue/}}</ref> Nevertheless, he gave "Honeycomb" a try, and he mentioned that he had a show in Branson, Missouri.

Rodgers returned to his hometown of Camas, Washington in 2011 and 2012, performing to sell-out crowds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 2013, his neighbors successfully got a street named after him, in the neighborhood where he grew up.<ref name="auto6" />

==Head injuries==
On December 1, 1967, Rodgers suffered traumatic head injuries after the car he was driving was stopped by an off-duty police officer near the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles. He had a fractured skull and required several surgeries.<ref name="sreimp">{{Cite news |date=December 11, 1967 |title=Singer reported improved after two brain operations |page=3A |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=Associated Press |location=(Oregon) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8OVVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4741%2C2607319}}</ref> Initial reports in the newspapers attributed his injuries to a severe beating with a blunt instrument by unknown assailants.<ref name="sgrhosp">{{Cite news |date=December 4, 1967 |title=Singer hospitalized |page=8 |work=Spartanburg Herald |agency=Associated Press |location=(South Carolina) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aX0sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vMwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6810%2C713954}}</ref><!--<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bWIwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3886,1691466&hl=en] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> --> Rodgers had no specific memory of how he had been injured, remembering only that he had seen blindingly bright lights from a car pulling up behind him.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BAAqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7361,530374&dq=jimmie+rodgers+bright+lights&hl=en |website=News.google.com |access-date=2016-09-20 |archive-date=2020-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309185307/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BAAqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7361,530374&dq=jimmie+rodgers+bright+lights&hl=en |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A few days later, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) stated that off-duty LAPD officer Michael Duffy (at times identified in the press as Richard Duffy) had stopped him for erratic driving, and that Rodgers had stumbled, fallen and hit his head. According to the police version, Duffy then called for assistance from two other officers, and the three of them put the unconscious Rodgers into his car and left the scene.<ref name="ppapltf">{{Cite news |date=December 20, 1967 |title=Jimmie Rodgers' injury linked to fall |page=11 |work=Pittsburgh Press |agency=UPI |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CsQbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pU8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7177%2C1546271}}</ref> That account was supported by the treating physicians, who had first blamed the skull fracture on a beating but, by the latter part of December, they concluded that Rodgers had in fact fallen and that had caused his injuries.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dmIwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=918,4276394&hl=en "New Disclosure Hints Rodgers Hurt By Fall," ''The Modesto Bee'', December 20, 1967, p.

== Lawsuits ==
The following month, Rodgers filed an $11 million lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles, claiming that the three officers had beaten him.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bronson |first=Fred |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits: Updated and Expanded 5th Edition |publisher=Billboard Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-823-07677-2 |location=New York |page=27}}</ref> The police and the L.A.

The three officers and the LA Fire and Police Protective League filed a $13 million slander suit against Rodgers for his public statements accusing them of brutality.<ref name="njrbsu">{{Cite news |last=Villasenor |first=Rudy |date=April 11, 1968 |title=Now Jimmie Rodgers being sued - for $13 million |page=5 |work=Tuscaloosa News |agency=(Los Angeles Times) |location=(Alabama) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=agAdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OZsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7089%2C2021890}}</ref>

Neither suit came to trial; the police slander suit was dropped, and in 1973 Rodgers elected to accept a $200,000 settlement from the Los Angeles City Council, which voted to give him the money rather than to incur the costs and risks of further court action.<ref name="fssetsu">{{Cite news |date=August 23, 1973 |title=Folk singer settles suit for $200,000 |page=15-A |work=St. Petersburg Times |agency=UPI |location=(Florida) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gepRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-HIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7055%2C1376958}}</ref> Rodgers and his supporters still believe that one or more of the police officers beat him, although other observers find the evidence inconclusive.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nashville Sound: Jimmie Rodgers |url=https://apnews.com/4c81ad015fac57cb988e8525ce047ad7 |website=Apnews.com}}</ref> In his 2010 biography ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', singer [[Tommy James]] wrote that [[Morris Levy]], the Mafia-connected head of Roulette Records, had arranged the attack in response to Rodgers' repeated demands for unpaid royalties he was due by the label. All of Rodgers' most successful singles had been released by Roulette, who were notorious for not paying their artists for their record sales.<ref>James, Tommy, ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', Scribner Publishing, 2010, p. 205</ref>

In 1993, Raymond Virgil Whisman, one of the three officers who were alleged to have assaulted Rodgers, was arrested for assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her.  The arrest occurred after sheriff's deputies stormed his house after being informed that he was holding his wife at gunpoint. Deputies found 11 rifles, four shotguns, and two handguns in the home.  Whisman was charged with two counts of assault and two counts of making terroristic threats.<ref>The Signal,Santa Clarita, California

== Publication ==
In 2010, Rodgers wrote and published his autobiography, ''Dancing on the Moon: The Jimmie Rodgers Story.''<ref name="auto5" /> 

== Personal life ==
Rodgers and his first wife Colleen (''née'' McClatchey) divorced in 1970, and she died May 20, 1977.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lodi News-Sentinel - Google News Archive Search |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19770520&id=QMMzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wjIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=4723,2163053 |website=News.google.com}}</ref>  They had two children, Michael and Michele. He had remarried in 1970, and Jimmie and Trudy Rodgers had two sons, Casey and Logan. He and Trudy divorced in the late 1970s, and he remarried again. Jimmie and Mary Rodgers were still married when he died, and they have a daughter, Katrine, who was born in 1989.

Rodgers suffered from [[spasmodic dysphonia]] for a number of years and could hardly sing. After a 2012 concert, he returned home for open heart surgery, following a heart attack he had suffered three weeks earlier. 

Rodgers died from kidney disease on January 18, 2021 at the age of 87.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Best Classic Bands Staff |date=19 January 2021 |title=Jimmie Rodgers, Early Rock 'n' Roll Star, Dies at 87 |work=Best Classic Bands |url=https://bestclassicbands.com/jimmie-rodgers-obituary-pop-singer-honeycomb-1-19-21 |access-date=2021-01-20}}</ref>
