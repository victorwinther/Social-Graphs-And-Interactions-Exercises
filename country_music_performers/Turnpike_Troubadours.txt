The '''Turnpike Troubadours''' are an American [[country music]] band from [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]] founded in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Liptak |first=Carena |date=2021-12-10 |title=Who Are the Turnpike Troubadours? A Timeline of the Band’s Rise, Hiatus and Return |url=https://countrynow.com/who-are-the-turnpike-troubadours-a-timeline-of-the-bands-rise-hiatus-and-return/ |access-date=2024-02-12 |website=Country Now |language=en-US}}</ref> They started their own imprint, Bossier City Records, in 2007 and have released six studio albums. Their self-titled 2015 album peaked at number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

==Career==
The band was formed in 2005 by [[Evan Felker]] and R.C. Edwards. Their debut album, ''Bossier City,'' was recorded a month after the formation of the band, in order to have a recording to sell at live shows. Felker later said the musical arrangements were "not a good representation" of what the band later became.<ref name="wofford">{{cite news |last1=Wofford |first1=Jerry |title=Evan Felker of Turnpike Troubadours talks on the band's success ahead of its Cain's show |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/scene/offbeat/evan-felker-of-turnpike-troubadours-talks-on-the-band-s/article_7e39eb72-2257-5186-8c9e-1fa7fc3dbe3b.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220095042/https://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/scene/offbeat/evan-felker-of-turnpike-troubadours-talks-on-the-band-s/article_7e39eb72-2257-5186-8c9e-1fa7fc3dbe3b.html |archive-date=20 February 2020 |accessdate=3 May 2018 |work=Tulsa World |language=en}}</ref> 

Their sophomore album, ''Diamonds & Gasoline,'' followed in 2010.<ref name="Diamonds & Gasoline">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/diamonds-and-gasoline-mw0002023125 | title=''Diamonds & Gasoline'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 10, 2022 | archive-date=April 9, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409224351/https://www.allmusic.com/album/diamonds-and-gasoline-mw0002023125 | url-status=live }}</ref>  

The songs "Easton and Main" and "Bossier City" were re-recorded for their 2015 self-titled album.<ref name="wofford" /> 

In October 2017, the album ''[[A Long Way from Your Heart]]'' was released, peaking at number three on the [[Top Country Albums|''Billboard'' Top Country Albums]] chart.

Following a string of poor performances in late 2018, stemming from Felker's insobriety, the band was forced to cancel 12 shows slated to be held in the weeks to follow, returning on November 30th to play at [[Moody Theater|ACL Live]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Freeman |first=Jon |date=2018-10-30 |title=Turnpike Troubadours Cancel Concerts for 'Situation That Needs Our Complete Attention' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/turnpike-troubadours-tour-cancelled-749742/ |access-date=2024-02-13 |website=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Trigger |date=2018-12-01 |title=Turnpike Troubadours Make Return to the Stage in Austin - Saving Country Music |url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/turnpike-troubadours-make-return-to-the-stage-in-austin/ |access-date=2024-02-13 |website=www.savingcountrymusic.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Felker's personal battles continued the following year, spurring the band to cancel all remaining tour dates.
