The band consisted of [[Brady Seals]] (lead vocals), Keith Horne (bass guitar), Trey Landry (drums), and [[Mark Matejka]] (guitar). Matjeka was replaced in 2006 by Kevin Ray. Seals was initially co-lead vocalist and keyboardist of [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]] until 1994. Signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville in 2005, Hot Apple Pie released its [[Hot Apple Pie (album)|self-titled debut album]] that year.

==History==
Brady Seals was a keyboardist and co-lead vocalist (alongside [[Tim Rushlow]]) in the country band [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]] until late 1994, when he left in pursuit of a solo career.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p702108/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Hot Apple Pie biography |accessdate=2008-04-04 |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Between then and the early 2000s, Seals recorded three albums, and charted six singles on the country charts.

After deciding that his solo career was not proving successful, Seals opted to form a second band. Guitarist [[Mark Matejka|Mark "Sparky" Matejka]] and drummer Trey Landry, both of whom had backed Seals during his solo career, were recruited, with bass guitarist Keith Horne completing the lineup.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1505443/hot-apple-pie-leaves-the-oven.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926120225/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1505443/hot-apple-pie-leaves-the-oven.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 26, 2008 |title=Hot Apple Pie Leaves the Oven |accessdate=2008-04-04 |last=Morris |first=Edward |work=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> These three musicians all had experience prior to the band's foundation. Matejka had played for [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]] and [[Charlie Daniels]]; Landry, for [[Rodney Crowell]] and [[Suzy Bogguss]]; and Horne, for [[Waylon Jennings]].<ref name="cmt"/>

In 2005, Hot Apple Pie signed to [[DreamWorks Records]]' Nashville division.<ref name="allmusic"/> That year, they released its debut album, also entitled ''[[Hot Apple Pie (album)|Hot Apple Pie]]''. It produced three singles, all of which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: "Hillbillies", "We're Makin' Up" and "Easy Does It."<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=194|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Due to the dissolution of DreamWorks Records in late 2005, these latter two singles were issued on [[MCA Nashville]]. The band exited this label in 2006, the same year that Matejka left to join the [[Southern rock]] band [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]].<ref name="skynyrd">{{cite web |url=http://www.therockradio.com/2006/06/lynyrd-skynyrd-hope-to-team-up-with.html |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd hope to team up with George Jones |accessdate=2008-04-04 |date=2006-06-14 |work=The Rock Radio}}</ref> Kevin Ray took Matjeka's place in 2006. Seals released another solo album in mid-2009.
