'''James Andrew House''' (born March 22, 1955) is an American [[country music]] artist. Originally a member of a group called the House Band, he recorded a solo rock album in 1983 on Atlantic Records before he began his country music career in 1989 on [[MCA Records]], recording two albums for that label. He later penned singles for [[Diamond Rio]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]], before finding another record deal on [[Epic Records]] in 1994. That year, he charted two Top 40 singles on the ''Billboard'' country chart, including the Top 10 hit "[[This Is Me Missing You]]".

==Biography==
James House's musical career began in a band called the House Band, which was signed first to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and later to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="oldies">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/James-House.html |title=James House Biography {{pipe}} OLDIES.com |publisher=oldies.com|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> In addition, House served as vocal coach for [[Dustin Hoffman]] on the movie ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]''.<ref name="oldies"/> In 1983, House recorded a rock album for Atlantic.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Orange Coast Magazine|date=September 1987|publisher=Emmis Communications|issn=0279-0483|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_OWEEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_OWEEAAAAMBAJ/page/n127 126]|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref>

House later moved to Nashville and signed as a solo artist on [[MCA Nashville]] in 1989. On that label, he recorded two albums: ''James House'' and ''Hard Times for an Honest Man''. The former accounted for "Don't Quit Me Now", a number 25 on the country charts, while the latter produced no Top 40 hits. House wrote seven of the ten songs on his first album.<ref>{{cite journal|date=April 14, 1989|title=New Artist Fact File|journal=[[Radio & Records]]|page=70|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-04-14.pdf}}</ref>

In 1990, House was shortlisted for the [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1990/BB-1990-02-03.pdf|title=ACM Selects Nominees For 25th Annual Awards|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=44, 46|date=February 3, 1990}}</ref>

After exiting MCA, he co-wrote "[[Ain't That Lonely Yet]]" for [[Dwight Yoakam]] and "[[In a Week or Two]]" by [[Diamond Rio]], both of which peaked at number 2 on the [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart in the early 1990s. By 1994, House had signed to [[Epic Records]]. His first album for that label, ''[[Days Gone By (James House album)|Days Gone By]]'', was released that year, producing his highest-charting single in the top 10 "[[This Is Me Missing You]]". The album's title track, while not a single, was featured in the soundtrack for the movie ''[[The Cowboy Way (film)|The Cowboy Way]]''.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109493/soundtrack |title=The Cowboy Way (1994) – Soundtracks – IMDb |publisher=imdb.com|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> In addition, the album featured collaborations with [[Raul Malo]], [[Trisha Yearwood]] and [[Nikki Nelson]].

Although House never entered Top 40 on the country music charts again after "This Is Me Missing You", he made an appearance on [[The Beach Boys]]' album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'', which featured re-recordings of Beach Boys songs with country music artists. He also continued to write songs for other artists. In late 1997, [[Martina McBride]] reached the top of the country charts with "[[A Broken Wing]]", which House co-wrote.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041209/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1490050/20040809/akins_rhett.jhtml CMT.com : Sam Hogin, Co-Writer of "A Broken Wing," Dies]</ref> House also contributed three songs to [[Steve Holy]]'s debut album ''[[Blue Moon (Steve Holy album)|Blue Moon]]''. He also co-wrote six songs on [[Steve Azar]]'s 2009 album ''[[Slide On Over Here]]'', on which he also played acoustic guitar, percussion and sang backing vocals.<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media notes |title=Slide On Over Here |others=Steve Azar |year=2009 |type=CD insert |publisher=Ride Records |id=094922 863287}}</ref> In 2012, House co-wrote [[The Mavericks]]' single "Born to Be Blue".<ref name="musicrow">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2012/06/publishing-news/|title=Publishing News : MusicRow – Nashville's Music Industry Publication – News, Songs From Music City|date=June 5, 2012 |publisher=musicrow.com|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref>
