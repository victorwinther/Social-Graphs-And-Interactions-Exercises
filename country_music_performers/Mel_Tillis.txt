== Early life ==
Mel Tillis was born in [[Tampa, Florida]], US. His parents were Burma ([[Given name#Name at birth|née]] Rogers; 1907–1990) and Lonnie Lee Tillis (1907–1981).<ref name=nyt>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/obituaries/mel-tillis-dead.html |title= Mel Tillis, Country Star Known for His Songs and His Stutter, Dies at 85 |first=Bill |last= Friskics-Warren |date=November 19, 2017 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]}}</ref> While he was still young, the family moved to [[Pahokee, Florida]] (near [[West Palm Beach]]). After a bout of [[malaria]] during his childhood, he developed a stutter.<ref name="Ankeny">{{Cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1839/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography: Mel Tillis |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website= [[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 8, 2010}}</ref> As a child, Tillis learned the drums as well as guitar. At age 16, he won a local talent show. 

He attended the [[University of Florida]], but he dropped out and joined the [[United States Air Force]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sexton |first=Scott |title=Legend's Corner – Mel Tillis |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/meltillis/a/LC_MTillis.htm |date= July 2007 |website=About.com Country Music |access-date=May 23, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110412071041/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/meltillis/a/LC_MTillis.htm |archive-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While stationed as a baker on [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], he formed a band called The Westerners, which played at local nightclubs.<ref name="Ankeny" />

==Early music career==
After leaving the Air Force in 1955,<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]| editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]| publisher= [[Guinness Publishing]] |date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=408/9}}</ref> Tillis returned to Florida where he worked a number of odd jobs, eventually finding employment with the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in Tampa. He used his railroad pass to visit Nashville and eventually met and auditioned for [[Wesley Rose]] of the publishing house [[Acuff-Rose Music]]. Rose encouraged Tillis to return to Florida and continue honing his songwriting skills.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dauphin |first=Chuck |title=Mel Tillis Eyes New Book, Greatest Hits Album |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/1550572/mel-tillis-eyes-new-book-greatest-hits-album |date=March 4, 2013 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=May 23, 2014}}</ref> Tillis eventually moved to Tennessee, and began writing songs full-time. He wrote "I'm Tired",<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> a No.&nbsp;3 country hit for [[Webb Pierce]] in 1957.<ref name="Ankeny" /> Other Tillis hits include "[[Honky Tong Song]]" and "Tupelo County Jail".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Brenda Lee]] also charted hits with Tillis' material around this time. In the late 1950s, after becoming a hit-making songwriter, he signed his own contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name= "LarkinCountry"/> In 1958, he had his first Top 40 hit, "The Violet and a Rose",<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> followed by the Top 25 hit "Sawmill".

==Rise to fame==
Although Tillis charted his own hits on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Country Songs]] list, he had more success as a songwriter, particularly for Webb Pierce. He wrote the hits "I Ain't Never" (Tillis' own future hit) and "Crazy, Wild Desire". [[Bobby Bare]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] ("[[Detroit City (song)|Detroit City]]"), [[Wanda Jackson]], and [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] also covered his songs. (Some well-known songs from his Columbia years include "The Brooklyn Bridge", "Loco Weed", and "Walk on, Boy".) In 1967 [[Jack Greene]] had a No. 1 hit with a song Tillis co-wrote, "[[All the Time (Kitty Wells song)|All the Time]]". Tillis continued to record on his own, but did not achieve major success on the country charts at first.

In the mid-1960s, Tillis switched to [[Kapp Records]], and in 1965, he had his first Top 15 hit with "Wine". Other hits continued to follow, such as "Stateside" and "Life Turned Her That Way", which was later covered by [[Ricky Van Shelton]] in 1988, going to No. 1.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He wrote for [[Charley Pride]] ("The Snakes Crawl At Night")<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and wrote "[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]", which was a hit for [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He also wrote the hit "Mental Revenge" for [[outlaw country]] star [[Waylon Jennings]]. It has also been covered by the [[Hacienda Brothers]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Gram Parsons]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], and [[Jamey Johnson]]. In 1968, Tillis achieved his first Top 10 hit with "Who's Julie". He also was a regular featured singer on ''The [[Porter Wagoner]] Show''.

==Height of his career==
[[File:See and hear Mel Tillis, 1970.png|thumb|Mel Tillis (1970)]]
Things turned around in 1969 for Tillis. He finally achieved the success he always wanted with two Top 10 country hits, "These Lonely Hands of Mine"<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and "She'll Be Hanging Around Somewhere". In 1970, he reached the Top 5 with "Heart Over Mind", which peaked at No. 3 on the Hot Country Songs list. After this, Tillis' career as a country singer went into full swing. Hits soon came quite easily, such as "Heaven Everyday" (1970), "Commercial Affection" (1970), "Arms of a Fool" (1970), "Take My Hand" (a duet with [[Sherry Bryce]] in 1971),<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and "Brand New Mister Me" (1971). In 1972, Tillis achieved his first chart-topper with his version of his song "I Ain't Never".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Even though the song was previously a hit by Webb Pierce, Tillis' version is the better-known version of the two. Most of the above-mentioned song hits were recorded on [[MGM Records]], Tillis' record company in the early part of the decade.

After the success of "I Ain't Never", Tillis had another hit, which came close to No. 1 (reaching No. 3), titled "Neon Rose", followed by "Sawmill", which reached No. 2. "Midnight, Me and the Blues" was another near chart-topper in 1974. Other hits Tillis had on MGM include "Stomp Them Grapes" (1974), "Memory Maker" (1974), "Woman in the Back of My Mind" (1975), and his version of "Mental Revenge" (1976). Tillis achieved his biggest success with [[MCA Records]], with which he signed in 1976. It started with a pair of two No. 1 hits in 1976, "Good Woman Blues" and "[[Heart Healer]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In an interview, he mentioned having written five hits in one week. Thanks to this success, in 1976 Tillis won the [[Country Music Association Awards]]' most coveted award, Entertainer of the Year, and was also inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] that year. In 1977 he appeared on the game show ''[[Match Game]]''. He achieved another No. 1 in 1978 with "I Believe In You" and then again in 1979 with "Coca-Cola Cowboy",<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> which was put in the [[Clint Eastwood]] movie ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way but Loose]]'',<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> in which he also made a cameo appearance. Also in 1978, Tillis co-hosted a short-lived variety series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television, ''Mel and Susan Together'', with model [[Susan Anton]]. Other hits around this time included "Send Me Down to Tucson", "Ain't No California", and "I Got the Hoss". In mid-1979, Tillis switched to another record company, [[Elektra Records]].

After signing with Elektra, he continued to make hit songs such as "Blind In Love" and "Lying Time Again", both hits in 1979. Until 1981, Tillis remained on top of his game as one of country music's most successful vocalists of the era. "Your Body Is an Outlaw" went to No. 3 in 1980, followed by another Top 10 hit, "Steppin' Out". "Southern Rains" in 1981 was his last No. 1 hit.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> That same year, he released ''Mel and Nancy'', an album of duets with [[Nancy Sinatra]], which spawned two hit singles, the Top 30 hit "Texas Cowboy Night" and the double A-side, "Play Me or Trade Me/Where Would I Be". He remained with Elektra until 1982 before switching back to MCA for a brief period in 1983. That summer, he scored a Top 10 hit with "In The Middle Of The Night" and had his last Top 10 hit with "New Patches" in 1984. By this time, however, Tillis had built up a financial empire, thanks to investing in music publishing companies such as Sawgrass and Cedarwood. 

==Movie roles==
Tillis appeared in movies, including ''[[Cottonpickin' Chickenpickers]]'' (1967), ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]'' (1975), ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980), ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981), ''[[The Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984), ''[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]'' (2008), and comedy westerns ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]'' (1979) and ''[[Uphill All the Way]]'' (1986), in which he starred with fellow country singer [[Roy Clark]]. 

==Radio stations==
In 1979, Tillis acquired radio station [[KIXZ|KIXZ (AM)]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]], from Sammons-Ruff Associates, which converted from [[Top 40]] to country music and became a force in the [[Texas Panhandle]] region (the station is now known today as a News/Talk radio station). A short time later, Tillis acquired Amarillo, Texas, Rock FM station KYTX, which changed calls to KMML (a play on Tillis' stutter) (that station is now known today as [[KXSS-FM]], a Top 40 radio station and is currently still a sister station to KIXZ). Still later, he operated WMML in Mobile, Alabama. All of his stations were sold after a time for a healthy return. 

==Later career and projects==
Following his heyday in the 1970s, Tillis remained a songwriter in the 1980s, writing hits for [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Randy Travis]]. He also wrote his autobiography called ''Stutterin' Boy''. Tillis appeared as the television commercial spokesman for the fast-food restaurant chain [[Whataburger]] during the 1980s. He briefly signed with [[RCA Records]], as well as [[Mercury Records]], and later [[Curb Records]] in 1991. His last top-10 hit was in 1984 and his last top-40 country hit in 1988; like most country artists of the classic era, his recording career was dented by changes in the country music industry in the early 1990s. He also built a theater in [[Branson, Missouri]], where he performed on a regular basis until 2002. In 1998, he teamed with [[Bobby Bare]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Jerry Reed]] to form The [[Old Dogs (group)|Old Dogs]]. The group recorded a double album of songs penned entirely by [[Shel Silverstein]]. In July 1998, ''Old Dogs Volumes 1 and 2'' were released on the [[Atlantic Records]] label. A companion video, as well as a ''Greatest Hits'' album (composed of previously released material by each individual artist), were also available. 

The [[Grand Ole Opry]] inducted Tillis on June 9, 2007. He was inducted into the Opry by his daughter [[Pam Tillis|Pam]], and is the only person in the show's history to be welcomed into membership by their child. (In the 1990s, Pam became a very successful country music singer in her own right,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> with Top Ten hits like "[[Maybe It Was Memphis]]", "[[Shake the Sugar Tree]]" and the Number One "[[Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life)]]".) Along with being inducted into the Grand Ole Opry, it was announced on August 7 that year that Tillis, along with [[Ralph Emery]] and [[Vince Gill]], were to be inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

==Personal life and death==
Tillis had six children, including singer-songwriter [[Pam Tillis]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Pam recorded for [[Arista Nashville]] in the 1990s where she had multiple country hit singles such as "[[Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life)]]" and "[[Maybe It Was Memphis]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pam-tillis-mn0000001433/biography | title=Pam Tillis biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=June 6, 2022}}</ref> His son Mel "Sonny" Tillis Jr. is also a songwriter. Sonny co-wrote [[Jamie O'Neal]]'s 2001 hit single "[[When I Think About Angels]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20010814_sonny_tillis_teams_for_heavenly_tune_with_angels | title=Sonny Tillis Teams For Heavenly Tune With 'Angels' | publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] | date=August 13, 2001 | accessdate=June 6, 2022}}</ref>

Tillis suffered from several illnesses beginning in January 2016. On November 19, 2017, he died of respiratory failure in [[Ocala, Florida]], at age 85.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/obituaries/mel-tillis-dead.html | title=Mel Tillis, Country Star Known for His Songs and His Stutter, Dies at 85 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 19, 2017 | accessdate=June 5, 2022 | author=Bill Friskics-Warren}}</ref> After this, Sonny Tillis began touring as a tribute act to his father.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/cheatham/2018/09/25/fourth-annual-music-main-bring-big-names-ashland-city/1422640002/ | title=Mel Tillis Jr. joins lineup for Ashland City's Music on Main festival | work=The Tennessean | date=September 25, 2018 | access-date=March 1, 2019}}</ref>
