In pursuit of a music career, Conlee moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], by 1971. He signed to [[ABC Records]] in 1976.<ref name="allmusic"/> Conlee charted for the first time in 1978 with "Rose Colored Glasses", a No.&nbsp;5 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, as well as the title track on his 1978 debut album.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album produced his first two No. 1 hits with "Lady Lay Down" and "Backside of Thirty".<ref name="allmusic"/>

Following ABC's merger with [[MCA Records]], Conlee released his 1979 album ''Forever'' on MCA. Its singles, "Before My Time" (No. 2) and "Baby, You're Something" (No. 7), were top ten hits.<ref name="whitburn"/> A second MCA release, ''Friday Night Blues'', produced two more No.&nbsp;2 hits: the title track and "She Can't Say That Anymore". The song "What I Had with You" (No. 12) followed. The 1981 album, ''With Love'', accounted for yet another hit with "Miss Emily's Picture" (No. 2), which Conlee performed live on ''[[Hee Haw]]'' on January 3, 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvtime.com/en/show/72351/episode/7155463|title = Hee Haw - S12E15}}</ref>

Conlee's 1982 album ''Busted'' led off with a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Harlan Howard]] song of the [[Busted (Harlan Howard song)|same name]]. The album's last single, "Common Man", returned him to the top of the charts in 1983.<ref name="allmusic"/> Three more No. 1 hits came from the 1983 album ''In My Eyes'': "I'm Only in It for the Love" (co-written with [[Kix Brooks]]), the title track and "As Long as I'm Rockin' with You". MCA also released a ''Greatest Hits'' album in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/john-conlees-greatest-hits-mw0000651683|title = John Conlee's Greatest Hits - John Conlee &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|website = [[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

''Blue Highway'' in 1984, his last studio album for MCA, produced another No. 2 with "Years After You". A year later, a second ''Greatest Hits'' album produced his last MCA single with the No. 5 "Old School", before he moved to [[Columbia Records]]. Conlee's first Columbia release, ''Harmony'', gave him his last No. 1 hit with "Got My Heart Set on You" in 1986. A second and final album for Columbia, ''American Faces'', reached the Top 10 for the last time with "Domestic Life". This was followed by "Mama's Rockin' Chair" at No. 11 (his last Top 40 hit). From there, Conlee moved to [[16th Avenue Records]], releasing ''Fellow Travelers'' in 1989.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

In 2005, Conlee donated his concert performance of "Rose Colored Glasses" at the [[Wildhorse Saloon]] in Nashville, to benefit the Lymphatic Research Foundation in New York. Conlee sang his signature song and auctioned off a pair of "rose-colored glasses" with the proceeds going to LRF.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}
