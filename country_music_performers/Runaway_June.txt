'''Runaway June''' is an American [[country music]] group consisting of Stevie Woodward (lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica, autoharp), Jennifer Wayne (guitar, vocals), and Natalie Stovall (guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, vocals). Wayne co-founded the group in 2015 with Hannah Mulholland (mandolin, vocals) and Naomi Cooke (lead vocals). Wayne was a former member of [[Stealing Angels]] and had co-written singles for other singers prior to the group's foundation. Signed to [[BBR Music Group]]'s Wheelhouse imprint in 2015, the group charted two singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts prior to their breakthrough hit "[[Buy My Own Drinks]]" in 2018. This was the first of three singles from their 2019 studio album ''[[Blue Roses (Runaway June album)|Blue Roses]]''. Mulholland quit the group in 2020 and was replaced by Natalie Stovall, former lead singer of [[Natalie Stovall and the Drive]]; Cooke quit in 2022 and was replaced by Stevie Woodward.
