'''Carlton Ray Scott Jr.''' (born December 5, 1969, in [[Semora, North Carolina]]) is an American [[country music]] artist.  He first gained attention in 2005 with his debut album ''My Kind of Music'', and has since released eleven albums and two EPS.

==Career==
Scott has a distinctive southern voice and wears a cowboy hat. 
Warner Brothers released his debut album, ''My Kind of Music'', and its title track became a top 40 single in 2005.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.rayscott.com/bio |title=About Ray Scott |work=Ray Scott }}</ref>

Scott split from the Warner Brothers label two years later. He independently released ''Crazy Like Me'' (2008) and ''Rayality'' (2011), which gave him a physical product on the road and support from [[Sirius XM]].<ref name=procountry>{{cite web |url=https://procountrymusic.com/2019/09/02/nowhere-near-done-the-ray-scott-story-so-far/ |title="Nowhere Near Done;" The Ray Scott Story (So Far) |work=Pro Country |date= September 2, 2019}}</ref> "Drinkin Beer" and "Ain’t Always Thirsty" received Sirius airplay, as did one of his best-known singles: "Those Jeans" from the Rayality album, produced by Dave Brainard (Jerrod Neimann, Brandy Clark). Then came his 5th studio album in 2017 — ''Guitar for Sale'', produced by Michael Hughes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://countrymusicmatters.com/2017/06/15/ray-scott-celebrates-guitar-sale-fan-party-cmm-interview/ |title=Ray Scott Celebrates "Guitar For Sale" With A Fan Party – CMM Interview |date=June 15, 2017|first=Mary |last=Kay |work=Country Music Matters}}</ref>

Hughes and Scott paired up again for ''Honky Tonk Heart'', an EP released on March 1, 2019.  According to Scott, ""Honky Tonk Heart" is all about who I am, and it's an ode to all the troubadours out there runnin' up and down the highways keeping real country music alive because they love it, live it, and breathe it."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/ray-scott-acoustic-honky-tonk-heart/ |title=Ray Scott Puts Acoustic Twist on His Ode to the Troubadours |first= Lauren |last= Laffer |work=Sounds Like Nashville |date=January 18, 2019 }}</ref>

Scott's second EP, ''Nowhere Near Done'', was released in February 2020.<ref name=procountry />
