'''The Thompson Brothers Band''' was an American [[country music]] group formed in 1996. The band consisted of brothers Andy Thompson ([[lead vocals]]) and Matt Thompson ([[drum kit|drums]]) along with Mike Whitty ([[bass guitar]]). They recorded for [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] in the 1990s, releasing one album, an extended play, and two singles.

==History==
The Thompson Brothers were raised in [[Norwell, Massachusetts]].<ref name="whitburn"/> Andy Thompson told ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' that he gained an interest in country music after moving to an area of Massachusetts that had a country station. He, along with his brother Matt and bassist Mike Whitty, then formed a band which played at venues throughout [[New England]]. Many of the venues that they played had also hosted [[Jo Dee Messina]]. After moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the band attended [[Belmont University]]. They attended a listening party held by [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] for [[Jon Randall]], where a friend put a demo tape of theirs in to test a [[public address]] system. After an RCA representative heard the tape, he helped them sign with the label. RCA released a six-song [[extended play]] titled ''Cows on Mainstreet'' in 1996. The album featured four studio tracks and two live recordings.<ref name="cst">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=802|title=Thompson Brothers overcome handicap|last=Loy|first=Robert|date=September 1996|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>
