==Biography==
Copas was born in 1913 in [[Blue Creek, Ohio]], United States.<ref>"Cowboy Copas", in ''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', Kurt Wolff and Orla Duane, editors (Rough Guides, 2000) pp. 107-108</ref> He began performing locally at age 14, and appeared on [[WLW (AM)|WLW-AM]] and [[WKRC (AM)|WKRC-AM]] in [[Cincinnati]] during the 1930s. In 1940, he moved to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], where he performed on [[WNOX (AM)|WNOX-AM]] with his band, the Gold Star Rangers.

In 1943, Copas achieved national fame when he replaced [[Eddy Arnold]] as a vocalist in the [[Pee Wee King]] band, and began performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name="Larkin"/> His first solo single, "Filipino Baby", released by [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in 1946, hit number four on the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' country chart, and sparked the most successful period of his career.<ref name="Larkin"/>

While continuing to appear on the Opry, Copas recorded several other hits during the late 1940s and early 1950s, including "[[Signed Sealed and Delivered]]", "[[The Tennessee Waltz]]", "Tennessee Moon", "Breeze", "I'm Waltzing with Tears in My Eyes", "[[Candy Kisses (George Morgan song)|Candy Kisses]]", "Hangman's Boogie", and "The Strange Little Girl".<ref name="Larkin"/> Copas' 1952 single, "'Tis Sweet to Be Remembered", reached number eight on the ''Billboard'' country chart, but it was his final top-40 hit for eight years.

Although Copas did not maintain his popularity of the late 1940s through the next decade, he continued to perform regularly at the Grand Ole Opry, and appeared on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''. After a lackluster partnership with [[Dot Records]], Copas surged to the top of the charts again in 1960 with the biggest hit of his career, "[[Alabam (song)|Alabam]]", which remained number one for three months.<ref name="Larkin"/> Other major hits during his successful period with [[Starday Records]] in the early 1960s, including "Flat Top" and a remake of "Signed, Sealed And Delivered", held promising implications for the future of his career.<ref name="Larkin"/>

===Aircraft accident===
{{Main|1963 Camden PA-24 crash}}
On March 3, 1963, Copas, [[Patsy Cline]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]], and others performed at a benefit concert at the [[Memorial Hall (Kansas City, Kansas)|Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall]] in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], for the family of [[disc jockey]] Cactus Jack Call, who had died the previous December in an automobile accident.

On March 5, they left for Nashville in a [[Piper Comanche]] piloted by Copas' son-in-law (and Cline's manager), Randy Hughes. After stopping to refuel in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee]], the craft took off at 6:07&nbsp;pm [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CT]]. The plane flew into severe weather and crashed at 6:29&nbsp;pm in a forest near [[Camden, Tennessee]], 90 miles from their destination, with no survivors.<ref name=boar>{{cite web|url=http://members.boardhost.com/patsyclinemusic/msg/1362527954.html|title=What really happened in the Patsy Cline plane crash|author=Larry Jordan|date=March 5, 2013|website=Boardhost.com|access-date=November 29, 2015}}</ref> A stone marker, dedicated on July 6, 1996, marks the location of the crash.

Copas was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens]] in [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee]], in "Music Row" with Hawkins and other country music stars.
