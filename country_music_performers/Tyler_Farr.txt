== Career ==
Tyler Farr grew up in [[Garden City, Missouri]] and attended [[Missouri State University]] getting a degree in voice.

Billy Dukes of ''Taste of Country'' gave the song four stars out of five, calling Farr's voice "unique, but not distracting."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/tyler-farr-hot-mess/ |title=Tyler Farr, 'Hot Mess' – Song Review |date=December 14, 2011 |publisher=Tasteofcountry.com |access-date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> Following the merger of his original label, [[BNA Records]], Farr moved to [[Sony Music Nashville|Columbia Nashville]]<ref name="Columbia Nashville web site">{{cite web|title=Columbia Nashville|url=http://www.columbianashville.com/artists/tyler-farr|access-date=August 2, 2013}}</ref> and released his second single, "[[Hello Goodbye (Tyler Farr song)|Hello Goodbye]]". His third single, "[[Redneck Crazy (song)|Redneck Crazy]]", became his first Top 10 hit in 2013. Next was the top 3 hit "[[Whiskey in My Water]]". All four singles were included on his debut album, ''[[Redneck Crazy]]'' which was released on September 30, 2013.

Farr led off his second album in mid-2014 with "[[A Guy Walks Into a Bar (song)|A Guy Walks Into a Bar]]". The album, entitled ''[[Suffer in Peace]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stephenson|first1=Troy|title=Tyler Farr To Release Sophomore Album 'Suffer In Peace' On April 28|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2015/02/tyler-farr-to-release-sophomore-album-suffer-in-peace-on-april-28/|access-date=February 23, 2015|work=[[MusicRow]]|date=February 23, 2015}}</ref> was released on April 28, 2015, and "A Guy Walks Into a Bar" became Farr's first No.&nbsp;1 single on ''Billboard'' Country Airplay in May 2015. The album's second single, "[[Withdrawals (Tyler Farr song)|Withdrawals]]"  was released to country radio on June 15, 2015. It had only reached number 52 on the Country Airplay chart when it was pulled from radio and "Better in Boots" was issued as a third single on August 17, 2015. The decision to change the single was made in order to give Farr an up-tempo, "female friendly" song that he could sing live, according to Steve Hodges of Sony Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitsdailydouble.com/news&id=297450|title=HITS Daily Double : Rumor Mill – TRIANGLE OFFENSE}}</ref>

"Our Town", Farr's eighth single release, was issued in late 2016. Singer [[Seth Ennis]] co-wrote the song.

In September 2018, Farr parted ways with [[Sony Music Nashville]]. Farr signed with [[Broken Bow Records]] in March 2019<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=10523|title=Farr signs with Aldean's label|magazine=[[Country Standard Time]]|date=March 25, 2019|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> under [[Jason Aldean]]'s newly-founded imprint Night Train Records, and released the EP ''Only Truck in Town'' on June 5, 2020. The title track and "Soundtrack to a Small Town Sundown" were released as singles.

== Musical styles ==

Farr is also a classically trained [[opera]] singer and took voice lessons during his teenage years; he sang tenor in Missouri's All-State Choir during his senior year of high school. He claims he discovered (and fell in love with) country music after his mother married [[George Jones]]' touring guitarist.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131110183142/http://www.cmt.com/news/cmt-offstage/1716697/tyler-farr-from-opera-to-george-jones-to-redneck-crazy.jhtml "Tyler Farr: From Opera to George Jones to 'Redneck Crazy'"], CMT.com, November 1, 2013.
