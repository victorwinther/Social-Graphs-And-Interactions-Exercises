In 1994 he co-founded [[Dead Reckoning Records]] along with [[Kieran Kane]], [[Tammy Rogers]], [[Mike Henderson]] and [[Harry Stinson (musician)|Harry Stinson]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The following year ''Life Down Here on Earth'' was published and in 1999 ''Beneath My Wheels''. The majority of songs are Welch's originals. In 2002 the album ''Millionaire'' was recorded partially in Nashville and mostly in Denmark with a stellar line-up of Scandinavian players.

In 2004 Welch teamed up with fellow Dead Reckoning artists Kieran Kane and [[Fats Kaplin]] to produce ''You Can't Save Everybody''. The trio followed this up with ''Lost John Dean'' in 2006, to general acclaim. ''Lost John Dean'' reached number one on the Americana charts, and resulted in nominations for several awards including Duo/Group of the year at the 2006 Americana Honors and Awards. The following eponymous Kane Welch Kaplin, with the addition of Lucas Kane, was also nominated for Duo/Group. The group traveled to Australia 10 times, as well as Europe and the UK, Canada, and all over the United States.

Throughout the 2000s, Welch has teamed up with Australian band [[The Flood (band)|The Flood]]. They have recorded albums and DVDs together, and toured the country twice.

Welch moved to [[Wimberley, Texas]], on April 1, 2008. In 2009, he recorded ''[[A Patch of Blue Sky|A Patch Of Blue Sky]]'', his first solo project in 8 years. He now lives in Australia with his wife, Sarah, and their family.
