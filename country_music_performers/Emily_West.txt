Signed to [[Capitol Records]] Nashville, she debuted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in early 2008 with the single "Rocks in Your Shoes". This song peaked at No.&nbsp;39 early in the year, and is the first single from a self-titled EP. She entered the country charts a second time with "Blue Sky", a duet with [[Keith Urban]], in 2010.

In 2012, West guest-starred in ''[[Body of Proof]]''.

Since her success on the show, West has toured extensively throughout the United States, first with her [[One-person show|one-woman show]] and then with America's Got Talent Live: The All-Stars Tour!

==Early life==
West, the youngest of four children, was born in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. In July 1994 her parents took her to Bird-On-Fire Recording Studio in West Union, Iowa where studio owner Doug Koempel worked with her producing four demos: "Sweet Dreams", "Piece Of My Heart", "Higher Love" and "Me And Bobby McGee."  She moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2000 following her graduation from [[Waterloo West High School]] in hopes of achieving her goals of becoming a country music singer.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Neal |first=Chris |date=April 2, 2008|title=Who's New: Emily West |journal=[[Country Weekly]] |volume=15 |issue=8 |page=13}}</ref> West soon signed a deal with a publishing company in Nashville, Warner-Chapell.

==Career==

===2007–2012: Music and television===
Capitol released a self-titled EP December 11, 2007, to the [[iTunes]] music store. In early 2008, West was featured in ''People'' magazine and completed a media tour for her debut single, "Rocks in Your Shoes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2musicgeeks.com/blog/?p=91 |title=2 Music Geeks' Podcast 13: Lucky—Featuring Emily West |access-date=May 12, 2008 |work=www.2musicgeeks.com }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> "Rocks in Your Shoes" peaked in the Top 40 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in early 2008. A second single, "That Kind of Happy" was released in April 2009 and failed to enter the chart.

West appeared on ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' on September 25, 2009, winning $25,000. In January 2010, West released a duet with labelmate [[Keith Urban]] titled "Blue Sky." The song debuted at No.&nbsp;53 on the Hot Country Songs chart for the week of February 23, 2010. Roughstock gave the song 4½ stars out of 5, stating that {{"'}}Blue Sky' is already a contender for one of 2010's best singles."<ref>[http://www.roughstock.com/blog/emily-west-blue-sky- Emily West (Featuring Keith Urban) – "Blue Sky"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328225123/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/emily-west-blue-sky- |date=March 28, 2010}}, By: Matt Bjorke, Last Updated: March 23, 2010, Roughstock</ref> It spent thirteen weeks on the charts and peaked at No.&nbsp;38.

Emily appeared in the April 18, 2010, episode of ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 9)|Celebrity Apprentice]]'', as the "music make-over" target for the women's team led by [[Cyndi Lauper]]. Lauper won the challenge and as a result West donated 100% of the first month of [[iTunes]] sales of her song "Blue Sky" to the Stonewall Community Foundation, Lauper's charity.

She appeared in the January 10, 2012 "Shades of Blue" episode on ''[[Body of Proof]]'' on ABC. She played a drug addict trying to make it in the music business. She sings her single "Head On" at the end of the episode: Season 2 episode 12 in "Body of Proof." She shows herself to be a terrific actress & singer.
