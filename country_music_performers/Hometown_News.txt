'''Hometown News''' was an American [[country music]] duo composed of singer-songwriters Ron Kingery and Scott Whitehead, both of whom were vocalists and guitarists.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p529525/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Hometown News > Biography ))) |accessdate=2007-07-19 |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Hometown News has recorded two independently released albums, in addition to charting two singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts. Their highest-peaking single, "Minivan", reached No.&nbsp;37 in 2002.

==History==
Before the duo's formation, Ron Kingery worked as a studio engineer for various country music artists in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in addition to writing children's music. Scott Whitehead, a graduate of the University of Tennessee at Martin and formerly a pilot for the [[United States Navy]], was also working a songwriter in Nashville, when he met Kingery at a songwriter's workshop in 1996.<ref name="about">{{cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blhometownnewsrev.htm |title=CD Review: Wheels - Hometown News |accessdate=2007-07-22 |last=Bjorke |first=Matt |work=[[About.com]] |archive-date=2002-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021202154727/http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blhometownnewsrev.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="ford">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordentertainment.com/artistdetail.aspx?ArtistID=20681 |title=Ford Entertainment & Productions |accessdate=2007-07-22 |work=Ford Entertainment.com}}</ref> In addition, the duo appeared on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as well as playing gigs at several military bases.

==Recording career==
The duo were then signed to VFR Records in 2002, recording their album ''Wheels'' that year. The album produced two singles in its title track and "Minivan", the latter a Top 40 hit. Shortly afterward, the duo embarked on a tour of the United States, sponsored by the [[Ford Motor Company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2002/02/21/036106.html |title="Hometown News" Sets Off On Minivan PromotionalTour'' |accessdate=2007-07-22 |work=The Auto Channel.com}}</ref> VFR closed in 2002, however, and the duo was left without a record deal.

Hometown News sang "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" and "[[God Bless America]]" at game six of the 2004 National League Championship Series at [[Busch Stadium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

In 2005, Hometown News signed to the independent Quarterback Records label. Their second album, ''Hometown News'', was released in 2006,<ref name="allmusic"/> although it did not produce any  chart singles.

Whitehead died on March 12, 2021, of unknown causes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/scott-whitehead-hometown-news-dead/|title = Scott Whitehead of Early 2000s Duo Hometown News Dies|website = The Boot}}</ref>
