In 1997, after moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], she was signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Released in 1997, her debut album, ''[[Back to You (album)|Back to You]]'', was produced by her as well. She co-wrote all but one of the album's songs and played several instruments on it. The album's lead-off single, "I Could Love a Man Like That", peaked at No.&nbsp;64, followed by the No.&nbsp;69 "Daddy, Can You See Me". The third single, a duet with [[Steve Wariner]] titled "What If I Said", reached the top of the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts in early 1998.<ref name="allmusic"/> Following this song was the album's fourth and final single, "Will You Be Here?" also at No.&nbsp;69. Her second album, ''Anita'', produced three singles, all of which failed to reach the top 40.

For the first single from her third album, ''God Created Woman'', Cochran spliced in [[Conway Twitty]]'s vocals from earlier songs of his to form a duet entitled "(I Wanna Hear) A Cheatin' Song".<ref>[https://archive.today/20130628221013/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1488119/conway-twitty-sings-a-song-he-never-heard.jhtml Conway Twitty Sings a Song He Never Heard]</ref> This song peaked at No.&nbsp;57; the album was never released.

In 2007, Cochran produced country music singer [[Tammy Cochran]]'s album ''Where I Am''. The two singers are not related.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsal/fr/WhereIAm.htm|title=Tammy Cochran – ''Where I Am''|publisher=countrymusic.about.com|accessdate=October 2, 2010|archive-date=April 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415212913/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsal/fr/WhereIAm.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>
