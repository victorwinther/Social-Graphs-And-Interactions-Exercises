Newfield, pictured in a faded "NRA Country" ballcap for ''American Hunter'' magazine discussed her favorite types of hunting and her love of the outdoors. The [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] named Heidi Newfield as their NRA Country Artist of the Month, October 2012.  In the article Newfield discussed life on the road and her genuine love of the outdoors.  She was quoted as saying that her favorite hunting season is deer season because of the cold weather and football.  Newfield talks about enjoying "wild hog roasts and big, warm fires" in addition to hunting blacktail deer near her home in Northern California.  Further, Newfield shared with NRA Country that "Country is much more than the place you were born and raised.  To me, it’s about having a love for our beautiful land and a respect for this great nation’s founding principles.  I’ve been lucky enough to travel across the U.S. and I think it’s the best place on earth.  I’m Heidi Newfield and I am NRA Country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2012/10/03/heidi-newfield-is-octobers-nra-country-artist-of-the-month/|title=Heidi Newfield is October's NRA Country Artist of the Month|date=October 1, 2012|work=Great American Country (GAC)|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>
