==Career==
In 2000, Presley moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she landed a publishing deal nine months later. Through her publisher she met [[Ashley Monroe]], who later brought Presley's music to the attention of her friend [[Miranda Lambert]]. The three artists began working together writing songs, which would later become [[Pistol Annies]]' debut album ''[[Hell on Heels]]'', released on August 23, 2011. The group spent much of the next two years touring North America and writing songs for their follow-up album. On May 7, 2013, Pistol Annies released their second album ''[[Annie Up]]''. On June 17, 2013, the [[RIAA]] announced that the album and single for ''[[Hell on Heels]]'' had both sold in excess of 500,000 copies, giving [[Pistol Annies]] their first [[Gold Record]]. In 2014 Presley released her solo album ''[[American Middle Class (album)|American Middle Class]]'', co-produced with her husband [[Jordan Powell]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/6281684/angaleena-presley-american-middle-class-review|title=Album Review: Pistol Annies' Angaleena Presley's 'American Middle Class' a Strong, Focused Debut|magazine=Billboard|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref> In 2017, Presley released her second solo album, [[Wrangled]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wrangled-Angaleena-Presley/dp/B06WP59M9T|title=Angaleena Presley – Wrangled – Amazon.com.com Music|accessdate=May 4, 2017|asin=B06WP59M9T}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Angaleena Presley was born in [[Martin County, Kentucky]], and raised in [[Beauty, Kentucky]]. Her father Jimmy Presley Sr., is a retired coal miner and her mother, Cathy Presley (née McCoy), is a retired school teacher. At age 15, her father taught her how to play her first song on his guitar, "[[Mama Tried (song)|Mama Tried]]" by [[Merle Haggard]]. She attended [[Sheldon Clark High School]] in [[Inez, Kentucky]], and graduated in 1994 before attending college at [[Eastern Kentucky University]]. Presley started work as a songwriter in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 2002, and later wrote the song "Knocked Up" from her own personal experience of being pregnant and unmarried. She has a son, Jed, born in 2007. When the Pistol Annies were first forming in the early 2010s, Presley was going through a divorce. She insists her upbringing was not "the stark, poverty-stricken one as committed to record on the '[[Coal Miner's Daughter (song)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]' by [[Loretta Lynn]]. That doesn't mean the Presleys didn't struggle, however, or that the singer led a charmed life once she left Beauty."<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Angaleena Presley Opens Up About Beer, Babies and Pistol Annie Brawls| last=Betts |first=Stephen L. |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/angaleena-presley-opens-up-about-beer-babies-and-pistol-annie-brawls-188148/amp/|magazine=Rolling Stone |date=October 15, 2014|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonestarmusic.com/AngaleenaPresley|title=Angaleena Presley|website=Lone Star Music|access-date=October 11, 2017}}</ref> On May 22, 2012, she married manager/producer [[Jordan Powell]] in a small ceremony in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theboot.com/angaleena-presley-married/|title=Pistol Annies' Angaleena Presley Weds Miranda Lambert's Tour Manager|website=The Boot|date=May 25, 2012 |access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref> On August 15, 2018, Presley confirmed she was pregnant with her second child (her first with Powell) and gave birth to their daughter Joeleena in January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/parents/angaleena-presley-pregnant-expecting-second-child/|title=Pistol Annies' Angaleena Presley 'Shocked and Overjoyed' to Be Expecting Second Child at 41|website=People|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2019/01/24/angaleena-presley-husband-welcome-baby-girl-phoenix-joeleena-jean/|title=Angaleena Presley & Husband Welcome Baby Girl, Phoenix Joeleena Jean|date=January 24, 2019|website=Nash Country Daily|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>
