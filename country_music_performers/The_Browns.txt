'''The Browns''' were an American [[country music|country]] and [[folk music]] vocal trio best known for their 1959 [[Grammy]]-nominated hit, "[[The Three Bells]]". The group, composed of [[Jim Ed Brown]] and his sisters [[Maxine Brown (country singer)|Maxine]] and [[Bonnie Brown (musician)|Bonnie]], had a close, smooth harmony characteristic of the [[Nashville sound]], though their music also combined elements of [[folk song|folk]] and [[pop music|pop]]. They disbanded in 1967 and were elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in March 2015.

==History==
James Edward, older sister Maxine, and younger sister Bonnie Brown sang individually in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], until 1954, when Maxine and Jim Ed signed a record contract as a singing duo. They earned national recognition and a guest spot on [[Ernest Tubb]]'s radio show for their self-penned song "Looking Back to See",<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Who's Who of Fifties Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-732-0|page=54}}</ref> which hit the top ten and stayed on the charts through the summer of 1954.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/browns/bio.jhtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040604024139/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/browns/bio.jhtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = June 4, 2004 | title = The Browns Biography | publisher = Country Music Television, Inc. |author1=Brennan, Sandra |author2=Manheim, James |name-list-style=amp | access-date = 2009-03-24}}</ref> The song would be a hit again nearly 20 years later for [[Buck Owens]] and [[Susan Raye]] in 1972.

They were joined in 1955 by then-recent high school graduate, 18-year-old Bonnie, and began performing on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].<ref name="Larkin50"/> By the end of 1955, the trio was appearing on [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]], and had another top ten hit with "Here Today and Gone Tomorrow",<ref name="Larkin50"/> which got a boost by their appearances on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', which Maxine Brown called "our real breakthrough."<ref>{{cite book| author=Brown, Maxine| year = 2005| title=Looking Back to See: A Country Music Memoir| publisher=University of Arkansas Press| location=Fayetteville| isbn =1-55728-790-2 }}, p. 111</ref> Jim Ed and Maxine had first appeared on the show as a duo in 1955. Producer [[Si Siman]] signed them with [[RCA Victor]] in 1956, and soon they had two major hits, "[[I Take the Chance]]" (a cover of a [[Louvin Brothers]] composition that showed the Browns' close harmony) and "I Heard the Bluebirds Sing".<ref name="Larkin50"/> When Jim Ed was drafted in 1957, the group continued to record while he was on leave, and sister Norma filled in for him on tours,<ref name="autogenerated1"/> as did [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Brown, Maxine| year = 2005| title=Looking Back to See: A Country Music Memoir| publisher=University of Arkansas Press| location=Fayetteville| isbn =1-55728-790-2 }}, p. 116</ref>

In 1959, The Browns scored their biggest hit when their folk-pop [[single (music)|single]] "[[The Three Bells]]"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19759/m1/ |title=Show 11 - Tennessee Firebird. &#91;Part 3&#93;, Big Rock Candy Mountain. &#91;Part 1&#93; - All TracksDigital Library |access-date=2017-10-30 |archive-date=2017-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709220959/https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19759/m1/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[pop music|pop]] and country charts.<ref name="Larkin50"/> The song also peaked at No. 10 on ''Billboard's'' Rhythm and Blues listing. Based on a song called "{{Lang|fr|[[Les trois cloches]]|italic=no}}", it was originally a hit in [[France]] for [[Ã‰dith Piaf]].  It was merely a coincidence that the hit rendition by the Browns chronicles the life of a character named "Jimmy Brown".<ref name="Larkin50"/> The recording sold over one million copies,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

The Browns appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and followed up with "[[Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)]]" and "[[The Old Lamplighter]]", recordings that also did well on both the pop and country charts.<ref name="Larkin50"/> With an international following, they toured [[Europe]] extensively and saw further moderate success on the country music charts.<ref name="Larkin50"/> In 1963, they joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{cite web

Jim Ed began recording as a solo artist for RCA Victor in 1965,<ref name="Larkin50"/> and these efforts quickly began overshadowing the trio's recordings. Maxine sang lead vocal on the group's final singles released in 1968, "Big Daddy" and "I Will Bring You Water," with Jim Ed only supplying background vocals. The trio officially disbanded that year and Maxine signed with [[Chart Records]] in 1969, resulting in a small hit with "Sugar Cane County".<ref name="Larkin50"/>

In the 1980s, The Browns began performing occasionally in concert for the first time in nearly 20 years. In 2006, the trio performed "The Old Lamplighter" and "The Three Bells" for the [[PBS]] special, ''Country Pop Legends''.

On June 11, 2015, Jim Ed Brown died from lung cancer at age 81.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/06/11/country-singer-jim-ed-brown-dies/71097224/ |title=Country singer Jim Ed Brown dies at 81|first1=Juli|last1=Thanki|first2=Cindy|last2=Watts|work=[[The Tennessean]]|date=June 12, 2015|access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> On July 16, 2016, Bonnie Brown also died from lung cancer at the age of 77.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/07/16/country-music-hall-famer-bonnie-brown-dead-77/74691904/ |title=Country Music Hall of Famer Bonnie Brown dead at 77 |website=Tennessean.com |date=2015-07-16 |access-date=2016-07-16}}</ref> Maxine Brown died on January 21, 2019, at the age of 87 from complications of heart and kidney disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsmv.com/news/country-musician-maxine-brown-of-the-browns-dies-at/article_54cce3fa-1dd9-11e9-913e-f344fb787800.html|title=Country musician Maxine Brown of The Browns dies at 86|first=Joey|last=Gill|website=WSMV Nashville|access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref>
