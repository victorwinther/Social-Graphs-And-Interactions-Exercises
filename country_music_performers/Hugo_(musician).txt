'''Hugo Chakrabongse Levy''' (born 6 August 1981), known under the mononym '''Hugo''' or Thai name '''Chulachak Chakrabongse''' ({{lang-th|จุลจักร จักรพงษ์}}; {{RTGS|''Chunlachak Chakkraphong''}}) is a Thai American actor and singer-songwriter. Based in New York City and signed to [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] label, his musical style has been dubbed by Roc Nation as "gangsta-rock". He is best known for his bluegrass re-working of Jay-Z's "[[99 Problems]]". His debut album, ''Old Tyme Religion'', was released on 10 May 2011. He can trace direct royal heritage back from his maternal great-grandfather, Prince [[Chakrabongse Bhuvanath]], a son of King [[Chulalongkorn|Rama V]] of Thailand, and is a [[Cousin#Relationship charts|second cousin once removed]] of the King of Thailand, King [[Vajiralongkorn]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hugo Chakrabongse: From 'trash' in Thailand to triumph in the United States {{!}} CNN Travel|url = http://travel.cnn.com/bangkok/life/thailands-royal-rocker-542559|website =Travel.cnn.com|accessdate = 13 November 2015}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Levy was born in London to [[Mom Rajawongse|M.R.]] [[Narisa Chakrabongse]], raised in Thailand near the [[Chao Phraya River]], and used to live in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of New York City. Now he resides in Bangkok, Thailand. He is the grandson of Prince [[Chula Chakrabongse]], the great-grandson of Prince [[Chakrabongse Bhuvanath]], and the great-great-grandson of King [[Rama V]] of Siam. He is of English, Russian, Scottish, Thai and Ukrainian heritage. 

As a teenager, he released four studio albums with the band Siplor, which had several of its records banned on the radio. After moving to London, he became highly influenced by blues musicians such as [[Howlin' Wolf|Howling Wolf]], [[Son House]], [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Skip James]] as well as more modern musicians and bands such as [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[MGMT]], [[Tame Impala]], [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[The Big Pink]] and [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]]. He achieved recognition when his song "Disappear" was featured on [[Beyoncé]]'s album ''[[I Am...
