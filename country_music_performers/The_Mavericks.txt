'''The Mavericks''' are an American [[country music]] band from [[Miami]], Florida. The band consists of [[Raul Malo]] (lead vocals, bass guitar), Paul Deakin (drums), [[Eddie Perez (guitarist)|Eddie Perez]] (lead guitar), and Jerry Dale McFadden (keyboards). Malo and Deakin founded the band in 1989 along with Robert Reynolds (bass guitar) and Ben Peeler (lead guitar). After one independent album, the band was signed by [[MCA Nashville Records]] and [[David Lee Holt]] replaced Peeler on lead guitar; he would be replaced by Nick Kane shortly after their second MCA album and third overall 1994's ''[[What a Crying Shame]]''. The band recorded a total of four albums for MCA and one for [[Mercury Records]] before disbanding in 2000. They reunited for one album in 2003 on [[Sanctuary Records]], by which point Perez had become their fourth guitarist, and former touring keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden became an official fifth member. The lineup of Malo, Deakin, Reynolds, Perez, and McFadden reunited a second time in 2012 for a series of new albums, first on [[Big Machine Records]]' Valory imprint and then on Mono Mundo. Reynolds was fired in 2014 and Ed Friedland served as touring bassist until 2023, with Malo taking the role of bassist soon afterward.

The Mavericks have charted 15 times on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts; their highest-peaking single there is "[[All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down]]", a collaboration with accordionist [[Flaco Jiménez]] which reached number 13 in 1996. Three of their singles made top 10 on the country music charts of the defunct ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' magazine in Canada, and "[[Dance the Night Away (The Mavericks song)|Dance the Night Away]]" was a hit single in the United Kingdom in 1998. Their most commercially successful album ''What a Crying Shame'' has been [[music recording certification|certified platinum]] in the United States and double-platinum in Canada. In addition, the band has received one [[Grammy Award]], two [[Country Music Association]] awards, and three [[Academy of Country Music]] awards. Their sound is defined by a wide variety of musical styles outside of country music, such as [[Tejano music|Tejano]], [[Music of Latin America|Latin]], [[Americana music|Americana]], and the [[pop music]] of the 1950s, with particular emphasis on Malo's singing voice.

===1992{{ndash}}1993: ''From Hell to Paradise''===
Due to the independent album's success throughout the Miami music community, the band was invited to perform for a showcase in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at which talent scouts for major country music labels were present. One of these labels, [[MCA Nashville]], signed the band in May 1991.<ref name="allmusic"/> According to [[Colin Larkin]] in the ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', the band was signed before they had finished their [[soundcheck]].<ref name="virgin"/> Peeler was fired from his role as guitarist in October 1991 due to concerns from the other three band members and their then-manager that his playing was not suitable for a country music band.<ref name="move"/> He was replaced by [[David Lee Holt]], a [[session musician]] who had also played for [[Joe Ely]] and [[Carlene Carter]].<ref name="allmusic"/> After Holt joined, the band began recording their first MCA album ''[[From Hell to Paradise]]'' at Miami-based Criteria Studios late in 1991. Malo wrote the title track, which was about his parents emigrating from [[Cuba]] to the United States. He co-produced it with guitarists [[Richard Bennett (guitarist)|Richard Bennett]] and Steve Fishell, both of whom also played on the album.<ref name="move"/> The album was released in May 1992 and charted one single a month later: a cover of [[Hank Williams]]' "[[Hey, Good Lookin' (song)|Hey Good Lookin']]", which the band took to number 74 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|pages=226|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref> Sandra Schulman of the South Florida ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' wrote that this album "reflected their Miami roots with social issues of homelessness and immigrant rights shoehorned in with the boot-kicking country ballads".<ref name="unconventional"/>  Rating it "B+", [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that "Some of the group's writing could use a finer bead, but the Mavericks earn major points for integrating the [[hillbilly]] heart of the masters with the consciousness and muscle of the contemporary generation."<ref name="nash hell">{{cite web | last=Nash |first=Alanna | url=https://ew.com/article/1992/06/26/hell-paradise/ | title=''From Hell to Paradise'' review | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=June 26, 1992 | accessdate=February 10, 2022 | archive-date=February 11, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211045334/https://ew.com/article/1992/06/26/hell-paradise/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

Holt quit the band after only one album. Dale Martin, music reviewer for ''[[The Victoria Advocate]]'', attributed Holt's departure to "friction of some sort".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/432626007/ | title=Success no 'cryin' shame' for Mavericks | work=[[The Victoria Advocate]] | date=May 1, 1994 | accessdate=February 3, 2002 | author=Dale Martin | pages=2E | archive-date=February 4, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220204022842/https://www.newspapers.com/image/432626007/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Conversely, Karen Essex of ''New Country'' magazine stated that Holt left amicably.<ref name="thoroughly">{{cite journal | title=Thoroughly postmodern Mavericks | author=Karen Essex | journal=New Country | year=1995 | date=October 1995 | pages=38–46}}</ref> After leaving The Mavericks, Holt would become a founding member of the [[blues rock]] band [[Storyville (band)|Storyville]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/storyville-mn0000632257/biography | title=Storyville biography | work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network | accessdate=February 3, 2022 | author=John Bush | archive-date=December 24, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211224200544/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/storyville-mn0000632257/biography | url-status=live }}</ref> In 1993, The Mavericks chose Bill Dwyer to fill in on lead guitar while on tour in [[Europe]]. Reynolds told Mike Cooper of ''The Hard Report'' in July of that year that the band did not yet know who would replace Holt.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Hard-Report/1993/Hard-1993-07-30.pdf | title=Music Now! | author=Mike Cooper | journal=The Hard Report | pages=56 | date=July 30, 1993 | access-date=2022-02-04 | archive-date=2022-04-27 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220427063752/https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Hard-Report/1993/Hard-1993-07-30.pdf | url-status=live }}</ref>

===1994{{ndash}}1995: ''What a Crying Shame''===
The Mavericks' next MCA release was 1994's ''[[What a Crying Shame]]''. This was also their first to be produced by [[Don Cook]], best known for his work with [[Brooks & Dunn]].<ref name="allmusic"/> By the time of the album's release, Reynolds had selected Nick Kane, another friend of his, to become the band's third guitarist. Although Kane was pictured on the album's liner notes and in promotional material, the project was completed before his joining. As a result, [[Bruce Bouton]] and Mark Casstevens of [[Garth Brooks]]' studio band The G-Men played guitar on the album alongside session guitarist [[Brent Mason]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/walkin-with-a-kane-6364060 | title=Walkin' with a Kane | work=Miami New Times | date=December 29, 1993 | accessdate=February 3, 2022 | archive-date=February 4, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220204022842/https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/walkin-with-a-kane-6364060 | url-status=live }}</ref> It was also at this point that keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden began accompanying the band in concerts.<ref name="true to">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/158444329/ | title=Country music Mavericks are true to their name | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 21, 1994 | accessdate=February 10, 2022 | pages=F1, F2 | archive-date=February 11, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211051941/https://www.newspapers.com/image/158444329/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Malo wrote four of the album's ten songs with Greek-American songwriter [[Kostas (songwriter)|Kostas]], best known for his work with [[Patty Loveless]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]].

Writing for AllMusic, Steve Leggett stated that it was "a further step away from anything resembling a mainstream country release, incorporating not only the Tex-Mex and Cuban influences the band was known for, but also the rhythms of polkas, tangos, and all manner of approaches". He thought that these additional influences made the album an "extension" of their previous efforts.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-time-mw0002415265 | title=''In Time'' review |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Steve Leggett | archive-date=February 11, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211233248/https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-time-mw0002415265 | url-status=live }}</ref> Following this album, the band announced in early 2014 that they would honor their 25th anniversary with a tour throughout the United States and Canada, starting in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=7644 | title=The Mavs slate 25th anniversary tour | publisher=Country Standard Time | date=January 22, 2014 | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | archive-date=May 18, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210518200039/https://countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=7644 | url-status=live }}</ref>

For live shows, Reynolds moved from playing playing bass guitar to acoustic guitar; Ed Friedland was hired as the group's touring bassist. This was due to Reynolds having developed an addiction to [[opiate]]s that was affecting his playing. Also joining The Mavericks' touring band at this point were Max Abrams (saxophone, percussion), Matt Cappy (trumpet), and [[Michael Guerra]] (accordion).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elmoremagazine.com/2015/11/reviews/shows/the-mavericks-3 | title=The Mavericks The Space at Westbury | publisher=[[Elmore Magazine]] | date=November 11, 2015 | accessdate=June 6, 2022 | archive-date=March 16, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220316164103/http://www.elmoremagazine.com/2015/11/reviews/shows/the-mavericks-3 | url-status=live }}</ref> Reynolds was fired from the band in October 2014 after the other members learned that he was soliciting money from fans under false pretenses in order to support his addiction.

After being released from Valory in 2016, the band founded their own label Mono Mundo in association with [[Thirty Tigers]]. Their first release on their own label was a live album titled ''All Night Live, Volume 1''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=9479 | title=The Mavs face 'Brand New Day' | publisher=Country Standard Time | date=January 9, 2017 | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617204908/https://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=9479 | url-status=live }}</ref> This was followed by their next studio release, ''[[Brand New Day (The Mavericks album)|Brand New Day]]'', in March 2017.<ref name="allmusic"/> This, too, was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Americana Album the following year.<ref name="grammy"/> Deming contrasted the album favorably to ''Trampoline'', noting that the band continued to include Latin, Tejano, and "vintage [[pop music|pop]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/brand-new-day-mw0003016194 | title=''Brand New Day'' review |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Mark Deming | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617205031/https://www.allmusic.com/album/brand-new-day-mw0003016194 | url-status=live }}</ref> This was followed in 2018 by their first Christmas album, ''Hey!

This album consisted entirely of cover songs, including [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Hungry Heart]]", [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Don't Be Cruel]]", [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]", and [[Freddy Fender]]'s "[[Before the Next Teardrop Falls (song)|Before the Next Teardrop Falls]]" among others. Deming said of this album that "Even when the Mavericks don't necessarily make the songs their own, they know how to perform them with a conviction that elevates them from the work of another cover outfit".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/play-the-hits-mw0003325035 | title=''Play the Hits'' |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Mark Deming | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617204912/https://www.allmusic.com/album/play-the-hits-mw0003325035 | url-status=live }}</ref>

On August 21, 2020, the band released ''En Español,'' their first album entirely in the Spanish language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904366868/the-mavericks-are-back-this-time-en-espanol|title=The Mavericks Are Back, This Time 'En Español'|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=2020-08-24|archive-date=2024-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617204948/https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904366868/the-mavericks-are-back-this-time-en-espanol|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="allmusic"/> Deming stated in AllMusic that, while the album contained fewer country and pop influences than its predecessors, it also emphasized the band's Latin music roots more fully than previous projects. He concluded his review by stating that it was "adventurous and crafted with heart and skill, and that's what they've always done best."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/en-espa%C3%B1ol-mw0003394668 | title=''En Español'' |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Mark Deming | archive-date=February 12, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212000838/https://www.allmusic.com/album/en-espa%C3%B1ol-mw0003394668 | url-status=live }}</ref>

On June 27, 2024, Malo announced via social media that he had been diagnosed with [[intestinal cancer]]. Because of treatments, the band had to cancel several shows throughout the latter half of 2024.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.syracuse.com/music/2024/06/mavericks-singer-announces-he-has-cancer-and-then-goes-to-work-at-syracuses-jazz-fest-photos.html | last=Miller | first=Charlie | title=Mavericks singer announces he has cancer and then goes to work at Syracuse's Jazz Fest | website=Syracuse.com | date=June 28, 2024 | accessdate=June 28, 2024 | archive-date=June 28, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240628125232/https://www.syracuse.com/music/2024/06/mavericks-singer-announces-he-has-cancer-and-then-goes-to-work-at-syracuses-jazz-fest-photos.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Musical styles==
At the time of their signing with MCA, The Mavericks were seen as unusual in country music due not only to Malo's Cuban-American ancestry, but also to the band's origins in Miami, Florida.<ref name="nash hell"/> This was because at the time, the Miami music scene was better known for [[hip hop music]] and [[dance music]] than for country.<ref name="move"/> Many reviewers have considered Malo's role as lead singer and songwriter an integral part of the band's sound. In a review of ''From Hell to Paradise'', Alanna Nash described Malo's singing voice as "a tight, pinched [[vibrato]] that carries all the tension of a high-voltage wire".<ref name="nash hell"/> Writing for AllMusic, John D. Buchanan described ''What a Crying Shame'' as "a grand showcase for the rich, emotive vocals of Raul Malo and the band's eclectic but accessible approach."<ref name="allmusic"/> In a review of ''Trampoline'' for the same site, Thom Owens stated that Malo's voice was the defining characteristic of the band's sound; he wrote that, through his singing and production, Malo was the "driving force behind all of the group's stylistic fusions, their blend of honky tonk with country-rock, classic rock & roll, pop, and Latin."<ref name="owens trampoline">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/trampoline-mw0000009448 | title=''Trampoline'' review |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Thom Owens | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617205158/https://www.allmusic.com/album/trampoline-mw0000009448 | url-status=live }}</ref> Of the songwriting, Owens continued that Malo was "among the most imaginative [[Americana (music)|roots]] songwriting of the '90s."<ref name="owens trampoline"/> [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], a record producer who was also the head of [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) of MCA Nashville at the time of the band's signing, described Malo as "bigger than life" in a way that he compared to [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] lead singer [[Randy Owen]]; Brown also thought that having a "great frontman" was key to a country music band's success.<ref name="move"/>

Music critics have defined the band's musical styles with a wide variety of influences. Brown thought that the success of new bands in the 1990s such as [[Diamond Rio]], combined with the commercial appeal of more rock-influenced country bands such as [[The Kentucky Headhunters]], would lead to The Mavericks' success.<ref name="move"/> Nash wrote that they "constitute country’s coolest ensemble, synthesizing ’50s country and ’60s pop and rock with intelligence, verve, and cultural variety."<ref name="occasions ew"/> John D. Buchanan of AllMusic said of the band that "Fusing traditional country with a rich variety of rock, pop, and Latin influences, the Mavericks became one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups of the early '90s."<ref name="allmusic"/> Rick Bell of the ''North County Times'', in a review of ''Trampoline'', noted that the band's use of [[horn section]]s and [[string section]]s on the album gave it a "fuller sound" that complemented Malo's "velvety baritone".<ref name="rick bell">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/577370379/ | title=Review: The Mavericks, ''Trampoline'' | work=North County Times | date=May 8, 1998 | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | pages=23 | archive-date=February 15, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220215000019/https://www.newspapers.com/image/577370379/ | url-status=live }}</ref>  Mark Deming highlighted Nick Kane's "fine [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] jazz picking" in a review of ''Music for All Occasions''. He also found influences of [[Country-western two-step|two-step]] in the album's "The Writing on the Wall" and [[Tejano music]] through the use of [[accordion]] on "All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down",<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-all-occasions-mw0000645060 | title=''Music for All Occasions'' | work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Mark Deming | archive-date=February 11, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211045334/https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-all-occasions-mw0000645060 | url-status=live }}</ref> while Joel Bernstein of Country Standard Time compared the latter to [[Cajun music]] for the same reason. He also described the band's cover of "Blue Moon" as "[[Roy Orbison]] meets [[Dean Martin]]".<ref name="cst music"/> Deming stated in a review of ''What a Crying Shame'' that "Robert Reynolds and Paul Deakin are a rhythm section who can give these songs the nervy drive of a rock band without betraying the Mavericks' country leanings, and they give the covers of 'All That Heaven Will Allow' and 'O What a Thrill' a taut foundation most contemporary Nashville acts lack."<ref name="deming shame"/>
