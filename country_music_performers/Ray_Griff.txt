His songwriting credits reached over 2500 songs, many of which were recorded by Nashville's top recording artists.<ref name=FYI/>

==Early life and career==
Griff was born in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada <ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=167}}</ref> and raised in [[Winfield, Alberta]].<ref name=FYI>{{cite news |url= http://www.fyimusicnews.ca/articles/2016/03/11/rip-canadian-country-star-ray-griff |last= Delaney |first= Larry |title= RIP: Canadian Country Star Ray Griff |date= March 11, 2016 |publisher=FYI Music News|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref> He began songwriting in the early 1960s and had early cuts by [[Johnny Horton]], [[Jim Reeves]], and others.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Griff moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1964 to pursue his music career full-time. His first records as a singer were released in the late 1960s and Griff had his first hit, "[[Patches (Chairmen of the Board song)|Patches]]", a remake of the [[Clarence Carter]] soul hit in 1970 which peaked at No.&nbsp;26 in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Griff recorded for the small country label Royal American and later moved on to [[Dot Records]] without much success. His stint at [[Capitol Records]] from 1975 to 1979 proved more successful,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> racking up eight more country top 40 hits, the most successful being 1976's "If I Let Her Come In" which peaked at No.&nbsp;11.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Griff's success as a songwriter, however, always overshadowed his recording work with over 700 songs recorded, including the major hits "[[Canadian Pacific (song)|Canadian Pacific]]" for [[George Hamilton IV]], "Who's Gonna Play This Old Piano" for [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and "Baby" for [[Wilma Burgess]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Others who had major hit records with Griff songs include [[Faron Young]], [[Porter Wagoner]] & [[Dolly Parton]], [[Bob Luman]], [[Gene Watson]], and [[Johnny Duncan (country music artist)|Johnny Duncan]].

Griff returned to Canada in the late 1970s and remained active on the country music scene there as an artist, songwriter, and record producer. He lived a quiet life in Calgary, Alberta, occasionally performing at country venues with musicians from the area, most notably the Ranchman's Inn.

==Later years==
In 2008, Griff was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by [[SOCAN]] at the annual SOCAN Awards in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2008-socan-awards|title=2008 SOCAN AWARDS &#124; SOCAN|date=10 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810135616/http://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2008-socan-awards|access-date=7 August 2021|archive-date=2016-08-10}}</ref>

Griff had battled throat cancer in his recent years,<ref name=FYI/> and he died on March 9, 2016, from pneumonia following surgery. He was 75.<ref name="CalgaryHerald²"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodeocountryradio.com/country-news/nde74xav5uw5et1pd6iik1j8gd4ttn|title="Ray Griff, dead at age 75"|website=Rodeocountryradi.com|date=March 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name= CalgaryHerald >{{cite news |url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/music/legendary-calgary-country-gentleman-ray-griff-dies-at-the-age-of-75 |last=Bell|first=Mike |title= Legendary Calgary 'country gentleman' Ray Griff dies at the age of 75|date= March 11, 2016 |newspaper=[[Calgary Herald]]|access-date=June 10, 2016}}</ref>
