== Biography ==
Dykes was born in [[Cleveland, Tennessee|Cleveland]], [[Tennessee]] and grew up in Jacksonville, Florida in a Christian community. His father is referred to as "Bubba Dykes" and he has a brother named Aubrey.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.35"/> He cites June 1965 during his church's "summer revival" as the moment he became a lifelong Christian as an 11-year-old boy, seeing "the lights of salvation and a new purpose and desire for my life and since that day, I've never been the same".<ref name="Dykes2011, p.35">Dykes (2011), p.35</ref> His first guitar was a $30 Sears Roebuck Silvertone acoustic.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.32">Dykes (2011), p.32</ref> Dykes claims a sailor named Barry Lackey was the most important influence in his development as a guitarist. Lackey attended his church one day, and using a thumbpick from his pocket, "completely blew him away" with his "spider picking", playing just like [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Merle Travis]], Doyle's heroes.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.45">Dykes (2011), p.45-7</ref> Lackey was then invited to his home for supper that night and showed him a right-hand picking pattern that "got his fingers working together in the right way, where the thumb played the bass and after-beat rhythm, and the three fingers took care of the rest."<ref name="Dykes2011, p.45"/> He later reunited with Lackey at a Taylor Guitars event in [[Detroit]] in 2002, and said that were it not for him, he would never have become a successful guitarist.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.45"/>

Dykes' early years as a guitarist took him around the world as he toured with [[J. D. Sumner|the Stamps Quartet]] and later with [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Grandpa Jones]]. Dykes has since returned to the Grand Ole Opry for numerous performances. Although a world-renowned guitarist, Dykes frequently plays church venues with small audiences, and some intimate shows that aren't advertised, stating, "I've been blessed with the opportunity to play music for people."<ref name="NAMM"/>

Dykes was a longtime endorser of [[Taylor Guitars]]. According to owner [[Bob Taylor (luthier)|Bob Taylor]], "If I had to pick the artist who most represented the Taylor Guitars brand and who has done the most for us, I would say Doyle Dykes. Doyle has represented Taylor Guitars to more players for more years than anyone."<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Bob|title=Guitar Lessons: A Life's Journey Turning Passion Into Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvahAJJmN60C&pg=PT111|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-93787-7|page=111}}</ref> The Doyle Dykes Signature Model Taylor guitar (“DDSM”) features an amplification system by L.R. Baggs.

On December 23, 2004, Dykes had an operation on a brain tumor in which the surgeon compressed his brain. The operation left him with a temporary loss of balance (meaning he had to learn to walk again) and suffered from extreme headaches and nausea for several years afterwards and ultimately left him deaf in his right ear.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.197">Dykes (2011), p.197-8</ref> He and his wife, Rita, a high school sweetheart, have been married for at least 37 years and have four children, including daughters named Holly, Heidi and Hayley and a son named Caleb, also an accomplished guitarist. He has resided for many years in the [[Nashville]] area and is a close friend of [[Duane Eddy]]. Dykes is an avid collector of old Western movies, including the films of [[John Wayne]], [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]], and [[Steve McQueen]].<ref name="Dykes2011, p.221">Dykes (2011), p.221</ref> In 2011 he released a book ''The Lights of Marfa'', a semi-autobiographical book documenting his encounters with God, with numerous Christian references to events in his own life.
