==Personal life==
On November 5, 1995, Norwood decided to retire because of his addiction to alcohol.

Daron married Suella McCarty on July 5, 2009, which the couple had one son. Norwood also had three daughters from previous marriages.<ref name="obi"/>

Norwood was found dead in his [[Hereford, Texas]], apartment by his landlord on the afternoon of July 22, 2015. The [[Associated Press]] reported he was last seen the previous night by friends.
