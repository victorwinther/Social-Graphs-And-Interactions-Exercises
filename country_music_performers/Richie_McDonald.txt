'''Richard Vance McDonald''' (born February 6, 1962) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. From 1994 until his departure in 2007, he was the lead singer of the group [[Lonestar]], which recorded seven studio albums on [[BNA Records]] during his tenure as lead vocalist. For the first seven years of the band's existence, he alternated with then-bassist [[John Rich]] as vocalist. McDonald became the sole lead vocalist of Lonestar following Rich's departure. McDonald co-wrote several of the band's singles, and sang lead on all but one of them; he would rejoin the band in 2011 before exiting again in 2021 to perform with [[The Frontmen]]. Outside Lonestar, he has charted twice as a guest vocalist on others' songs, in addition to releasing two independent albums and four solo singles.

McDonald announced his departure from Lonestar in 2007, with Cody Collins succeeding him as the group's lead vocalist.

McDonald released his solo debut album ''[[I Turn to You (Richie McDonald album)|I Turn to You]]'' on June 3, 2008. He signed a deal with Stroudavarious Records a month later. His first single for the label, "How Do I Just Stop", was released in November, but did not chart until the week of January 17, 2009, where it debuted at number 53 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart and peaked at 51. A second single, "Hey God", which was originally on his ''I Turn to You'' album and before that on Lonestar's 2006 album ''[[Mountains (Lonestar album)|Mountains]]'', was released on March 3, 2009, but was withdrawn from country radio and replaced with "Six Foot Teddy Bear."

McDonald released ''Slowdown'', his second solo album, in 2010. This album included "How Do I Just Stop", which also peaked at number 51.
