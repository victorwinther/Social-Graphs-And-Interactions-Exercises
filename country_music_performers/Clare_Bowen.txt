==Style and inspiration==
Sonically, Bowen's music fits the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] genre but also contains elements of [[pop music|pop]], [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]] and [[adult contemporary music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.entertainment-focus.com/music-section/ef-country/clare-bowen-clare-bowen-album-review/ |title=Clare Bowen – Clare Bowen album review – Entertainment Focus |publisher=Entertainment-focus.com |date=31 August 2018 |accessdate=8 May 2022}}</ref>

When asked which musicians inspire her music, Bowen stated "[[Dolly Parton]] is probably the biggest one. She tells such wonderful stories and she’s so honest and she’s her. She makes fun of herself. She knows how to be silly and she knows how to be serious. She can lift people up after she’s told them a really heavy story. I think she’s just a really marvellous storyteller. She’s always been a big inspiration to me". She also added that she "loved the way [[Alison Krauss]] sings and the stories she tells" and professes her love of [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]], Australian pop star [[Tina Arena]] and musical theatre legend [[Stephen Sondheim]]. Bowen asserts that [[Buddy Miller]] is her "ultimate music mentor" as he is "the one who taught [her] to use a microphone when [she] first got to Nashville", adding that he and his wife [[Julie Miller|Julie]] "make such beautiful music together".<ref name="entertainment-focus.com"/>
