== History ==
While looking for a band name in the early 2000s, Wyatt discovered the phrase "those poor bastards" in a [[book]], and decided to use it as the name for his band formed with another unidentified member known as The Minister.<ref name=MetalHorizons>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalhorizons.com/2013/04/interview-time-with-lonesome-wyatt.html|title=Interview time with Lonesome Wyatt|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2021}}</ref> In late 2005, his father was alleged to have contacted him for fear that he was a werewolf because he could not remember where he had gotten mud on his shoes. Wyatt has been questioned about the incident in various interviews.<ref name=BlackGate>{{cite web|url=https://www.blackgate.com/2013/08/08/an-interview-with-lonesome-wyatt-of-those-poor-bastards/|title=An Interview With Lonesome Wyatt of Those Poor Bastards|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2021}}</ref><ref name=TheMick>{{cite web|url=http://www.thosepoorbastards.com/the_mick_25_tpb_article.pdf|title=The Mick 25|date=2006|accessdate=September 27, 2021}}</ref> The Minister veils his face in all official band photography, does not perform live and has not revealed his identity.<ref name=NavajoPost2014>{{cite web|url=http://thosepoorbastards.com/pdf/tpb_navajo_post.pdf|title=Halloween Is Here...
