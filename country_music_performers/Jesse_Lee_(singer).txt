Jesse was living in Nashville at the time but traveled back to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where Lee was singing at a fair and was discovered by someone who sent her music to the president of [[Atlantic Records]], who upon hearing her demo, flew her to New York and offered her a record deal.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web | title=Jesse Lee biography | url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lee__jesse/bio.jhtml | work=CMT | access-date=2009-05-26 | archive-date=2009-04-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418193424/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lee__jesse/bio.jhtml | url-status=dead }}</ref> Her debut album is produced by [[Paul Worley]], Mark Bright and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], and it includes her debut single "It's a Girl Thing", which debuted at No.&nbsp;59 on the U.S. country charts dated for June 6, 2009.

"It's a Girl Thing" received a favorable review from Matt Bjorke of Roughstock, who said that the song (which she co-wrote with [[Victoria Banks]] and [[Rachel Proctor]]) had a mainstream sound but showcased Lee's vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/jesse-lee-it-s-a-girl-thing- |title=Jesse Lee — "It's a Girl Thing" |last=Bjorke |first=Matt |date=2009-04-20 |work=Roughstock |access-date=2009-05-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506060358/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/jesse-lee-it-s-a-girl-thing- |archive-date=2009-05-06 }}</ref> Karlie Justus of Engine 145 gave it a thumbs-down rating, saying that the song was cliché and stereotyped, although she also described Lee's vocal performance favorably.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engine145.com/jesse-lee-its-a-girl-thing/ |title=Jesse Lee — "It's a Girl Thing" |last=Justus |first=Karlie |date=2009-05-14 |work=Engine 145 |access-date=2009-05-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104823/http://www.engine145.com/jesse-lee-its-a-girl-thing/ |archive-date=2014-12-18 }}</ref>
