'''Charles Elliott Wicks''' (born June 20, 1979) is an American [[country music]] artist and radio personality. He was one of the participants on the American reality series ''[[Nashville (2007 TV series)|Nashville]]'', which aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] for two episodes before its cancellation in mid-2007. In late 2007, he signed to [[RCA Records]] Nashville as a recording artist, with his debut single "[[Stealing Cinderella]]" being released in September of that year. It served as the lead-off to his debut album ''[[Starting Now (Chuck Wicks album)|Starting Now]]'', which was released in January 2008. "[[All I Ever Wanted (Chuck Wicks song)|All I Ever Wanted]]" and "Man of the House" were released as the album's second and third singles, respectively, and both have charted in the Top 40 as well.

== Personal life ==
Chuck Wicks was born in the community of [[Smyrna, Delaware]],<ref name="gac" /> where he was raised on a potato farm. He is the son of Debbie (Elliott) and John Wicks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/chuck-wicks-and-his-mom-clear-up-misconception-about-radio-reception-of-his-new-song/ |title=Chuck Wicks and His Mom Clear Up Radio Misconception |publisher=Tasteofcountry.com |access-date=November 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.woodallscm.com/tag/chuck-wicks/ |title=Chuck Wicks : Woodall's Campground Management |publisher=Woodallscm.com |access-date=November 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121200634/http://www.woodallscm.com/tag/chuck-wicks/ |archive-date=January 21, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In January 2009, his charity concert in his hometown of [[Smyrna, Delaware|Smyrna]] raised $25,000 for the Smyrna-Clayton [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]].<ref name="Kauss" />

In August 2008, Wicks began dating fellow country singer [[Julianne Hough]], who is a professional dancer and two-time champion on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.<ref name="Finan2008-08-20" /> Wicks and Hough competed as a couple on the eighth season of ''Dancing with the Stars''. Their first performance took place on March 9, 2009, and he was eliminated from the show on April 28. They announced a mutual break-up on November 10, 2009.

In 2018 he announced he is dating Kasi Williams Morstad, the sister of country music singer [[Jason Aldean]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chuck-wicks-is-dating-jason-aldeans-sister-kasi|title=Chuck Wicks is dating Jason Aldean's sister Kasi |website=Foxnews.com}}</ref> The couple got engaged in March 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 8, 2019|title=Chuck Wicks Is Engaged to Girlfriend Kasi Williams: ‘I Will Forever Be Yours’|url=https://people.com/country/chuck-wicks-engaged-kasi-williams/|website=People.com}}</ref> The couple married on July 12, 2019, in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|date=July 14, 2019|title=Chuck Wicks Marries Kasi Williams: All the Details from Their 'Breathtaking' Cabo Wedding|url=https://people.com/country/chuck-wicks-marries-kasi-williams-wedding-photos/|website=People.com}}</ref> On December 4, 2020, they welcomed their first child, a son.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/parents/chuck-wicks-welcomes-son-tucker-elliott-exclusive/|title=Chuck Wicks Welcomes Son Tucker Elliott: 'Kasi and I Are Beside Ourselves'|last1=Juneau|first1=Jen|last2=Michaud|first2=Sarah|last3=Leon|first3=Anya|date=December 5, 2020|accessdate=November 10, 2021|work=People.com}}</ref> Wicks also has three stepdaughters from Morstad's previous marriages.

== Music career ==
Wanting to pursue a career in country music, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] after quitting college two classes short of graduation from [[Florida Southern College]].<ref name="allmusic" /> He then began to hone his songwriting skills, penning more than one hundred songs per year at one point, and one of his songs, "Lead Me On", was recorded by [[Steve Holy]] on his 2006 album ''[[Brand New Girlfriend]]''. Eventually, Wicks caught the attention of [[RCA Records]] executives, who signed him to a recording contract in late 2007. While he was working on his debut album, Wicks was also picked as a cast member of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] reality TV series ''[[Nashville (2007 TV series)|Nashville]]''.<ref name="BuddyTV-profile" /> Due to poor ratings, however, ''Nashville'' was canceled after its second episode.

=== Debut album: ''Starting Now'' (2007–2009) ===

RCA then released Wicks's debut single, "[[Stealing Cinderella]]", which he co-wrote with George Teren and [[Rivers Rutherford]]. He debuted the song at his first [[Grand Ole Opry]] appearance in August 2007.<ref name="Cheeseman2007-08-21" /><ref name="rca" /> Shortly after the song's release, [[University of Tennessee]] football coach [[Phillip Fulmer]] heard it. Fulmer said the song "hit [him] like a ton of bricks," so he contacted Wicks, arranging a private performance at his daughter Courtney's wedding.<ref name="Remz2007-10-01" />

The single produced the biggest debut for any new country artist in all of 2007, with fifty-two of the stations on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} survey adding it in its first official week of airplay.<ref name="Remz2007-10-01" /><ref name="Remz2007-09-17" /> It was also the fastest-climbing debut country single in 2007,<ref name="Remz2007-12-17" /> reaching a peak of number 5 on the country charts in January, and 56 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was included on Wicks' debut album ''[[Starting Now (Chuck Wicks album)|Starting Now]]'', which was released on January 22, 2008<ref name="CMT-bio" /> and peaked at 7 on the [[Top Country Albums]] charts. Wicks co-wrote all but one of the album's tracks. "[[All I Ever Wanted (Chuck Wicks song)|All I Ever Wanted]]" was released in April 2008 as the album's second single, and peaked at 14 by the end of the year. A third single, "Man of the House", followed in January 2009, entering Top 40 in February, and peaked at 27.

=== 2010–present===
On November 10, 2009, Wicks announced that he has started to work on his second album. The album's first single, "Hold That Thought," was released on May 17, 2010, and debuted at number 55 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart for the chart week of June 5, 2010. It was followed by "Old School", which made number 51 on the same chart before Wicks exited the label in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1656508/chuck-wicks-exits-rca-nashville.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023135030/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1656508/chuck-wicks-exits-rca-nashville.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 23, 2012|title=Chuck Wicks Exits RCA Nashville|date=January 24, 2011|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|access-date=January 24, 2011}}</ref> The song remained on the charts after Wicks' departure from the label, and CO5 Music began promoting it in late January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/86277/chuck-wicks-departs-rca-co5-jumps-on-for-promotion|title=Chuck Wicks Departs RCA, CO5 Jumps On For Promotion|date=January 24, 2011|work=All Access|access-date=February 15, 2011}}</ref>

In the midst of preparing to release a new record, Wicks wrote a song titled, "I Don't Do Lonely Well", which got his future brother-in-law [[Jason Aldean]]'s attention and landed him a spot on his then upcoming album ''[[Night Train (Jason Aldean album)|Night Train]]'' in 2012.  Being a fan himself, Wicks was very excited and said that it was a big deal to him that Aldean cut one of his songs to include on his highly anticipated 5th record, which was released on October 6, the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/chuck-wicks-new-music-jason-aldean-i-dont-do-lonely-well/|title=Chuck Wicks Lands Cut on New Jason Aldean Album, Readies His Own New Music|date=July 9, 2012|last=Conaway|first=Alanna|access-date=February 26, 2014}}</ref>
