'''Charles Fitzgerald Robison''' (September 1, 1964 – September 10, 2023)<ref>{{Cite news |last=Andrew |first=Dansby |date=September 10, 2023 |title=Charlie Robison, Texas country singer-songwriter behind 'My Hometown,' dies at 59 |work=Houston Chronicle |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/music/article/charlie-robison-dies-at-59-18358663.php |access-date=September 11, 2023}}</ref> was an American [[country music]] [[singer-songwriter]].

==Career==
After a knee injury at [[Southwest Texas State University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/articlex.asp?xid=723&p=2|title=Charlie Robison steps right up – March 2001|website=Countrystandardtime.com}}</ref> ended a potential football career, Charlie Robison came to Austin, Texas in the late 1980s and had stints in the bands Chaparral, Millionaire Playboys, and Two Hoots and a Holler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/robison_charlie/bio.jhtml|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040216034312/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/robison_charlie/bio.jhtml|archive-date = February 16, 2004|title = Country Music – Music News, New Songs, Videos, Music Shows and Playlists from CMT}}</ref> He went solo with his album "Bandera" in 1996. He subsequently signed with Sony and released "Life of the Party" on Sony's subsidiary Lucky Dog Records. The album gave him three of his biggest hits including "My Hometown." His next release was a live disc called "Unleashed Live," which is credited to Charlie, brother Bruce, and Jack Ingram. He then signed with Columbia Records for "Step Right Up" and another live album.

In 2003, Robison was a judge on the first season of the TV singing competition ''[[Nashville Star]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/nashvillestar/theshow/characterprofiles/robison/index.html |title=USA Network &#124; Nashville Star - Character Profile: Charlie Robison - Judge |website=www.usanetwork.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113050913/http://www.usanetwork.com/series/nashvillestar/theshow/characterprofiles/robison/index.html |archive-date=13 November 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Unhappy with the expectations and limitations of being a Nashville country artist, he moved to a smaller independent label, Dualtone, for ''Good Times'' in 2004, followed by extensive touring and newfound control over his career. Accordingly, his sound began to evolve away from mainstream/Nashville country and toward more [[Southern rock|Southern]] and [[hard rock]] influences.

Five years after the release of "Good Times," Robison released ''Beautiful Day'' on June 23, 2009, on Dualtone. This was the first album he self-produced. Both albums featured several songs written by Nashville singer-songwriter Keith Gattis.

His song "Good Times" was featured in the credits of [[HBO]]'s original series ''[[True Blood]]'' in the first season's third episode.

In 2009, he embarked on an [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] tour with stops in Little Rock, Nashville, Atlanta, Raleigh, New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Iowa City, and Memphis to promote ''Beautiful Day''. Since then he has played primarily in Texas, with occasional shows in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado.

Robison was known for playing [[classic rock]] covers during his live shows.

His live band included Mark Tokach (lead guitar), Abe Combest (drums), Zeke Benenate (bass) J.C. Burt (steel guitar) and Chris Valdez (road manager and additional guitar). Prior to Beautiful Day, his band was known as The Enablers, and included Keith Robinson (drums), Scott Esbeck (bass) and Travis Woodard (drums). Other notable members have included Kim Deschamps (pedal & lap steel, mandolin and guitar from 2000–2009), Kevin Carroll (guitar), Jason Bryl (bass), Chris Grady (bass), Louis Landry (keyboards and accordion), and Kris Brown (bass). His recordings have also featured special guests Lloyd Maines (who produced "Step Right Up" and "Good Times"), Rich Brotherton, Charlie Sexton, and Natalie Maines (duet on "The Wedding Song" and harmony vocals on "El Cerrito Place").

In September 2014, Robison opened Alamo Icehouse in San Antonio, Texas, with former Major League Baseball player [[Brooks Kieschnick]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lucio |first=Valentino |date=September 13, 2014 |title=Downtown ice house & BBQ joint opens |url=https://blog.mysanantonio.com/food/2014/09/downtown-ice-house-bbq-joint-opens/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412225612/https://blog.mysanantonio.com/food/2014/09/downtown-ice-house-bbq-joint-opens/ |archive-date=April 12, 2021 |website=Blog.mysanantonio.com}}</ref>

On September 24, 2018, Robison announced that due to complications from surgery, he was permanently unable to sing, and that he was officially retiring from stage and studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/charlie-robison-retirement-lost-voice-surgery/|title=Untitled|website=tasteofcountry.com|date=September 24, 2018}}</ref> Robison resumed his music career in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trigger |date=2022-09-28 |title=Texas Country Legend Charlie Robison is Exploring a Comeback |url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/texas-country-legend-charlie-robison-is-exploring-a-comeback/ |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=Saving Country Music |language=en-US}}</ref> He returned to Billy Bob's as part of his first tour since 2018, playing at the same venue where he first played in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Charlie Robison |url=https://billybobstexas.com/events/charlie-robison |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230604032706/https://billybobstexas.com/events/charlie-robison |archive-date=June 4, 2023 |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=Billy Bob's Texas |language=en}}</ref>
