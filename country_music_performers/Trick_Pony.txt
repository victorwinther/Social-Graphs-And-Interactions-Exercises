'''Trick Pony''' was an American [[country music]] group, formed in 1999 by [[Heidi Newfield]] (lead vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica), Keith Burns (lead guitar, vocals), and Ira Dean (bass guitar, vocals). They recorded three [[studio album]]s: ''[[Trick Pony (album)|Trick Pony]]'', ''[[On a Mission (Trick Pony album)|On a Mission]]'', and ''[[R.I.D.E.]]'', released in 2001, 2002, and 2005. These albums produced eight [[single (music)|singles]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including four Top 20 hits: "[[Pour Me (Trick Pony song)|Pour Me]]", "[[On a Night like This (Trick Pony song)|On a Night like This]]", "[[Just What I Do]]", and "On a Mission".

In 2006, Newfield departed for a solo career and Aubrey Collins replaced her as lead vocalist. The group disbanded after Collins and Dean left in 2007 and 2008. Newfield released a solo debut album, ''[[What Am I Waiting For]]'', in 2008 on [[Curb Records]], while Burns joined singer Michelle Poe to form a duo called [[Burns & Poe]]. Burns, Dean, and Newfield reformed the group in late 2013, although Dean left again in 2014. The revived lineup released one more album, ''Pony Up'', via Permian Records in 2016.

==History==
Trick Pony was formed in 1996 by guitarist Keith Burns and bass guitarist Ira Dean. Both musicians had experience as backing musicians for other country music acts: Burns had previously worked with [[Joe Diffie]], and Dean with [[Tanya Tucker]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p458006|pure_url=yes}} |title=Trick Pony biography |accessdate=2007-12-18 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Keith and Ira decided to form a group composed of two men and a woman. Completing the lineup was lead singer [[Heidi Newfield]], a friend of Burns's wife.<ref name="allmusic"/> The trio began touring throughout the [[Southern United States]] and performed regularly at 8 Seconds Saloon in Indianapolis, Indiana.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===Musical career===
[[File:Trick Pony2.jpg|thumb|left|Ira Dean, Heidi Newfield and Keith Burns signing autographs at the [[CMA Music Festival]] in 2006]]
By 2000, Trick Pony was signed to a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The trio released its [[Trick Pony (album)|self-titled]] debut album that year. Serving as its lead-off single was "[[Pour Me (Trick Pony song)|Pour Me]]" which reached #12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music chart.<ref name="whitburn"/> The album's next two singles were "[[On a Night like This (Trick Pony song)|On a Night like This]]" and "[[Just What I Do]]", which reached #4 and #13 on the country chart.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=427|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/bltrickponyrev.htm |title=CD review: ''Trick Pony'' - Trick Pony |accessdate=21 August 2008 |last=Downs |first=Jolene |work=[[About.com]]}}</ref> In 2001, the trio also received the Artist of the Year award from the [[Country Music Association]].<ref name="gacbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_az_trick_pony/article/0,,GAC_27020_4736021,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123163957/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_az_trick_pony/article/0,,GAC_27020_4736021,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-23 |title=Trick Pony biography |accessdate=2007-12-18 |work=Great American Country }}</ref>

''[[On a Mission (Trick Pony album)|On a Mission]]'' was the title of Trick Pony's second album. Although its [[David Lee Murphy]]-penned title track reached Top 20 on the country chart, the second single (2003's "A Boy Like You") failed to enter Top 40,<ref name="whitburn"/> and the group was dropped from Warner Bros.' roster shortly afterward.

In 2004, Trick Pony was signed to its second record deal, this time with [[Curb Records|Asylum-Curb Records]].<ref name="gacbio"/> The group's sixth single overall, entitled "The Bride", was issued that year, serving as the lead-off to their third studio album, ''[[R.I.D.E.]]'', whose title is an abbreviation for "Rebellious Individuals Delivering Entertainment".<ref name="about">{{cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/news/a/trickpony_cma.htm |title=Trick Pony Rides A Bumpy Road To Maturity |accessdate=2007-12-18 |last=Caviness |first=Crystal |work=About.com}}</ref> The second single from ''R.I.D.E.'' was a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s "[[It's a Heartache]]".
