==Biography==
[[File:The Lost Gonzo Band 1977.JPG|thumb|Nunn (far right) with The Lost Gonzo Band, 1977]]
Nunn was born in [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]] and moved to [[Brownfield, Texas]] as a sixth grader.<ref name="Lubbock">"Gary P. Nunn: West Texas Walk of Fame Member Returns to The Blue Light Live", Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, May 14, 2010.</ref> He began his musical career as a seventh grader in a garage band in Brownfield, Texas, where he was an honor student and all-around athlete. Upon graduation from high school, he attended [[Texas Tech University]] and [[South Plains College]], while he also played with a [[Levelland, Texas]] rock band [[The Sparkles]] during the 1960s. In addition to the Sparkles, Nunn played in such bands as the Shucks with former Cricket [[J.I. Allison]], and the Night Spots with Don Caldwell. "I always had fun in Lubbock," said Nunn, "and I always enjoy going back there."<ref name="Lubbock" />

In 1968, he transferred to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where he was a pharmacy major.<ref name="DMN">"Songs of Sheer Nunnsense: Gary P. Nunn Invites Us To Go Dancing", Dallas Morning News, December 4, 1997.</ref> Nunn was there at the start of the "cosmic cowboy" movement with one of Austin's favorite bands, The Lavender Hill Express, with the late [[Rusty Wier]].<ref>"Off the Record Music News", Austin Chronicle, October 16, 2009</ref> Nunn immersed himself further in the local music scene, playing bass for [[Michael Martin Murphey]], the late [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and [[Willie Nelson]]. From there he was a pianist for the [[Lost Gonzo Band]] that backed Walker and Murphey both on stage and in the studio.
Jerry Jeff Walker and the Lost Gonzo Band (including Nunn) released six albums through [[MCA Records]] over the course of four years.<ref>"All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music" by Hal Leonard, Backbeat Books, 2003</ref>
The Lost Gonzo Band parted ways with Walker in 1977, after which they produced three albums for MCA and [[Capitol Records]], finally disbanding in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbec.com/index.php/component/content/article/204-garypnunnbio |title=Biography: Gary P.

Nunn", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 12, 2014.</ref>

In 1985, Nunn moved to a family farm in Oklahoma, running an 800-acre cattle ranch at the same time as his musical career. He established the Terlingua North Chili Cook-Off and Music Festival there, where now-popular acts like [[Pat Green]] and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] played early in their careers. "It seems every time we had a young and upcoming band up there, it was like they hit a diving board and just sprung into the air," Nunn notes. And within today's thriving Texas and [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] scene, he's a revered elder statesman to countless performers and songwriters who teethed and grew up on his music. "They’ve let me know I inspired them and showed them how it could be done."<ref name="floores">{{Cite web|url=http://www.liveatfloores.com/event/345355/|website=John T.

Nunn's songs have been recorded by various nationally known country artists, including [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Michael Martin Murphey|Michael Murphey]], [[Tracy Nelson (singer)|Tracy Nelson]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Rosanne Cash]], and [[Willie Nelson]] among others. With a continuing array of successful solo albums and an army of fans, Nunn has made a permanent mark on the Texas/Southwestern/Country/Folk music scene.

Along with being a touring performer, Nunn has appeared on programs such as [[Nashville Now]], [[The Nashville Network]]'s Texas Connection, music videos and special appearances on TNN, [[Austin City Limits]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball games (singing the national anthem), among other appearances.<ref name="musicaw">http://www.texasmusicawards.org/images/Gary%20P%20Bio.doc {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref>
