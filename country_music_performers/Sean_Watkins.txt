==Career==

===Nickel Creek===
Sean Watkins began his tenure with Nickel Creek playing mandolin, but later switched to guitar. The band has released six albums and a CD composed of their hits (called ''Reasons Why: The Very Best'') and won a [[Grammy]] for ''[[This Side]]'' – a coveted trophy that Watkins reportedly put on top of his toilet at home. Explaining the somewhat odd situation, Watkins said that "it seems like a humble place. I didn't want to put it out in plain view of my house. I didn't feel like displaying it right when you walk in. It's a nice crown for the porcelain."<ref name="toiletgrammy">[http://www.lawrence.com/news/2003/nov/06/millionselling_trio/ Million-selling trio Nickel Creek gives bluegrass a facelift]</ref> In addition to playing with Nickel Creek, Watkins has released multiple solo albums.

As a solo musician, his early material was contemporary bluegrass, but he has since incorporated other influences into his music (especially indie rock.) Watkins' solo music career seems to reflect Nickel Creek's: turning from traditional [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] songs to indie rock with bluegrass instrumentation. He is the oldest member of [[Nickel Creek]]. Sean qualified for the National Flatpicking Championship in 1993 at age 16.

{{blockquote|"My first instrument was the piano when I was six", Sean recalled. "I took classic instruction for seven years, but three years into that I discovered [[bluegrass music]], through my piano teacher's son, who had a bluegrass band that played every Saturday night at a [[pizza]] place in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]]. I really got into it, and when Sara and I met [[Chris Thile|Chris]] [Thile], we started playing with him on Saturday nights too."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}}}

His sister [[Sara Watkins]], also a member of [[Nickel Creek]], plays violin and sings background vocals on the two latest of his three solo albums. In 2004, [[Nickel Creek]] participated in a project dubbed ''Mutual Admiration Society'', a collaboration with former [[Toad The Wet Sprocket]] singer [[Glen Phillips (singer)|Glen Phillips]]. Sean and [[Sara Watkins|Sara]] are also part of the 2007 soundtrack for the psychological thriller ''[[Bug (2007 film)|Bug]]'' with the track "No Way to Live".

===Current projects===
In 2006, Sean and [[Switchfoot]] frontman [[Jon Foreman]] started a collaborating duo called The Real SeanJon.<ref name="news">[http://www.nickelcreek.com/ Nickel Creek Official Website]</ref><ref name="longblog">Watkins, Sean. "a very long blog about what i'm up to". ''MySpace''. January 5, 2008. Retrieved January 27, 2007.</ref> In March 2008, the duo announced that they had changed their band name to [[Fiction Family]]. In a spring 2008 interview, Jon Foreman said that the album would have a summer 2008 release and the duo was considering having the album be distributed by [[Starbucks]].<ref>[http://mammothpress.com/index.php?area=readinterview&pid=165 "Switchfoot – 02.24.08"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221220810/http://mammothpress.com/index.php?area=readinterview&pid=165|date=December 21, 2008}}. ''[[Mammoth Press]]''.  March 19, 2008. Retrieved March 20, 2008.</ref> However, a September 2008 press release by Nickel Creek confirmed that the album, ''Fiction Family'', is to be released on January 20, 2009, on [[ATO Records]].<ref>[http://clicks1.musictoday.com/cts/click?q=1;104298;Bc7UKcXiQIQEVKfe%2BXQFkA%3D%3D "update on everything Nickel Creek"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126032853/http://clicks1.musictoday.com/cts/click?q=1 |date=January 26, 2009 }}. nickelcreek.com.

In January 2008, it was reported by [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] that a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] octet tentatively named [[The Scrolls]] had formed, now known officially as [[Works Progress Administration (musical group)|Works Progress Administration]] (W.P.A.). The octet is composed of Watkins, his sister Sara Watkins (fiddle), [[Glen Phillips (singer)|Glen Phillips]] (guitar, vocals), [[Benmont Tench]] (piano), Luke Bulla (fiddle), [[Greg Leisz]] (various), [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]] (drums), and [[Davey Faragher]] (bass). The group released their self-titled debut album on August 28, 2009. As the group continued, the lead singer-songwriters Watkins (Sean), Phillips, and Bulla were considered the core group and were supported by others when their projects made it possible. Bulla is no longer considered part of the group and as of summer 2011, their most recent lineup was Watkins and Phillips supported by Jerry Roe on drums and Sebastian Steinberg on bass guitar.

Sean and sister Sara play regularly at the [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]] nightclub in Los Angeles as "The [[Watkins Family Hour]]". Keyboardist [[Benmont Tench]] (of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) and bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] (formerly of Soul Coughing) are regular participants and other guest musicians from the Largo family generally show up as well, including [[Jon Brion]], [[Fiona Apple]], Don Heffington, [[Greg Leisz]], and former Nickel Creek bandmate [[Chris Thile]] when he is in town. The irregular collaboration lead to a 2015 album and tour under the same name.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCue|first1=Lori|title=Sean and Sara Watkins are taking their Watkins Family Hour on the road, and bringing famous friends|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/09/03/sean-and-sara-watkins-are-taking-their-watkins-family-hour-on-the-road-and-bringing-famous-friends/|accessdate=14 July 2016|newspaper=Washington Post|date=3 September 2015}}</ref>

Sean has also frequently supported his sister Sara on guitar and vocals for her solo dates since the release of her debut album in April 2009.

In addition, Watkins plans to release what he calls "15 minutes of noise" as a digital download on his website. He said that the final product was "very strange",<ref name="longblog"/> and that there would "be some cool art to go with it".<ref>Watkins, Sean. "about the "15 minutes of noise" and my string quartet.". ''MySpace''. January 5, 2008. Retrieved January 27, 2007.</ref>

In October 2013, Sean announced that he had completed a record entitled ''All I Do Is Lie'', which was released in June 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seanwatkins.com/2013/10/04/new-solo-record-all-i-do-is-lie-completed-stay-tuned-for-release-info/ |title=New solo record "All I do is Lie" completed.
