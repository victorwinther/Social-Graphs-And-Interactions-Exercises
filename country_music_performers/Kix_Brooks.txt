==Early life==
Brooks grew up in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]]. He has a sister, a half-sister, and a half-brother; his father also adopted a son of his third wife. After graduating from the former [[St. Andrew's-Sewanee School|Sewanee Military Academy]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] school in [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]], [[Tennessee]], Brooks attended [[Louisiana Tech University]] in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] as a [[theatre arts]] major. He moved to [[Alaska]] to work with his father on an oil [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] for one summer, then returned to Louisiana Tech to finish his education. After graduating, he moved to [[Maine]] to write advertising for a company owned by his sister and brother-in-law.

==Musical career==

Brooks' father urged him to pursue his desire to become a musician, and he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, in the early 1980s.  His then-girlfriend (now wife Barbara, with whom he has a son and daughter) followed shortly thereafter.  He worked for Tree Publishing as a staff songwriter.  He recorded his first solo single, "Baby, When Your Heart Breaks Down", for Avion in 1983, but returned to songwriting after it only reached number 73 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Brooks and Dan Tyler co-wrote "[[Modern Day Romance]]", released by [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] in June 1985; it became the band's second No. 1 hit on the country chart.
