==Biography==
Drew Baldridge was born in [[Patoka, Illinois]] on July 29, 1991. He began performing in local talent contests as a teenager, and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] at age 18 to pursue a career in country music. Baldridge released a pair of extended plays digitally between 2014 and 2015. Later on, he released the single "Dance with Ya", which was officially sent to radio and became his first chart entry on [[Country Airplay]]. A full studio album, ''Dirt on Us'', came by year's end.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/drew-baldridge-mn0003381264/biography|title=Drew Baldridge biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=March 10, 2018}}</ref> In promotion of the album, Baldridge toured with [[Lee Brice]] and [[Cole Swindell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2016/05/19/whos-new-drew-baldridge/|title=Who's New: Drew Baldridge|work=Nash Country Daily|date=May 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}</ref>

Baldridge announced a new single, "Guns & Roses", at the end of 2017. The song is intended to be the lead single to his second studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/drew-baldridge-on-new-song-guns-roses-bringing-the-funk-w511531|title=Rising Songwriter Drew Baldridge on New Song 'Guns & Roses,' Bringing the Funk|work=Rolling Stone Country|date=November 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, Baldridge's label Cold River closed. As a result, he founded his own label called Lyric Ridge in 2020. His first Lyric Ridge release, "[[She's Somebody's Daughter]]", was a song he had originally cut on Cold River. Between 2023 and 2024, the song became a viral hit, and went on to become Baldridge's first top-40 hit on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://people.com/country/drew-baldridge-debuts-new-music-video-featuring-wedding-footage/ | title=Drew Baldridge Debuts 'She's Somebody's Daughter' Music Video — Featuring His Wedding Footage! | publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]] | date=May 18, 2021 | accessdate=July 4, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://countrynow.com/drew-baldridge-reflects-on-independent-journey-to-radio-success-with-shes-somebodys-daughter-exclusive/ | title=Drew Baldridge Reflects On Independent Journey To Radio Success With 'She's Somebody's Daughter' [Exclusive] | publisher=Country Now | date=June 20, 2024 | accessdate=July 4, 2024}}</ref>
