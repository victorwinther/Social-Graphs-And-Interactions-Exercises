==Musical career==
In 2000, Heatherly was signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]] as a recording artist. His debut single was a [[cover version]] of [[The Statler Brothers]]' 1965 debut single "[[Flowers on the Wall]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1476343/20030808/heatherly_eric.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706210304/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1476343/20030808/heatherly_eric.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 6, 2007 |title="Flowers on the Wall" Blooms Again |accessdate=2007-12-14 |date=2000-02-03 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> Heatherly's rendition was a Top Ten hit on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart, peaking at #6 in mid-2000.

The song served as the first single from his debut album. Entitled ''[[Swimming in Champagne]]'', the album was co-produced by [[Keith Stegall]]. Due to a restructuring of Mercury Nashville's parent company, ''Swimming in Champagne'' received minimal promotion;<ref name="allmusic"/> its second and third singles peaked at #46 and at #32 on the chart. Heatherly had also recorded a second album for Mercury, but it was not released, and Heatherly was dropped from the label by 2002.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1452243/20020211/heatherly_eric.jhtml |title=Heatherly Parts With Mercury |accessdate=2007-12-14 |date=2002-04-11 |work=CMT.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

A month after parting ways with Mercury, Heatherly signed to [[DreamWorks Records]]' Nashville division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1452857/20020312/heatherly_eric.jhtml |title=Heatherly Signs With DreamWorks |accessdate=2007-12-14 |date=2002-03-12 |work=CMT.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> His third album, to be titled ''Sometimes It's Just Your Time'', was to have been released in late 2002. Its lead-off single ("The Last Man Committed") entered the country music chart; although promotional advance copies of the album, ''Sometimes It's Just Your Time'', had been issued, it was ultimately unreleased as well.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Three years after his departure from DreamWorks's roster, he founded a personal label named NashVegas Records, with [[Koch Records]] serving as distributor.<ref name="allmusic"/> His fourth album overall (but only the second to be released), ''[[The Lower East Side of Life]]'', was issued in 2005, though no singles were released from it.<ref name="cw">{{cite journal|last=Hollabaugh|first=Lorie|date=2009-05-11|title=In Bloom Once Again|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=16|issue=13|pages=50}}</ref>

After ''The Lower East Side of Life'', Heatherly continued to tour, in addition to manufacturing custom-made guitar straps. Through the help of songwriter and producer Carson Chamberlain, Heatherly recorded a song called "Unforgettable", which appeared in an episode of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.<ref name="cw"/> He has also recorded another album, ''2 High 2 Cry'', released in 2009.<ref name="cw"/> A second self-released album, ''Painkillers'', followed in 2010.
