==Early life==
Jason Aldine Williams was born in [[Macon, Georgia]],<ref name="whitburn" /><ref name="allmusic" /> on February 28, 1977. His parents separated when he was three. He was raised by his mother in Macon, and during the summer he spent time with his father in [[Homestead, Florida]]. He attended [[Windsor Academy]], a private Christian school in [[Bibb County, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jason Aldean |url=https://waknights.com/our_team/jason-aldean/ |access-date=July 26, 2023 |website=Windsor Academy Knights}}</ref> Before his father went to his work, Aldean would map out guitar chords on notebook paper to show his son where to place his fingers to play the chords and Jason would sit and practice all day while his father was at work. When his father got home, he got out his own guitar and they played together. Soon he could play a song after hearing it only a few times. His early favorites included [[George Strait]]'s "[[The Cowboy Rides Away (song)|The Cowboy Rides Away]]", [[Hank Williams Jr.]]'s "The Blues Man", and [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]'s "[[My Home's in Alabama (song)|My Home's in Alabama]]".

Both of his parents encouraged young Aldean as he progressed musically. From age 14, after watching the country-music awards on television, he wanted to perform on stage. With his mother's help, he performed at the local VFW hall in Macon. He sang [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s song "[[Seminole Wind (song)|Seminole Wind]]" and [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s "[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence song)|Sticks and Stones]]". He then began performing at area talent contests and local fairs. At 15, he joined the "house band" at Georgia nightspot Nashville South.

In order to stand out, Aldean changed the spelling of his middle name, Aldine, to come up with the name Aldean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wycd.cbslocal.com/2015/01/20/10-country-stars-that-use-stage-names|title=10 Country Stars That Use Stage Names|date=January 20, 2015|access-date=June 28, 2015|archive-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630221330/http://wycd.cbslocal.com/2015/01/20/10-country-stars-that-use-stage-names/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Career==
===1998–2004: Career beginnings===
After high school, with his father's help, Aldean and his band performed at clubs and festivals around the Southeast. With Justin Weaver (one of the band's members), Aldean began writing and recording original songs. In 1998, he performed songs from his first album at a showcase staged by [[Atlanta]] nightclub The Buckboard. He was approached by [[Michael Knox (record producer)|Michael Knox]], then of the [[Warner Chappell Music|Warner-Chappell]] song-publishing company.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p730273/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jason Aldean Biography |access-date=December 23, 2010 |last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=[[AllMusic|Allmusic]]}}</ref> After signing with Warner-Chappell, Aldean moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on November 1, 1998, at the age of 21.

Aldean was offered a recording contract but was subsequently dropped. He signed with another label but again was dropped in 2000 after his label postponed his recording sessions repeatedly. Various showcases failed to bring him a contract. The last straw was an attempt at the Wildhorse Saloon where the promised label talent scouts never showed up. Frustrated and discouraged with his struggling career, Aldean gave himself six months before planning to leave Nashville and return home to Georgia. Then five weeks later, he was offered a deal from [[BBR Music Group|Broken Bow Records]] in Nashville. Shortly after the release of [[Jason Aldean (album)|his self-titled debut album]], Aldean picked up his new (and current) agent Kevin Neal. While recording ''[[Relentless (Jason Aldean album)|Relentless]]'', Aldean moved to Clarence Spalding and Spalding Entertainment for management.

===2005–2008: ''Jason Aldean'' and ''Relentless''===

The song earned a 2006 ACM nomination for Song of the Year and Video of the Year. Aldean earned the title "Top New Male Vocalist" at the 2006 [[Academy of Country Music Awards|ACM Awards]]. Over 1,000,000 copies of the album were sold in the United States and it was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]] in 2007.

But the real highlight for him was that he was working with Randy Owen. "I am a big fan of [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] so I got a chance to work with [[Randy Owen]] on this album (it didn't make the album but it eventually made a bonus track). It was really cool. Alabama were like '[[The Beatles]]' for me so working with him was definitely one of the highlights," he said "I mean, both of those guys were really cool moments, but if I had to pick one highlight, it would be working with Randy [Owen] this year."<ref name="shavemagazine">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/091101 |title=Interview With Jason Aldean |magazine=Shave Magazine |first=Ziyah |last=Karmali |access-date=November 30, 2009 |date=November 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213085509/http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/091101 |archive-date=December 13, 2010}}</ref> A live DVD titled ''[[Wide Open Live & More]]'' was released on August 25, 2009.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} At the 2010 CMT Music Awards, Aldean picked up 3 nominations in Video of the Year and Male Video of the Year for "The Truth", as well as Collaborative Video of the Year and CMT Performance of the Year for his performance of "Heaven" with Bryan Adams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cmt.com/2010-04-05/jason-aldean-lady-antebellum-sugarland-lead-2010-cmt-music-awards-nominees/#comment-137607 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407001017/http://blog.cmt.com/2010-04-05/jason-aldean-lady-antebellum-sugarland-lead-2010-cmt-music-awards-nominees/#comment-137607 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 7, 2010 |title=Jason Aldean, Lady Antebellum, Sugarland Lead 2010 CMT Music Awards Nominees |publisher=[[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] |date=April 5, 2010 |access-date=February 3, 2011}}</ref>
