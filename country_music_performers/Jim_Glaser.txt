==Biography==
The brother of country singers Chuck and [[Tompall Glaser]], he performed as both a solo artist and alongside his two brothers in the group [[Tompall and the Glaser Brothers]]. His early career as a backup vocalist included a long stint with singer/songwriter [[Marty Robbins]].  Shortly before beginning his solo recording career he had two major hits as songwriter in 1964, the top 5 "What Does it Take" which was recorded by [[Skeeter Davis]] and the top 40 "Thanks a Lot for Tryin' Anyway" recorded by [[Liz Anderson]] and later covered in albums by [[Jan Howard]] and [[Connie Smith]]. His biggest songwriting success was "[[Woman, Woman]]" a number 4 pop hit recorded by [[Gary Puckett & The Union Gap]] in 1967, and charting again for Glaser himself in 1975.

As a solo artist, Jim Glaser recorded four studio albums, and charted several singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the Number One hit "[[You're Gettin' to Me Again]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> Out of his three brothers, he was the only one to have a Number One hit. He was selected by the [[Academy of Country Music]] as [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Best New Male Vocalist]] in 1984. In 1979 he recorded the first version of the song "Who Were You Thinkin' Of," which he co-wrote with [[Cathie Pelletier]] and Paul Gauvin; it was later recorded by [[The Texas Tornados]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|website=SecondHandSongs|url=https://secondhandsongs.com/work/127192/all|title=Who Were You Thinkin' Of|accessdate=July 11, 2022}}</ref>
