== Career ==

Taylor's first big hit was "[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]", which, though first recorded in 1965 by [[Jordan Christopher]] and [[The Wild Ones (band)|the Wild Ones]], became famous as both a hit single by [[the Troggs]] in 1966 and a [[concert|live performance]] by [[Jimi Hendrix]] in 1967, and was later covered by [[the Runaways]], the [[Muppets]], and [[X (American band)|X]].{{citation needed|date=November 2023}} "[[Angel of the Morning]]" was first recorded by [[Evie Sands]] in 1967, before becoming a hit for [[Merrilee Rush]] and also [[P. P. Arnold]] in 1968, then a million-selling single in 1981 for country-pop singer [[Juice Newton]]; later a rendition from [[Chrissie Hynde]] was released.

Other notable pop and country songs written by Taylor include "He Sits at Your Table" ([[Willie Nelson]]), "[[I Can't Let Go]]" ([[Evie Sands]], [[the Hollies]], [[Linda Ronstadt]]), "The Baby" ([[the Hollies]]), "Worry" ([[Johnny Tillotson]]), "Make Me Belong to You" ([[Barbara Lewis]]), "I Can Make It With You" ([[the Pozo Seco Singers]], [[Jackie DeShannon]]), "[[Any Way That You Want Me]]" (the Troggs, [[Evie Sands]], Melanie, [[American Breed]], Juice Newton, [[ Mary Mason]], [[Lita Ford]], [[Liverpool Five]]), "[[On My Word]]" ([[Cliff Richard]]), "Step Out of Your Mind" ([[The American Breed]]), "Country Girl City Man" ([[Billy Vera]] and [[Judy Clay]]), "I'll Hold Out My Hand", "Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)" ([[Lorraine Ellison]], [[Janis Joplin]]), "Julie" ([[Bobby Fuller]] Four, [[Marshall Crenshaw]]), and "Lonely Is As Lonely Does" ([[the Fleetwoods]]).{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

[[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] used "[[Angel of the Morning]]" as the basis for his hit "[[Angel (Shaggy song)|Angel]]" in 2001.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-shaggy-194216/|title=Q&A: Shaggy|last=Udovitch|first=Mim|date=15 February 2001|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329112113/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-shaggy-194216/|archive-date=29 March 2019}}</ref>

In 2009, [[Ace Records (UK)|Ace Records]] released a compilation CD of some of Taylor's compositions as recorded by other artists (''Wild Thing: The Songs of Chip Taylor'').{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

=== His own recordings ===
[[File:Chip Taylor's Last Chance, 1973.png|thumb|Chip Taylor, 1973]]
Taylor's first releases were on the [[King Records (United States)|King]] label and their subsidiary [[De Luxe Records|DeLuxe]]. In 1958, he and the Town Three released two 45s on DeLuxe, numbers 6176 "Midnight Blues" and 6180 "I Want a Lover". In 1959, he recorded for King as Wes Voight on 5211 "I'm Movin' In", and his final recording as Wes Voight on King 5231 "I'm Ready to Go Steady" and "The Wind and the Cold Black Night". The two King 45s were released in both mono and stereo, making them some of the first stereo singles available. Taylor has released recordings on [[Warner Bros.]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and [[Capitol Records|Capitol]].  His first chart single was his recording (as Chip Taylor) of "Here I Am" in 1962 on Warner Bros. Records.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trainwreckrecords.com/assets/i/press_kits/Chip_Taylor_Fact_File.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515024711/http://trainwreckrecords.com/assets/i/press_kits/Chip_Taylor_Fact_File.pdf |archive-date=May 15, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He also had a top 40 hit in Australia in 1963 with "Sandy Sandy" with the Town and Country Brothers, a later iteration of Wes Voight and the Town Three, with Ted Daryll (who wrote the song) and Greg Richards, writers of "[[She Cried]]" by [[Jay and the Americans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poparchivesblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/only-in-oz-14-town-country-brothers.html|title=The Blog: Only in Oz (14) The Town & Country Brothers – Sandy, Sandy|first=Lyn|last=Nuttall|publisher=PopArchives|date=July 17, 2009|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/share/ted_daryll_t&c_brothers.pdf|title=Letter to Lyn Nuttall|first=Ted|last=Daryll|publisher=PopArchives|year=2009|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>

=== Performing and recording in the 1990s and the 21st century ===
Taylor restarted his performing and recording career in 1993.

At the 2001 [[SXSW|South by Southwest Music Conference]] in [[Austin, Texas]], Taylor met singer and violinist [[Carrie Rodriguez]], with whom he performed and recorded [[Americana (music)|Americana]] music for several years. The duo recorded ''Let's Leave This Town'' in 2002. They released ''The Trouble With Humans'' the following year and the critically acclaimed ''Red Dog Tracks'' in 2005. Each has since released successful solo albums. Taylor's double-CD ''Unglorious Hallelujah/Red Red Rose'', his first solo album in five years, was quickly hailed as "a future classic" by Sonic Magazine, whose reviewer declared: "This is the best we've heard from Chip Taylor so far."  Rodriguez's solo album, ''Seven Angels on a Bicycle'', was released in August 2006. In late 2006 and early 2007, Rodriguez toured on her own but continued to perform with Taylor from time to time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121293929|title=Chip Taylor On Mountain Stage|website=Npr.org|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref> Taylor has done a series of shows{{when|date=November 2023}} with guitarist [[John Platania]] and the young singer/fiddler [[Kendel Carson]], and he produced both their 2007 albums.

During the 21st century through 2020, Taylor has continued to perform with his band The New Ukrainians (John Platania on electric guitar, Björn Petterson on bass, and a revolving cast of other musicians). Each concert almost always includes both "Wild Thing" and "Angel in the Morning".<ref name=CTaylor_TourDates>{{cite web| last=Taylor| first=Chip| title=Tour Dates| url=https://www.trainwreckrecords.com/tour-dates.html| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref><ref name=CTaylor_RoadJournal>{{cite web| last=Taylor| first=Chip| title=Chip Taylor's Road Journal| url=https://www.trainwreckrecords.com/road-journal| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref><ref name=ChipTaylor_Dad&theMonkey>{{cite web| publisher=Train Wreck Records| title=Chip Taylor – Dad & The Monkey| date=October 2020| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U1dhxEmsN4| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref>

Taylor's album ''Yonkers, NY'' was a 2011 nominee for a [[Grammy Award]] for best recording package, but lost to ''Brothers'' by [[the Black Keys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=5061 |title=Black Keys package takes Grammy over Chip Taylor |website=Countrystandardtime.com |date=October 23, 2007 |access-date=November 7, 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Paal Flaata]] released an album of only Chip Taylor songs, ''Wait By the Fire – Songs of Chip Taylor''.

===Rainy Day Records===

In 1967, Taylor, along with Al Gorgoni, formed Rainy Day Records, which was distributed by [[Jubilee Records]].  The label released the single "[[Night Owl (James Taylor song)|Night Owl]]" by the Flying Machine, a group that included [[James Taylor]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finkle |first1=Dave |title=Taylor and Gorgoni Bow Rainy Day Label |journal=Record World |date=June 17, 1967 |volume=21 |issue=1045 |page=4}}</ref>

=== Train Wreck Records ===
In 2007, Taylor launched his own [[independent record label|independent label]], Train Wreck Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.markpuccimedia.com/train_wreck_more.htm|title=Train Wreck Records Press Release|website=Markpuccimedia.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Personal life ==
By Taylor's own accounts, from 1980 through 1995 he was very successful at, but unhappily addicted to, gambling professionally on [[blackjack]] in New Jersey [[casino]]s and on [[horse race]]s.  He then returned to music, starting by singing to his dying mother, Barbara Voight.<ref>{{cite web| year=2000| publisher=[[First Amendment Center]]| title=Speaking Freely: Chip Taylor| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djy1Lt75MJM| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]| title=Chip Taylor On Sunday Morning Show| date=December 2008| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eaJ_XLpU2E| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref> Taylor has said that the gambling addiction was hard on both himself and his family.  He has written that, after having an epiphany, he changed his attitude and created the "Church of the Train Wreck" self-help program for himself and others.<ref>{{cite web| last=Taylor| first=Chip| title=Church of the Train Wreck Introduction| url=https://www.trainwreckrecords.com/uploads/1/0/4/1/104195916/church_intro.pdf| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref>

Taylor continues to live in [[New York City]]. He has been married to Joan Carole Frey since 1964, and they have children and grandchildren. (Joan and Chip were temporarily divorced for several years, starting in the 1990s.)<ref>{{cite web| title='Wild Thing' returns: Yonkers-born Chip Taylor will perform an intimate show in Garrison| date=January 29, 2019| first=Steven P.| last=Marsh| publisher=[[The Journal News]]| url=https://www.lohud.com/story/entertainment/2019/01/29/chip-taylor-yonkers-born-country-singer-songwriter-reflects-career/2676781002/| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=[[Rock Cellar Magazine]]| title=Chip Taylor, 'Whiskey Salesman' and All-Time Great Songwriter With a Litany of Classic Hits (Q and A)| first=Ken| last=Sharp| date=May 13, 2019| url=https://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/chip-taylor-interview-songwriting-wild-thing-legacy/| access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref>
