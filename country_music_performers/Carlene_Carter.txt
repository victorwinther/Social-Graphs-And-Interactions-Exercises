'''Carlene Carter''' (born '''Rebecca Carlene Smith'''; September 26, 1955) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. She is the daughter of [[June Carter Cash]] and her first husband, [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]].

As of 2020, since 1978, Carter has recorded 12 albums, primarily on major labels. In the same timespan, she has released more than 20 singles, including three number three-peaking hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.

==Career==
Carlene Carter's earliest released solo recording was "Friendly Gates", a track included on her stepfather [[Johnny Cash]]'s 1974 album ''[[Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me|The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me]]'', and credited under the name Carlene Routh.

Her solo recording career began in the late 1970s with her eponymous debut album.<ref name=":0" /> In 1979, during a concert at New York City's [[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]], she introduced a song about mate-swapping called "Swap-Meat Rag", from her album ''Two Sides to Every Woman'', by stating, "Well, if that don't put the 'cunt' back in country, I don't know what does."<ref>{{cite book |author=Chapman, Marshall |title=Goodbye, little rock and roller |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=0-312-31568-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/goodbyelittleroc00chap }}</ref> Johnny Cash and June Carter were in the audience, unbeknownst to Carlene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlenecarterfanclub.com/press-group-299.html |title=The Official C.C.

Carter co-wrote a song with [[Guy Clark]]'s wife, [[Susanna Clark]], for [[Emmylou Harris]] on her 1978 ''[[Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town]]'' album, "[[Easy From Now On]]".

In 1983, she had a top-40 hit "I Couldn't Say No", a duet with [[Robert Ellis Orrall]].

In 1987, Carter joined with the singing trio [[The Carter Sisters]], consisting of her mother June Carter Cash and June's sisters [[Helen Carter|Helen]] and [[Anita Carter]]. Together, they formed a revived version of The [[Carter Family]], and were featured on a 1987 television episode of ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' along with Johnny Cash.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/artists/program170.html |title=Austin City Limits &#124; PBS Video |publisher=Pbs.org |access-date=April 7, 2014 |archive-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019051131/http://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/artists/program170.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Carter revived her solo career with the album ''[[I Fell in Love (album)|I Fell in Love]]'', in 1990. The album and title song topped the US country albums and singles charts, respectively.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Mark|date=5 March 1991|title=I Fell In Love review|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=66}}</ref> Following a lengthy stint living in the [[England|UK]] and in the run-up to her divorce from English singer-songwriter [[Nick Lowe]], Carter had returned to the U.S., where in 1988 she met musician [[Howie Epstein]], bassist in [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Epstein helped Carter get her career back on track, producing ''[[I Fell in Love (album)|I Fell in Love]]'' and co-authoring its title track with longtime collaborator, Milwaukee writer [[Perry M. Lamek]].<ref name=":02" /> In 1991, the song "[[I Fell in Love (Carlene Carter song)|I Fell in Love]]" earned a [[Grammy]] nomination for ''Best Female Country Vocal Performance''. The album, which featured straight-ahead, retro-sounding country (unlike her prior work, which had combined country, rock and roll and pop sounds) was among the first successes of the 1990s "neotraditionalist" movement in country.<ref name=":02" />

Three years later, Epstein produced Carter's follow-up CD ''[[Little Love Letters]]'', featuring the hit "[[Every Little Thing (Carlene Carter song)|Every Little Thing]]", which was one of the top-rated music videos of the year.

Carter provided the voice of Red in the 1994 [[Williams (gaming company)|Williams]] [[pinball]] machine, ''[[Red & Ted's Road Show]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Red & Ted's Road Show Pinball|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=34}}</ref> designed by [[Pat Lawlor]]. A clip of Carter's hit, "Every Little Thing", is played after the player scores a jackpot. A picture of Carter appears in the game's backglass artwork.

Carter had a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1994 film ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]''. She played a waitress on the gambling casino ship run by Commodore Duvall ([[James Coburn]]).

In 1995, Carter's ''[[Little Acts of Treason]]'' was well received critically, but failed to achieve the commercial success of Carter's two previous releases.<ref name=":0" /> In 1996, Carter released ''Hindsight 20/20'', a greatest-hits album, but it failed to achieve success.

She received a small amount of acclaim with the song "It Takes One to Know Me", which was released on the albums ''Johnny Cash: The Legend'' and ''Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash: Duets''. Originally recorded in 1977 with a full string backing group, it was lost in a tape collection in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]],  and then recovered in 2003. It then was remastered by her half-brother [[John Carter Cash]]. In the remastered version, John added his wife Laura (Carlene's sister-in-law) and his backing vocals and a guest appearance from Carlene herself—more than 25 years after she wrote and first recorded the song.

In 2005, she was played by Victoria Hester in the movie ''[[Walk the Line]]''.<ref name="Carlene Carter played by Hester">{{cite web |title=Walk the Line (2005) Acting Credits|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/306598/Walk-the-Line/cast |url-status=dead|archive-date=January 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130122615/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/306598/Walk-the-Line/cast|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=September 10, 2012}}</ref>

On November 20, 2008, Carlene Carter performed at [[Iron Horse Music Hall]] in Northampton, Massachusetts, accompanied by Mike Emerson ([[Elvin Bishop]], [[Tommy Castro]]) on piano and Sean Allen on electric guitar and later joined by her husband Joe Breen. Alluding to some of her past problems, she said, "I'm really fortunate to have been making records for 30 years...I've had some gaps where I was doing research."<ref>{{Cite web|last1=O'Hare|first1=Kevin|last2=Republican|first2=The|date=2008-11-21|title=Carlene Carter's Triumphant Comeback in Northampton|url=https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/2008/11/carlene_carters_triumphant_com.html|access-date=2021-04-18|website=masslive|language=en}}</ref>

On August 8, 2009, Carlene Carter played a live acoustic set at [[Heckscher Park (Huntington, New York)|Heckscher Park]] in [[Huntington, New York]]. During the performance, she stated that it was the first time in more than 30 years that she performed by herself. During her hour-long set, she played the title track from her latest release "Stronger", and said it was written in memory of her younger sister, who had died six years earlier. The track was performed on the piano and brought Carter to tears. Her younger sister is also mentioned in her track "Wildwood Rose". She ended the set by playing "[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken?]]" with the opening act: The Homegrown String Band, a family band from the area. She said it brought back memories of playing with her own family.

In 2014, she released her 10th studio album ''[[Carter Girl]]'' for [[Rounder Records]]. The album features 12 tracks written or co-written by members of the Carter Family: 10 pre-existing songs and two new originals. ''Carter Girl'' received universal acclaim and includes collaborations with [[Elizabeth Cook]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], and Carter Family members Lorrie Carter Bennett, Helen Carter, Anita Carter, June Carter Cash, and Johnny Cash.

Carter was the opening act on [[John Mellencamp]]'s 80-date Plain Spoken tour in 2015.<ref name="Yahoo.com">{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/john-mellencamp-announces-plain-spoken-193500725.html|title=John Mellencamp Announces Plain Spoken 2015 North American Tour|publisher=Yahoo.com|date=September 10, 2014|access-date=January 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802110708/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/john-mellencamp-announces-plain-spoken-193500725.html|archive-date=August 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Additionally, Carter collaborated extensively with Mellencamp on his 2017 album ''[[Sad Clowns & Hillbillies]]'', providing vocals on five tracks, as well as writing one ("Damascus Road") and co-writing another ("Indigo Sunset").<ref name="NPR.org">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/24/524382970/first-listen-john-mellencamp-sad-clowns-hillbillies|title= First Listen: John Mellencamp, 'Sad Clowns & Hillbillies'|publisher=NPR.org | date=April 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Teamrock.com">{{cite news|url=http://teamrock.com/review/2017-04-25/john-mellencamp-featuring-carlene-carter-sad-clowns-hillbillies-album-review|title= John Mellencamp featuring Carlene Carter – Sad Clowns & Hillbillies album review|publisher=Teamrock.com | date=April 25, 2017}} Retrieved April 30, 2017</ref>
