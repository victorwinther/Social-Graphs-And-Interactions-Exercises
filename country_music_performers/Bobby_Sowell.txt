==Biography==
Sowell was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and was named after a famous [[Southern Baptist]] preacher, Dr. Robert G. Lee.
When Sowell was drafted during the [[Vietnam War]], he dropped the initial and became Robert Lee Sowell. In music, his stage name has always been Bobby or Bobby Lee. Growing up in Memphis, Sowell had diverse musical influences. Early influences included [[Hank Williams]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Muddy Waters]]. But what really got his attention were the piano players of that day, [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Williams (pianist)|Roger Williams]] and [[Floyd Cramer]]. When Sowell was 16, he met Cramer, and the experience had a lasting effect on his music. His father played harmonica and piano by ear, and his mother sang and played the guitar; she sang on the radio in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], in the 1940s. They used to have regular family singalongs, inviting area musicians to join in. Early rock and roll along with [[rockabilly]], honkytonk, blues, gospel and his mother's country music had an influence on Sowell's creativity and can be heard in his music style throughout his career.

==Early life==
About the time Sowell was 12 years old, honkytonk and rockabilly music were thriving in Memphis, and he started playing in bars and [[nightclubs]] with much older musicians. They used to sneak him in the back door and hide him behind an upright piano where no one could see how young he was. Sowell also played a lot of sock hops. He joined his first band, the Red Notes, an [[instrumental]] group, in 1959. His parents' house hosted many [[jam sessions]] for area musicians. Many successful professional musicians have come out of Frayser suburb of Memphis, and Sowell has picked with most of them.

Around the age of 16 the [[British Invasion]] meant Sowell had to adapt to a new kind of music, in which the organ was a more prominent instrument than the piano. Sowell played in numerous groups in the 1960s. In 1966 he won the [[Mid-South Fair]] and was scheduled to appear on ''[[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]] and the Original Amateur Hour'' on [[CBS]] Television, but before he could go there, he was drafted and served in the [[Vietnam War]], and his music career was put on hold, although he played while in the military, NCO and Officers Clubs, winning talent shows. After the war and a bout with alcoholism, Sowell got back on the right track. He returned to his first love, the piano, playing and recording in an easy-listening style.

==Later life==

Bobby Sowell has been performing music professionally from 1959 to the present day. In 2010, he formed a new blues band, Coldwater Revival (CWR). He is actively performing solo gigs or with the band, recording new music.
