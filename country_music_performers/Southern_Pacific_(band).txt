'''Southern Pacific''' was an American [[country rock]] band that existed from 1983 to 1991. They are best known for hits such as "Any Way the Wind Blows" (1989), which was used in the [[soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Bernadette Peters]], and "New Shade of Blue" (1988, their highest-ranking single on the country charts in November of that year). Southern Pacific was named New Country Group of the Year when they debuted and have been honored by having their name added to the Country Music Association's Walkway of Stars in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

==History==
The band was formed in 1983 with former [[The Doobie Brothers|Doobie Brothers]] members [[Keith Knudsen]] and [[John McFee]] and bassist [[Jerry Scheff]]. Additional founding members include [[Timothy Goodman|Tim Goodman]] on vocals and keyboardist [[Glen Hardin]].  The group signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1984 through which their debut album, ''Southern Pacific'' was released the following year. Scheff left after the album debuted and was replaced by [[Stu Cook]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], while Kurt Howell replaced Hardin on keyboards. Cook and Howell would join the others in the release of ''Killbilly Hill'' in 1986. This album would feature the cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Pink Cadillac (song)|Pink Cadillac]]". Goodman left after the second album to pursue a solo career and was replaced by [[David Jenkins (musician)|David Jenkins]] (formerly of [[Pablo Cruise]]) in 1987 in time for the production of the group's third album ''Zuma'' (1988) where their highest ranking single "New Shade of Blue" was included. Jenkins left after ''Zuma'' and the group remained a quartet for the final album ''County Line'' (1990) which included the single "Any Way The Wind Blows" that was used in the ''Pink Cadillac'' soundtrack and film that same year. ''County Line'' also featured a guest appearance from [[The Beach Boys]] on backing vocals on a cover of "[[GTO (Ronny & the Daytonas song)|GTO]]" by the Beach Boys' contemporaries [[Ronny & the Daytonas]].<ref name="Bellagio Guest Appearances">{{cite web |display-authors=et al. |last1=Doe |first1=Andrew G. |title=Guest Appearances |url=http://bellagio10452.com/guesting.html |website=Bellagio10452.com |access-date=July 11, 2024}}</ref>
Southern Pacific covered the [[Roky Erickson]] song "It's a Cold Night For Alligators" for the tribute album ''[[Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson]]''. (Cook had produced more than a dozen of Erickson's songs in 1979, which became Erickson's album ''[[The Evil One]]''.)<ref name=AusChron2017>{{cite news |last=Bentley |first=Bill |date=2017-04-21 |title=Record Store Day Unearths a Roky Erickson Rarity |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2017-04-21/record-store-day-unearths-a-roky-erickson-rarity/ |work=[[Austin Chronicle]] |location=[[Austin, Texas]] |access-date=2020-09-10 }}</ref> The group disbanded and Warner Bros. released their ''Greatest Hits'' album in 1991.

After Southern Pacific's breakup, Knudsen and McFee and Cook formed the super group, Jackdawg, and recorded one album that received critical acclaim. Subsequently both McFee and Knudsen returned to The Doobie Brothers (who had already reunited in 1987). Knudsen died in 2005 while McFee continues to tour with The Doobies. Cook toured with fellow Creedence Clearwater Revival band member [[Doug Clifford]] with the group Cosmo's Factory (now [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]]). Goodman continued to tour and record with The Magic Music Band and his solo project, The Tim Goodman Band. Howell formed his own music group, called [[Burnin' Daylight]]. This group also included former [[Exile (American band)|Exile]] member Sonny LeMaire and Nashville songwriter Marc Beeson.

Southern Pacific's four studio albums were reissued in 2003 by specialty label [[Wounded Bird Records]] in two double-CD packages.

Cook was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] with Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1993. Both Knudsen (posthumous) and McFee were inducted with the Doobie Brothers in 2020.
