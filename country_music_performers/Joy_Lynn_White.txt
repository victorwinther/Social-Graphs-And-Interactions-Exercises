'''Joy Lynn White''' (born October 2, 1961) (also known as '''Joy White''') is an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter. White was born in Bentonville, Arkansas but raised in [[Mishawaka, Indiana]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024036/http://www.cmt.com/artists/joy-lynn-white/ Joy Lynn White | New Music And Songs | CMT] Retrieved 2014-11-15.</ref> Signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1992, she released her debut album ''Between Midnight & Hindsight'' that same year. In 1993, she was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards, along with [[Martina McBride]] and [[Michelle Wright]], but lost to Wright. A critical favorite, reviewer [[Alanna Nash]] once described White as "a fiery redhead with a wild-and-wounded delivery and an attitude that says she’s not to be ignored." The [[Dixie Chicks]] covered both "[[Cold Day in July]]" from White's first album and "[[Tonight the Heartache's on Me]]" from her ''Wild Love'' album.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of her ''Wild Love'' release, White gave a rare interview from her home near [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to journalist Joseph Fenity. This was White's first on-camera interview in two decades.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yO3OEVUOZ4 |title=Joy Lynn White {{!}} Her first interview in decades! {{!}} 90s country music |date=2024-08-11 |last=Joseph Fenity |access-date=2024-08-13 |via=YouTube}}</ref>
