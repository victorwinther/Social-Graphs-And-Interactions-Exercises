'''Uncle Earl''' is an American [[old-time music]] group, formed in 2000<ref name="faq"/> by [[KC Groves]] and Jo Serrapere.<ref name="newsletter"/> Currently the lineup consists of four women, all of whom share vocal duties: KC Groves, [[Kristin Andreassen]], [[Abigail Washburn]], and [[Rayna Gellert]]. They have released three albums and two EPs, and their fifth album ''Waterloo, Tennessee'' was produced by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]].

==History==

===1999-2002: Founding===
Groves and Serrapere, both American songwriters and multi-instrumentalists, started the band in 2000.<ref name="faq"/> The Uncle Earl biography, however, states 1999 as founding year. According to the founders, they had no original interest in starting a band. Instead, they wanted to promote a CD with traditional material they had recorded, and put together a small temporary lineup to play a few shows. After the initial performances went well, the group decided to stay together.<ref name="biouncleearl"/> Until the end of 2003 the line-up of the band had changed several times. Amongst the members in this period where Tahmineh Gueramy (fiddle, vocals), Amanda Kowalski (bass, vocals), Casey Henry (banjo, vocals) and Sally Truitt (bass, vocals).<ref name="webarchive"/>

Groves mentioned in an interview how the band got its name, "We just thought it would be a funny name for an all-women's group," she says. "But we are fans of [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Uncle Tupelo]]. It did come up in our discussion that there's some important Earls in this business. And Uncles."<ref name="realcountry"/> They refer to themselves as "the g'Earls," while their fans have been nicknamed "g'Earlfriends."<ref name="newsletter"/>

===2002-2010: Albums===

In 2002 the band released their album ''She Went Upstairs''.

Founding member Serrapere left in 2003, and as of 2008 played with the Willie Dunns.<ref name="Willie Dunns"/> By the end of 2003 a long-lasting lineup was in place, with all the band members serving as co-vocalists.  The 2003 lineup consisted of KC Groves on [[mandolin]] and [[guitar]], [[Abigail Washburn]] on [[banjo]], [[Rayna Gellert]] on [[fiddle]] and [[Kristin Andreassen]], [[guitarist]], [[fiddler]], and [[clogging]].  There was no permanent [[bassist|bass player]].<ref name="blogsa"/>

In 2004, the group released their first EP, titled ''Going to the Western Slope.'' Several months later, they released their sophomore EP ''Raise a Ruckus.'' In 2005 the band was signed to [[Rounder Records]], who released their first full-length album, ''She Waits for Night'', later that year. Their second full-length album, ''Waterloo, TN'', was released on Rounder Records in 2007.

In late 2009, the band failed to go on tour, quoting trouble coordinating band members' schedules.<ref name="blogsa"/>

===2010-present===
In 2010, the band announced that Gellert and Washburn had left on amicable terms, and were pursuing other musical projects.<ref name="blogsa"/> The new Uncle Earl line up is Andreassen, Groves, Stephanie Coleman on [[fiddle]], Paula Bradley on [[banjo]], [[banjo ukulele]] and [[clogging]], and Rachel Eddy on [[banjo]], [[fiddle]], and [[Bass (guitar)|bass]].<ref name="Introductions and Updates"/> The lineup toured in support of their previous album in 2010, and continue to periodically perform.

===Bass players===
The band has had a mostly rotating line-up of bass players. For nearly four years Amanda Kowalski played [[Double bass|upright bass]] with Uncle Earl. [[Sharon Gilchrist]] joined the band in late 2004 and can be heard on the seven song [[Extended play|EP]] ''Raise a Ruckus''.<ref name="ruckus">{{cite web | title=Raise a Ruckus Liner Notes | work=Uncle Earl | url=http://www.uncleearl.net/ruckus.htm | date=April 2005 | access-date=2007-06-14 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704061747/http://uncleearl.net/ruckus.htm | archive-date=2007-07-04 }}</ref> There is a long list of other bassists with whom Uncle Earl have performed. On their website the band mentions Eric Thorin, Sally Truitt, Erin Coats Youngberg, Alana Rocklin, Mary Lucey, [[Bryn Davies (musician)|Bryn Davies]], [[Laura Cortese]], Kyle Kegerreis, [[Missy Raines]], and Dan Rose, with whom they recorded the album ''She Waits for Night''.<ref name="faq"/><ref name="newsletter04">{{cite web | title=Uncle Earl Newsletter Nov. 2004 | work=Uncle Earl | url=http://www.uncleearl.net/newsletterarchives/newsletternov04.htm | access-date=2007-06-12 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013645/http://www.uncleearl.net/newsletterarchives/newsletternov04.htm | archive-date=2007-09-28 }}</ref> Youngberg and Thorin play bass on the album ''Waterloo, Tennessee''.

Bassist [[Sharon Gilchrist]] left the band in early 2005 to play [[mandolin]] in the [[Peter Rowan]] and [[Tony Rice]] Quartet. However Gilchrist played again at their 2010 Australian Tour. Rachel Eddy joined so [[KC Groves]] largely handles the bass.<ref name="Introductions and Updates"/>
