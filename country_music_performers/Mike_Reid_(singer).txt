'''Michael Barry Reid''' (born May 24, 1947)<ref name="nsf" /> is an American [[country music]] artist, composer, and former professional [[American football|football]] player. He played as a [[defensive tackle]] for five seasons with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).

Born and raised in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], Reid attended and graduated from [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he played [[college football]] for the [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State Nittany Lions]]. Selected by the Bengals in the first round of the [[1970 NFL draft]] with the seventh overall pick, he earned trips to the [[Pro Bowl]] after the 1972 and 1973 seasons, before retiring after the 1974 season. He subsequently focused on his musical career, co-writing several hit singles for country music artists, including [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s "[[Stranger in My House (Ronnie Milsap song)|Stranger in My House]]", which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1984. Reid later began a solo recording career, releasing two studio albums for [[Columbia Records]]. He charted seven singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart as a singer, including the number one hit "[[Walk on Faith]]".

==Football career==
At college, Reid was a captain on both the Nittany Lions undefeated 1968 and 1969 teams that went 22–0.
In his senior year (1969), the tackle spearheaded Penn State on defense with 89 [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]] and was a unanimous [[1969 College Football All-America Team|All-America]] choice and All-East selection. He won the Outland Trophy as the best College football interior lineman in 1969, and also was awarded the 1969 [[Maxwell Award]] and finished fifth in the [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting. Reid also [[Collegiate wrestling|wrestled]] at Penn State and in 1967 he won the Eastern heavyweight wrestling title.<ref>[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/psu/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/Hall_of_Fame] {{dead link|date=November 2021}}</ref> In addition to athletics, Reid played Chicago gangster Big Julie in Penn State's production of the musical Guys and Dolls.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/penn-state/article231555948.html|title="Experience the genuine." Former Penn State football star Mike Reid talks new musical|author=Sarah Paez|website=Centredaily.com|access-date=November 18, 2021}}</ref>

Reid was the first-round selection (#7 pick overall) of the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in the [[1970 NFL draft]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1970 NFL Draft Listing |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1970/draft.htm |website=Pro-Football Reference |access-date=6 January 2021}}</ref> In the team's third season, it won the [[American Football Conference Central Division|AFC Central Division]] and made the playoffs. In 1971, Reid established himself as one of the NFL's best pass rushers by recording 12 [[Quarterback sack|sack]]s, a figure he repeated in 1972. In 1971 Reid was a consensus All-AFC selection and the following year he was consensus [[All-Pro]] as well as being voted consensus All-AFC again.

In 1973, he topped those marks by recording 13 sacks. He was named All-Pro by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA) and was second-team All-Pro according to the [[Associated Press]] and [[Pro Football Writers Association]]. For the third consecutive season Reid was consensus All-AFC.

In 1974, due primarily to injuries, he recorded only seven sacks, bringing his career total to 49. In his final season, Reid was again an All-AFC selection by ''[[Pro Football Weekly]]''. Although sacks were an unofficial statistic, the Bengals kept track of them and Reid retired as the leading sacker in the team's short history.

He made two trips to the [[Pro Bowl]] (1972 and 1973) before his retirement following the [[1974 NFL season|1974 season]] due to knee and hand injuries and his desire to focus on a music career. In 1996, he received the [[National Football League Alumni|NFL Alumni]] Career Achievement Award for his success in his post-NFL career.

He was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1987 and received the [[Walter Camp Alumni of the Year|Walter Camp "Alumnus of the Year"]] award in 1987. In 1995, he received the [[List of Silver Anniversary Awards (NCAA) Recipients|NCAA Silver Anniversary Award]]. Reid was named as part of the Bengals' 40th Anniversary All-Time team in 2007. In 2017, Reid was named as part of the Bengals' 50th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==Music career==
After receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in music from [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1969, Reid would perform as a pianist for the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra]], [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paez |first1=Sarah |title='Experience the genuine.' Former Penn State football star Mike Reid talks new musical |url=https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/penn-state/article231555948.html |publisher=Centre Daily |access-date=6 January 2021}}</ref>

When he abandoned his football career, he formed a band and began playing at a Holiday Inn location across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, then abandoned the idea of performing in bands and began playing solo at the Blind Lemon, and in the process, beginning to write his own songs. Living in Mount Lookout, he drove Eastern Avenue daily, and slowly "Eastern Avenue River Railway Blues" grew out of that. After a gig in Atlanta, Reid and some other musicians attended Southeastern Music Hall about 3:30&nbsp;a.m. A cassette tape of that session somehow found its way to Jerry Jeff Walker, who, in 1978, became the first artist to record a Reid song, that being "Eastern Avenue River Railway Blues".<ref>"An American Poet" by Roger Naylor, Cincinnati Magazine, October 1988, pages 36-37</ref>

In 1980, Reid moved to Nashville, and quickly became known as an in-demand songwriter for [[Ronnie Milsap]]. [[Larry Gatlin]] also helped Reid spearhead his songwriting career.

In 1984, Reid won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] with "[[Stranger in My House (Ronnie Milsap song)|Stranger in My House]]", which was recorded by Ronnie Milsap. Reid would also contribute compositions to artists such as [[Marie Osmond]], [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Collin Raye]], [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], and [[Conway Twitty]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, Reid wrote 12 No. 1 singles<ref name=nsf>{{cite web|title=Mike Reid|url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/p-s/mike-reid.aspx|work=Nashville Songwriters Foundation|access-date=17 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216151416/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/p-s/mike-reid.aspx|archive-date=16 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> including "[[Forever's as Far as I'll Go]]", which was recorded in 1990 by [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]; their 29th number one country hit. He was also featured as a guest vocalist on Milsap's "[[Old Folks (Ronnie Milsap and Mike Reid song)|Old Folks]]", a No.&nbsp;2 hit from early 1988.  He also co-wrote, with [[Allen Shamblin]], [[Bonnie Raitt]]'s hit "[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]", which reached #18 on the Billboard Pop Charts and has been covered by countless artists.

In 1990, Reid signed to [[Columbia Records]] as a recording artist. His debut album ''[[Turning for Home]]'' produced a No. 1 country hit in its lead-off single "[[Walk on Faith]]", although the album's other singles were not as successful. His second album, 1992's ''[[Twilight Town]]'', produced two singles which both missed the Top 40.

A third album, ''New Direction Home,'' was released two decades later in 2012 by the small Off Row Records label<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/music1502029/mike-reid-nfl-all-pro-turned-country-music-hitmaker|title=The NFL's country music hit maker|date=16 January 2015|website=Espn.com|access-date=18 November 2021}}</ref> and is available on iTunes and Spotify as well as in an mp3 download from Reid's website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mikereidmusic.com/|title=HOME|website=Mikereidmusic.com|access-date=18 November 2021}}</ref>

By 1991, Reid composed the music for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] musical ''A House Divided''. Over the following two decades, he wrote more [[Musical theatre|musicals]], including ''Quilts'', ''Different Fields'', ''Eye of the Blackbird'', ''Tales of Appalachia'', ''In This House'', and ''The Ballad of Little Jo'', a 1997 winner of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|Academy of Arts and Letters']] '[[Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater]]'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsandletters.org/awards2_popup.php?abbrev=rodgers |title=American Academy of Arts and Letters - Award Winners |access-date=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912211155/http://www.artsandletters.org/awards2_popup.php?abbrev=Rodgers |archive-date=2010-09-12 }} Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gene-watson.com/index.php/peers/peers-2012/mike-reid.html|title=Original Gene Watson Fan Site - Gene Watson's Peers: Quote from Mike Reid: May 2012|website=Gene-watson.com|access-date=18 November 2021}}</ref>

In 2019, he again returned to the musical theater stage with ''The Last Day,'' a commissioned production co-written with NYU Tisch School of Performing Arts Assistant Dean, Sarah Schlesinger, for Reid's alma mater, Penn State.<ref name="auto"/>

Reid was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Foundation|Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2005.<ref name="nsf" />
