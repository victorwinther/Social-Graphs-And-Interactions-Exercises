===Music career===
[[Curb Records]] signed Kersh in 1996, and his debut album, ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (album)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'', was released the same year, with its [[Goodnight Sweetheart (David Kersh song)|title track]] peaking at No. 6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart. The album also featured the No.&nbsp;3 single "[[Another You (David Kersh song)|Another You]]" (which was written by a then-unknown [[Brad Paisley]]) and the No.&nbsp;11 "[[Day In, Day Out (David Kersh song)|Day In, Day Out]]".

In 1998, Kersh's second album was released. ''[[If I Never Stop Loving You]]'' was the name of both the album and its [[If I Never Stop Loving You (song)|lead-off single]], which was also a No.&nbsp;3. The album also featured "[[I Breathe In, I Breathe Out]]", co-written by [[Chris Cagle]]; although Kersh's version of the song was never issued as a single, Cagle would later cut the song himself and take it to Number One on the country music charts in early 2002. "If I Never Stop Loving You" was followed by a No.&nbsp;29-peaking cover of [[Eric Clapton]]'s "[[Wonderful Tonight]]", and the No.&nbsp;46 "Something to Think About".

In 1999, Kersh received a nomination by the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist of the Year]], alongside [[Deryl Dodd]] and [[Mark Wills]], losing to Wills.
