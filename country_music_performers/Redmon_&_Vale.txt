'''Redmon & Vale''' was an American [[country music]] duo formed in 1997 by Allison Redmon and Tina Vale, both of whom served as vocalists. They met through a common friend, with whom they initially performed as a trio before deciding to work as a duo instead after the trio split up.<ref name="allmusic"/>

The duo released a self-titled studio album and two singles in 1999 on [[DreamWorks Records]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p376046/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Redmon & Vale biography |accessdate=2008-07-24 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The album included two singles, both of which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Jeffrey B. Remz of ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' gave the album a negative review, saying that it "mine[d] the generic, overproduced field of bland pop country."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2332 |title=Redmon and Vale|accessdate=2008-07-24 |last=Remz |first=Jeffrey B. |work=[[Country Standard Time]]}}</ref> A reviewer for ''[[The Technique]]'', the student newspaper for the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], gave the album a more positive review, noting that the two singers seemed to focus more on harmonies than most other country groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/1999-09-17/entertainment/8 |title=Redmon & Vale: Country Can Be Good |accessdate=2008-07-24 |last=Dickenson |first=Darren |date=1999-09-17 |work=[[The Technique]] }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album's first single, "If I Had a Nickel (One Thin Dime)" reached No.&nbsp;65 on the country charts, while the second single, "Squeezin' the Love Outta You", peaked at No.&nbsp;74. The latter was also recorded by [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]] (who co-wrote it) on her 2004 album ''[[Dress Rehearsal (Carolyn Dawn Johnson album)|Dress Rehearsal]]''.
