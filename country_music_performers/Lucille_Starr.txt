She was best known for her 1964 [[hit record|hit]] single, "The French Song" ("''Quand Le Soleil Dit Bonjour Aux Montagnes''", When the sun says hello to the mountains).

==Early life==
Starr was born in the [[Franco-Manitoban]] community of [[Saint Boniface, Winnipeg|Saint Boniface]] to a musical family. During her childhood years in Saint Boniface, she first sang in church.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winnipeg-born Lucille Starr shone brightly around the world |author=John Einarson |date=October 2, 2020 |url=https://whatsupwinnipeg.ca/winnipeg-born-lucille-starr-shone-brightly-around-the-world/}}</ref> When Starr was seven the family moved to [[Maillardville]], a [[Francophone]] community in [[Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]], where she learned to play guitar, bass and mandolin.

==Career==
Savoie started her musical career with the local group Les Hirondelles.  She met and married country singer Bob Regan (born Robert Frederickson),<ref name=Globe/> and, using the stage name Lucille Starr, she began performing with him as a country singing duo called "Bob & Lucille". Between 1958 and 1963 they released several [[Gramophone record|45 rpm records]] that were mainly covers of an eclectic mix of fashionable [[country music|country]], [[popular music|pop]], [[rockabilly]] and [[Folk music|folk]] songs of people such as [[Perry Como]] to [[Connie Francis]]. Their records met with modest success on the North American [[Pacific Coast|West Coast]]<ref name="Davis1997">{{cite book |author=Chuck Davis |title=The greater Vancouver book: an urban encyclopaedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiB6AAAAMAAJ |date=January 1, 1997 |publisher=Linkman Press |isbn=978-1-896846-00-2 |page=683}}</ref> and in 1963 they were signed by [[A&M Records]] in Los Angeles, California, with which they began recording as "[[The Canadian Sweethearts]]".

At A&M Records, Starr recorded a song called "The French Song" that was produced by [[Herb Alpert]].<ref name="Inc.1964">{{cite magazine |title=Lucille Star does single for A&M |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40 |date=May 16, 1964 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=40– |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> This name was chosen because Alpert could not pronounce the original French title "Quand le soleil dit bonjour aux montagnes" (When the sun says Good day to the mountains).<ref name=Globe>{{cite web |last1=Jennings |first1=Nicholas |title=Country singer Lucille Starr mastered yearning ballads and rockabilly yelps |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/article-country-singer-lucille-starr-mastered-yearning-ballads-and-rockabilly/ |website=The Globe and Mail |access-date=10 September 2022 |date=12 September 2020 |quote=Mr. Alpert produced her solo debut album, featuring a yearning French ballad, Quand le soleil dit bonjour aux montagnes, which was renamed The French Song because he couldn’t pronounce the original title.}}</ref> It was recorded in a bilingual version with French lyrics in the first half followed by the English translation in the second half.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Starr |first1=Lucille |title=The French Song First Recording |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35WLFvVL2Sg |website=YouTube |access-date=10 September 2022}}</ref> In 1964, at a time when [[The Beatles]] dominated the music charts, "The French Song" was an international success that made Starr the first Canadian artist to have a record sell over a million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/183 183] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/183}}</ref> The popularity of the song led to a tour of the United States and appearing on the [[Louisiana Hayride]] radio show and on Chicago radio station [[WLS (AM)]] popular [[National Barn Dance]]. Starr also sang on American television musical variety shows such as ''[[Shindig!]]'' and ''[[Hullabaloo (television)|Hullabaloo]]'', followed by tours of [[Pacific Rim]] countries, Australia, South Africa, and across Europe where she became a particular favorite in the [[Netherlands]]. The song sold over one million copies, and it was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

In 1967, Starr and her Canadian Sweethearts duo signed a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="Murrells1978">{{cite book |author=Joseph Murrells |title=The Book of Golden Discs |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr |url-access=registration |year=1978 |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins |isbn=978-0-214-20480-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/183 183]}}</ref> Divorced from her first husband, their musical collaboration ended in 1977. Although she never again had a hit of the magnitude of "The French Song", Starr enjoyed a long and prosperous career recording primarily in English but also in French and Spanish. For the most part she sang [[country music]], becoming the first female inducted into the [[Canadian Country Music Association]]’s [[Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame|"Hall of Honor"]] in 1987.<ref>[http://www.ccma.org/cgi/page.cgi/hall_of_fame_inductees.html?log=view&log_id=7 "Hall of Fame Inductees: Lucille Starr"]. Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame website</ref> A capable yodeler, she was hired to do the yodeling for the "Cousin Pearl" character on several segments of the hit TV series, ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.

''Back to You: the Life and Music of Lucille Starr'', a [[jukebox musical]] with a script by Tracey Power, was performed at the [[Prairie Theatre Exchange]] in Winnipeg in November 2010.<ref>[http://www.pte.mb.ca/plays/current/plays29.htm?season= ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905191844/http://www.pte.mb.ca/plays/current/plays29.htm?season= |date=September 5, 2010 }}</ref>

In her honour, a street in the city of Coquitlam was named "Lucille Starr Way".

==Death==
Starr died in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the early morning hours of September 4, 2020. The announcement of her death was made on Facebook by fellow Canadian artist, Joyce Smith.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lucille-starr-country-music-manitoba-1.5714448 "Manitoba-born country music queen Lucille Starr dies at 82"].
