Scott Sexton writes from Country Music About.com  "Kellie Coffey's sophomore CD lets you look into her true range as a singer and a songwriter. From the first song to the last you are left wanting more. Kellie co-wrote eleven of the twelve songs on this album, and they are all truly unique. Every song sounded like it came straight from her heart, which made the album that much more enjoyable."

The following year, Coffey did a campaign with the Susan G. Komen Foundation in the production of the video for the title track of her independent album, "Walk On".  The video features documentary footage of participants in breast cancer walks.

In 2010 Coffey was the subject of the feature documentary film, "Kellie Coffey: I'm Still Here".  On May 26, 2013, she performed "Walk On" at a memorial service for the victims of the May 20 tornado which hit her hometown of Moore.

==Personal life==
Coffey is married to songwriter Geoff Koch. They have a son, Jackson, who was born in November 2005,<ref name="weekly"/> and a daughter, Maggie, born in May 2008.<ref name="whereare"/> She has two brothers named Robert and John.
