'''The Tractors''' were  an American [[country rock]] band composed of a loosely associated group of musicians headed by guitarist [[Steve Ripley]]. The original lineup consisted of Steve Ripley (lead vocals, guitar), Ron Getman (guitar, [[Dobro]], [[mandolin]], tenor vocals), Walt Richmond (keyboards, piano, bass vocals), Casey van Beek (bass guitar, baritone vocals), and [[Jamie Oldaker]] (drums). Under the band's original lineup, they signed to [[Arista Nashville]] in 1994, releasing their [[The Tractors (album)|self-titled debut album]] that year; the album only produced one Top 40 hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country charts]]. 

Since their foundation, most of the band's original members moved on to separate projects, although they often collaborated with frontman Ripley on The Tractors' more recent recordings. Ripley was the only official member of the group throughout its tenure; he had stated that The Tractors was more of a "state of mind",<ref name="tractors2">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetractors.com/|title=THE TRACTORS|website=Thetractors.com|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> and the band contained a largely undefined cast of unofficial contributors.

==Biography==
The Tractors were formed in 1988 by [[Steve Ripley]].<ref name="cst1">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=807|title=The Tractors plow ahead – November 1998|website=Countrystandardtime.com|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> The original lineup comprised Ron Getman ([[electric guitar]] and [[slide guitar]]); [[Jamie Oldaker]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]); Walt Richmond ([[bass (vocal range)|bass]] vocals, [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]); [[Steve Ripley]] (guitar, [[Singing|lead vocals]]); and Casey Van Beek ([[bass guitar]], [[baritone]] vocals).<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-tractors-mn0000481827/biography|title=The Tractors - Biography & History|website=AllMusic|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> All five members had previously been backing musicians for other notable artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Leonard Cohen]].<ref name="cst1"/> Oldaker had also played with [[Leon Russell]], [[Peter Frampton]], and [[Bob Seger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tulsaworld.com/entertainment/music/tulsa-sound-musician-jamie-oldaker-dies-peter-frampton-eric-clapton-praise-hall-of-fame-drummer/article_c5b46473-6720-59ed-8a87-de371587dbe1.html|title=Tulsa Sound musician Jamie Oldaker dies; Peter Frampton, Eric Clapton praise hall of fame drummer|last = Tramel|first = Jimmie|website = [[Tulsa World]]|date=17 July 2020 |accessdate=5 September 2021}}</ref>

By 1990, the group was signed to Arista Nashville, a newly formed record label based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and a subsidiary of [[Arista Records]].<ref name="cst1"/> In 1994, they released their self-titled debut album, which produced the single, "[[Baby Likes to Rock It]]," and soon became the fastest-selling debut album from a country group to reach platinum status. A Christmas album titled ''[[Have Yourself a Tractors Christmas]]'' soon followed.<ref name="allmusic"/>

The Tractors were nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-06-ca-17089-story.html|title=The 37th Grammy Nominations|date=6 January 1995|website=Articles.latimes.com|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9601/grammy_noms/grammy_list.html|title=CNN - List of Grammy nominees - Jan. 4, 1996|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> and won the [[Country Weekly]] 1995 Golden Pick Award for Favorite New Group.

Their second album, ''Farmers in a Changing World'', was released in 1998.<ref name="tractors2"/> The band's members, except for Ripley, soon departed for other projects, although they and Ripley remained close friends and made cameo appearances on subsequent albums.<ref name="cst2">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=808|title=The Tractors stay on track – May 2001|website=Countrystandardtime.com|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> Ripley released the next Tractors album, ''Fast Girl'', with several other musicians on [[Audium Entertainment]] in 2001. After ''Fast Girl'', the Tractors left Audium and formed their own label, Boy Rocking Records. In 2009, the album, ''Trade Union'', was released on the E1 label.

Three of the group's five original members have since died; Steve Ripley died at age 69 after a lengthy battle with cancer on January 3, 2019;<ref name = TWObit>{{cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/entertainment/oklahoma-music-artist-steve-ripley-dies/article_9cb0dc83-4d5c-5e43-b76c-becf9190f612.html|title = Oklahoma music artist Steve Ripley dies|last = Tramel|first = Jimmie|website = [[Tulsa World]]|date = January 4, 2019|accessdate = January 4, 2019}}</ref> Jamie Oldaker died at age 68 on July 16, 2020, also having succumbed to cancer;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theboot.com/jamie-oldaker-the-tractors-dead-dies/|title = Jamie Oldaker of the Tractors Dead at 68|website = The Boot|date = July 16, 2020|accessdate = August 7, 2021}}</ref> and Ron Getman died at age 71 on January 12, 2021, after a brief undisclosed illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poncacitynow.com/obituaries/obituary-for-ron-getman/|title = Obituary for Ron Getman|website = PoncaCity Now|date = January 20, 2021|accessdate = August 7, 2021}}</ref> The two surviving original members – Casey Van Beek and Walt Richmond – continue to be musically active, having formed a group named Casey Van Beek and the Tulsa Groove, and releasing an album titled ''Heaven Forever'' as recently as 2020; Getman was a brief contributor to this group before his own death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tulsaworld.com/entertainment/music/album-is-next-chapter-of-tulsan-casey-van-beeks-storied-life-in-music/article_6fcb46b2-2d7a-5189-aebb-e72261b7329b.html|title = Album is next chapter of Tulsan Casey Van Beek's storied life in music|last = Tramel|first = Jimmie|website = [[Tulsa World]]|date = March 15, 2020|accessdate = August 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://littlevillagefoundation.com/casey-van-beek-and-the-tulsa-groove/|title = Casey Van Beek and the Tulsa Groove|website = Little Village Foundation|date = 19 February 2020|accessdate = August 7, 2021}}</ref>

==Sound==
The Tractors achieved their distinctive sound in several ways, most notably from the use of old school 'minimal' recording techniques, and an emphasis on capturing everything in one take.<ref name="mix">{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_tractors_fresh_breeze/|title=The Tractors: A Fresh Breeze from Tulsa|website=Mixonline.com|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref> Ripley often constructed guitars and cords for use in the band.
