== Early life ==

(Tony) Anthony Ramey was born on April 17, 1974, in [[Kenova, West Virginia|Kenova]], [[West Virginia]]. He grew up in Kenova where his father was a journeyman for [[Owens-Illinois|Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] and his mother was a law department assistant. Tony has one older brother, Aca Ramey, a federal park ranger in [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington, WV]] for the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

Tony began earning [[royalties]] from his songs when he was only seventeen years old—garnering song credits on Nashville independent artists and acts working out of [[Branson, Missouri|Branson Missouri]].

After graduating from [[Ceredo-Kenova High School]], Tony earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in [[English Literature]] at [[Marshall University]].  While in college, Tony formed the Dixie Flyer Band, a country music [[cover band]] who also played Tony's original songs he had begun writing at the age of 11. After winning the [[Country Showdown|True-Value Country Showdown]], Dixie Flyer toured extensively throughout [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]], performing at fairs, festivals, and other music venues.  Tony moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and later worked on a PhD in English Literature with Concentrations in [[Old English]], Romanticism, and American Literature.  His scholarship and work in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] garnered a [http://www.mtsu.edu/english/awards/wolfewinners.php Wolfe Award] from MTSU's graduate school for excellence in critical writing and research.

==Music career==

Ramey's frequent performances included opening for [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Dan Seals]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[George Jones]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Glen Campbell]], and other [[Country music|Country Music]] artists.

Ramey was offered a deal on [[Polydor Records|Polydor Polygram]]/[[Mercury Records]], but shortly thereafter the Polygram division was bought by [[A&M Records|A&M]] of California and the Nashville office was closed.  Ramey began working with [[Tom Collins (producer)|Tom Collins]], a producer and publisher on Nashville's [[Music Row]].  Ramey's first gold record as a songwriter, "I Don't Want This Song to End, was recorded by [[John Michael Montgomery]].

Several years later, Tony and Tom Collins amicably parted ways. Not long after, Ramey was invited to do a songwriting round at the [[Bluebird Café]]. While performing at Bluebird, Ramey was seen by the creative director of Muy Bueno Music, owned by country music artist [[George Strait]].  While at Muy Bueno, Ramey amassed a catalog of more than 900 songs and several country Top Forty, international Top Forty, and [[gold record]] and [[platinum record]] hits.

In 2007, Tony left Muy Bueno to sign with [[Cherry Lane Music]] of New York, which began by publishing songs from the iconic [[John Denver]] and [[Elvis Presley]].  Ramey's songs were performed on television and in film, and by Canadian, Australian, and European musicians.  While at Cherry Lane, Ramey produced and released his self-titled fifth [[studio album]].

In the spring of 2011, Tony moved to [[Greenville, Texas]], where he is continuing to write music, and has undertaken a concert tour throughout the US.  After moving to Texas, he recorded CDs ''Throwback'', ''Soul Survivor'' (which features Willie Nelson), and ''The'' ''Spirit of Hank and the Heart of James Dean''.  He is the recipient of the [http://cmaoftexas.com Country Music Association of Texas] Independent Artist of the Year Award in 2016.
