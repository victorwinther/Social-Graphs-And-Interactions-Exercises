She has released five albums: three for [[RCA Records]], one for [[Rising Tide Records]] and one for [[Dualtone Records]], and has charted in the top 40 of the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts with "Baby, Walk On" and "The Things You Left Undone," both at No.&nbsp;36. Besides most of her own material, Berg has written hits for [[T.G. Sheppard]], [[Karen Brooks (singer)|Karen Brooks]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Deana Carter]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Kenny Chesney]] and others. In 2008 she was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and in 2018 she received the Poet's Award from the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]].

==Early history==
Matraca Maria Berg was born February 3, 1964, in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Berg's mother, Icie Calloway,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ul75bqlHU2QC&dq=%22Icie+Calloway%22&pg=PA245 Howard, Jason (2012).  ''A Few Honest Words: The Kentucky Roots of Popular Music'' Lexington, KY: The University of Kentucky Press] Retrieved May 29, 2016.</ref> moved from [[Harlan County, Kentucky]], to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the 1960s to seek her fortune as a singer and songwriter shortly before Matraca was born. Matraca's Aunt Sudie Calloway was a successful [[Music Row]] backing singer. Aunts Coleida Calloway and Clara Howard were backing vocalists on Kentucky's [[Renfro Valley Barn Dance]]. Uncle Jim Baker was a [[steel guitar]] player who also spent some time running [[Mel Tillis]]'s song publishing companies.  When Matraca was 2 years old, her mother married [[nuclear physicist]] Ron Berg, who legally adopted Matraca.<ref>[http://countrymusichalloffame.org/contentpages/poets-and-prophets-salute-to-legendary-country-songwriter-matraca-berg McCall, Michael (2009).  "Poets and Prophets: Salute to Legendary Country Songwriter Matraca Berg." ''Country Music Hall of Fame'' (July 18, 2009).] Retrieved May 29, 2016.</ref><ref>[http://www.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/164-the-daughter-of-music-row Gleason, Holly (2014).  "The Daughter of Music Row."  ''The Oxford American'', 83, 1-22-2014.] Retrieved May 29, 2016</ref>

Berg's mother found only limited success in the music industry and eventually became a nurse. Berg herself then took up songwriting with her mother's encouragement. When Berg played her songs for songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]], he volunteered to co-write with her. She found her earliest success in their collaboration, "Faking Love", which was sung by [[Karen Brooks (singer)|Karen Brooks]] and [[T. G. Sheppard]], topping the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts on February 19, 1983.<ref name="allmusic"/>

==Career history==
After her mother's death in 1985, Berg continued to have success writing songs for other performers.  [[Reba McEntire]] had a No.&nbsp;1 song with her "The Last One to Know", and [[Randy Travis]], [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Marie Osmond]], [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]], [[Michelle Wright]] and others recorded her songs.

Berg signed to a recording contract with [[RCA Records]] Nashville in 1990, releasing her debut album ''Lying to the Moon'' that year. Its first two singles, "Baby, Walk On" and "The Things You Left Undone," both charted in the country top 40 at No.&nbsp;36, followed by the No.&nbsp;43 "I Got It Bad" and No.&nbsp;55 "I Must Have Been Crazy."

Matraca was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist by the [[Academy of Country Music]] in 1991, losing to [[Shelby Lynne]].<ref name="Past winners and nominees">{{Cite news |url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners |title=Winners database |work=ACM Country |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref>

What was to be her follow-up album, ''Bittersweet Surrender'', was recorded in 1991. It featured the single "It's Easy to Tell," which charted in November 1991. The album was rejected by the label, which wanted a more mainstream-sounding recording instead. One of the songs from this canceled album, "[[Wrong Side of Memphis]]," later became a Top Ten hit for [[Trisha Yearwood]]. She continued to write for others, and in 1994, released a pop album ''The Speed of Grace''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=RCA Relays Matraca Berg's 'Stories' A Second Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jggEAAAAMBAJ|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 10, 1999}}</ref>

Berg's 1995 song, "[[You Can Feel Bad]]", co-written with [[Tim Krekel]] and recorded by [[Patty Loveless]], was a Number 1 country single, spending twenty weeks on the charts.

Berg co-wrote "[[Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter song)|Strawberry Wine]]" along with [[Gary Harrison (songwriter)|Gary Harrison]], which [[Deana Carter]] released as a single. Berg won the "Song of the Year" at the 1997 CMA ([[Country Music Association]]) Awards. The same year, she released the album ''Sunday Morning to Saturday Night'' via [[Rising Tide Records]]; it produced the singles "That Train Don't Run" and "Back in the Saddle," the former of which was released by [[Pinmonkey]] in 2006. In 1999, RCA released a compilation album entitled ''Lying to the Moon & Other Stories'' which also included tracks from her 1997 Rising Tide release.

In 2004 and 2005, Berg was nominated for induction into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], making her one of the youngest nominees in history. She was eventually inducted in 2008.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120731184512/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,3034,GAC_26063_5938862_,00.html "Matraca Berg, John Hiatt, Tom Shapiro in Hall of Fame"]. ''[[Great American Country]]''. October 27, 2008.</ref> She continues to be a prolific and respected country songwriter.

==Personal life==
She currently lives in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] with her husband, [[Jeff Hanna]], a founding member of the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. They were married December 5, 1993. The couple met while touring with Clint Black in the late 1980s.
