'''Kenneth Edward Mellons''' (born July 10, 1965) is an American [[country music]] artist who released his [[Ken Mellons (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1994. This album produced the single "[[Jukebox Junkie]]", a Top Ten hit on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Mellons followed up his debut album with three more albums – 1995's ''[[Where Forever Begins (Ken Mellons album)|Where Forever Begins]]'', 2001's ''[[The Best of Ken Mellons]]'' and 2004's ''[[Sweet (Ken Mellons album)|Sweet]]'' — in addition to charting six more singles on the country charts.

==Biography==
Mellons was born in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]]. He has been a native of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], since the age of 3. He entered in many talent shows in high school, and played at various clubs around Nashville to help perfect his skill, while working day jobs to pay the bills.<ref name="allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p143155/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Ken Mellons > Biography )))]</ref> In 1989, Ken earned a spot at a show called Country Music USA at [[Opryland USA]], a theme park in Nashville. Later, he was signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1993.<ref name="allmusic"/> His debut, self-titled album produced a Top 10 single in "[[Jukebox Junkie]]", a song which also received [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] awards for surpassing one million [[spin (radio)|spins]] on radio. His second album, ''Where Forever Begins'', failed to produce any successful singles, and by 1997, Mellons left Epic Records.<ref name="oldies">[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Ken-Mellons.html Ken Mellons Biography: OLDIES.com]</ref>

Shortly after leaving Epic, Mellons signed to [[Curb Records]]. He released two non-charting singles and one album (''The Best of Ken Mellons'') during his six-year tenure with Curb. He became frustrated with the label and asked out of his record deal with them in 2003.<ref name="oldies"/> Mellons then moved to the independent Home Records, releasing the album ''Sweet'' in 2004. The album featured "[[Paint Me a Birmingham]]", which became a Top 5 country hit for [[Tracy Lawrence]] in the first half of 2004. Mellons also co-wrote the songs "Honk If You Honky Tonk" on George Strait's "Honkytonkville" album and "I Bought The Shoes" on [[Dierks Bentley]]'s [[Dierks Bentley (album)|self-titled debut album]].

Mellons continues to perform throughout the US and recorded a bluegrass album titled ''Rural Route'' in 2009.
