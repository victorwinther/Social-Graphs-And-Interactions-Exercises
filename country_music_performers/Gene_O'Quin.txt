'''Gene Louis O'Quin''' (or Oquin) (September 9, 1932 â€“ November 27, 1978)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Gene_O_Quin?id=Ay4gyiozpszk5gamtguybep3u2i |title=Gene O'Quin - Music on Google Play |website=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2020-04-13}}</ref> was an American [[country and western music|country and western]] and [[honky tonk]] singer born in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] on September 9, 1932<ref>{{cite web|first=Keven|last=Koffey|title=Bopping.org|url=http://www.bopping.org/eng/?p=2738|work=Citing liner notes for 'Boogie Woogie Fever'|date=4 February 2011|publisher=Bear Family|accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref> He established himself professionally at Dallas' Big "D" Jamboree, a [[Grand Ole Opry]]-like radio showcase, becoming one of its most popular entertainers. O'Quin recorded his first song at the age of 15 and was signed by [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|title=Guys of the Big "D" Jamboree - Various Artists|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blguysofbigdjamboreerev.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=26 January 2012|archive-date=20 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120050137/http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blguysofbigdjamboreerev.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He later relocated to California. His recording career reached its peak  between 1950 and 1955.

O'Quin's voice was high and nasally and had a twang evocative of [[Little Jimmy Dickens]]. He cut many [[novelty songs]] and boogie-woogie records. The persona in his records was happy-go-lucky and well suited to [[hillbilly music]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Greg|title=Boogie Woogie Fever: Gene O'Quin|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/boogie-woogie-fever-r462277|publisher=All Music|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> Although he did not record any [[rockabilly]] songs in his career, rockabilly enthusiasts have embraced him. His career was eclipsed with the advent of [[rock and roll]] but he did not successfully make the transition as rockabilly artists did.

O'Quin died when his car was hit by a bus in [[Riverside, California]] on November 27, 1978.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/62911927/ Services set for singer], November 29, 1978, [[The San Bernardino Sun]].</ref>
