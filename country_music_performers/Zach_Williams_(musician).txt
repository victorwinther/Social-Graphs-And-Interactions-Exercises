The band took their name from the desire to reform or revitalize the southern rock sound. The band released two independent albums, ''Electric Revival'' in 2009 and ''A Southern Offering'' in 2011. In 2012, Williams disbanded the Reformation due to his newfound Christian beliefs.

===The Brothers of Grace / Zach Williams and the Brothers of Grace===
After Zach Williams and the Reformation disbanded, Williams and guitarist Robby Rigsbee dedicated their lives to Christ and began playing music in their church. Church band the Brothers of Grace became Zach Williams and the Brothers of Grace. Shaun Kirby, who had previously been part of southern rock band Further Down with Rigsbee, was the drummer. The group also included Bruce Ford (bass) and Kevin Rouse (keyboard). They independently released an EP, "Shine a Light", in 2014.
