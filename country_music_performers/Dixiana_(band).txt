'''Dixiana''' was an American [[country music]] band. Founded in 1986, the band was composed of five members: brothers Mark ([[bass guitar]], vocals) and Phil Lister ([[guitar]], vocals), Randall Griffith ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Colonel Shuford ([[Drum kit|drums]]), and Cindy Murphy ([[lead vocals]]).<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p30153|pure_url=yes}} |title=Dixiana biography |accessdate=2008-05-02 |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

Signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1992, they released their self-titled debut album that year.<ref name="ew">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,350326,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221025458/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,350326,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 21, 2009 |title=Dixiana review |accessdate=2008-05-02  |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=1992-06-26}}</ref> It produced three singles, two of which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. The album received a C− rating from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', who described it as "generic country-pop" but highlighted lead vocalist Murphy as a "strong suit".<ref name="ew"/> A fourth single, "Now You're Talkin'", was released in 1993. Joseph Stanley of ''[[Cash Box]]'' praised it as a "fresh and fun cut".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Joseph|date=April 17, 1993|title=Reviews|journal=Cash Box|page=20|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/90s/1993/CB-1993-04-17.pdf}}</ref>

Mark and Phil Lister have since co-founded a recording studio called Dixiana Music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dixiana.com/Associates.htm |title=Our Associates |accessdate=2008-05-02 |work=Dixiana Music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509150249/http://www.dixiana.com/Associates.htm |archive-date=2008-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
