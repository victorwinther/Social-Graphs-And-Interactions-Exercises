'''Ralph Edmund Stanley''' (February 25, 1927 – June 23, 2016) was an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artist, known for his distinctive singing and [[banjo]] playing. He began playing music in 1946, originally with his older brother [[Carter Stanley]] as part of [[The Stanley Brothers]], and most often as the leader of his band, '''The Clinch Mountain Boys'''. Ralph was also known as '''Dr. Ralph Stanley'''.

He was part of the first generation of [[bluegrass music]]ians and was inducted into both the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]].

==Biography==
[[File:Ralph Stanley - Ralph Stanley II - Ron Baker 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Stanley and son Ralph II in 2008]]
Stanley was born, grew up, and lived in rural [[Southwest Virginia]]—"in a little town called [[McClure, Virginia|McClure]] at a place called Big Spraddle Creek, just up the holler" from where he moved in 1936. Before that he lived in another part of [[Dickenson County]].<ref name="virginia-living55">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 55.</ref> The son of Lee and Lucy Smith Stanley, Ralph did not grow up around a lot of music in his home.  As he said, his "daddy didn't play an instrument, but sometimes he would sing church music... I'd hear him sing songs like '[[Man of Constant Sorrow]],' '[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]' and '[[Omie Wise]].'"<ref name="virginia-living55"/>

{{blockquote|I got my first banjo when I was a teenager.  I guess I was 15, 16 years old.  My aunt had this old banjo, and Mother bought it for me ... paid $5 for it, which back then was probably like $5,000.  [My parents] had a little store, and I remember my aunt took it out in groceries.<ref name="virginia-living55"/>}}

He learned to play the [[banjo]], [[clawhammer]] style, from his mother:

{{blockquote|She had 11 brothers and sisters, and all of them could play the five-string banjo.  She played gatherings around the neighborhood, like bean stringin's. She tuned it up for me and played this tune, "Shout Little Luly," and I tried to play it like she did.  But I think I developed my own style of the banjo.<ref name="virginia-living55"/>}}

He graduated from high school on May 2, 1945, and was inducted into the [[United States Army|Army]] on May 16, serving for "little more than a year." When he got home he immediately began performing:

{{blockquote|... my daddy and Carter picked me up from the (station), and Carter was playing with another group, Roy Sykes and the Blue Ridge Mountain Boys, and they had a personal appearance that night.  So I sung a song with Carter on the radio before I even got home.<ref name="virginia-living56">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56.</ref>}}

===Clinch Mountain Boys===
[[File:Dr. Ralph Stanley Grass Valley CA February 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stanley in 2006]]
After considering a course in "veterinary", he decided instead to join his older guitar-playing brother [[Carter Stanley]] (1925–1966) to form the Clinch Mountain Boys in 1946. Drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area, which included the unique singing style of the [[Primitive Baptist Universalist]] church and the sweet down-home family harmonies of the [[Carter Family]], the two Stanley brothers began playing on local radio stations. They first performed at [[Norton, Virginia]]'s WNVA, but did not stay long there, moving on instead to [[Bristol, Virginia]], and [[WZAP|WCYB]] to start the show ''Farm and Fun Time'', where they stayed "off and on for 12 years".<ref name="virginia-living56"/>

At first they covered "a lot of [[Bill Monroe]] music" (one of the first groups to pick up the new "bluegrass" format).<ref name=trischka>Trischka, Tony, "Ralph Stanley", ''Banjo Song Book'', Oak Publications, 1977</ref> They soon "found out that didn't pay off—we needed something of our own. So we started writing songs in 1947, 1948. I guess I wrote 20 or so banjo tunes, but Carter was a better writer than me."<ref name="virginia-living56"/> When [[Columbia Records]] signed them as The Stanley Brothers, Monroe left in protest joining [[Decca Records]]. Later, Carter went back to sing for the "Father of Bluegrass", Monroe.

Ralph Stanley gave his opinion on Bill Monroe's apparent change of heart: "He [Monroe] knew Carter would make him a good singer... Bill Monroe loved our music and loved our singing."<ref name="virginia-living56"/>

The Stanley Brothers joined [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in the late '50s, a record company which was so eclectic that it included [[James Brown]] at the time. In fact, James Brown and his band were in the studio when the Stanley Brothers recorded "[[Finger Poppin' Time]]". "James and his band were poppin' their fingers on that" according to Ralph.<ref name="virginia-living56"/>  At King Records, they "went to a more 'Stanley style', the sound that people most know today."<ref name="virginia-living56"/>

Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo act after Carter's death, from 1967 until his death in 2016.

===Solo===
After Carter died of complications of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for "a year or so",<ref name="virginia-living56"/> Ralph Stanley faced a hard decision on whether to continue performing on his own. "I was worried, I didn't know if I could do it by myself. But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of 'em, and phone calls... I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted me to go on, and he said, 'Hell yes! You might be better than both of them.'"<ref name="virginia-living567">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56-7.</ref>

He decided to go it alone, eventually reviving The Clinch Mountain Boys. [[Larry Sparks]], Roy Lee Centers, and Charlie Sizemore were among those with whom he played in the revived band. He encountered [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Keith Whitley]] arriving late to his own show, "They were about 16 or 17, and they were holding the crowd 'til we got there... They sounded just exactly like (the Stanley Brothers)."<ref name="virginia-living57">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 57.</ref> Seeing their potential, he hired them "to give 'em a chance", though that meant a seven-member band.<ref name="virginia-living56"/> Eventually, his son, Ralph Stanley II, took over as lead singer and rhythm guitarist for The Clinch Mountain Boys.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |title=Ralph Stanley II.|website=Ralphstanleyii.com |access-date=September 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005927/http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His grandson Nathan Stanley became the last lead singer and band leader for The Clinch Mountain Boys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

===Political career===
About 1970, Ralph Stanley ran for Clerk of Court and Commissioner of Revenue in [[Dickenson County, Virginia|Dickenson County]] and said:

{{blockquote|What happened is, somebody traded me off—[[dummy candidate|they used my popularity and money to elect somebody else]].  I was done dirty.  And I'm so proud that I was done dirty, because if I had been elected ... I woulda had a job to do ... maybe woulda finally quit.  So that's one time I was done dirty and I want to thank them for it now.<ref name="virginia-living57"/>}}

===''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''===
Stanley's work was featured in the very popular 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', in which he sings the Appalachian dirge "[[O Death]]". The soundtrack's producer was [[T-Bone Burnett]]. Stanley said the following about working with Burnett:

{{blockquote|T-Bone Burnett had several auditions for that song.  He wanted it in the [[Dock Boggs]] style.  So I got my banjo and learned it the way he did it.  You see, I had recorded "O Death" three times, done it with Carter. So I went down with my banjo to Nashville and I said, "T-Bone, let me sing it the way I want to sing it," and I laid my banjo down and sung it [[a cappella]].  After two or three verses, he stopped me and said, "That's it."<ref name="virginia-living57"/>}}

With that song, Stanley won a [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002 Grammy Award]] in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Male Country Vocal Performance]]. "That put the icing on the cake for me," he said. "It put me in a different category."<ref name="virginia-living57"/>

===Later life===
He was known in the world of [[bluegrass music]] by the popular title, "Dr. Ralph Stanley", having been awarded an honorary doctorate in music from [[Lincoln Memorial University]]<ref name= "CW Farewell">{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Jon|title=Dr. Ralph Stanley Announces Farewell Tour |url= http://www.countryweekly.com/news/dr-ralph-stanley-announces-farewell-tour|work=Country Weekly|date= June 26, 2013 |access-date= August 8, 2017| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131008201630/http://www.countryweekly.com/news/dr-ralph-stanley-announces-farewell-tour| archive-date= October 8, 2013}}</ref> of [[Harrogate, Tennessee]] in 1976.

On November 10, 2007, Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys performed at a rally for presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], just before the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s annual [[Jefferson-Jackson Day]] Dinner. Between renditions of "[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]" and "[[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]]", Stanley told the crowd that he had cast his first vote for [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1948 and would cast his next for John Edwards in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} In October 2008,  he performed in a radio advertisement for [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Davis |first=Susan |date=October 2, 2008 |title=Bluegrass Legend Cuts Radio Ad for Obama in Va. |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WB-6245 |access-date=March 9, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=2008-10-03 |title=Bluegrass Legend Ralph Stanley Endorses Obama: "We Need a Change" |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/bluegrass-legend-ralph-stanley-endorses-obama-we-need-a-change-96834/ |access-date=2023-03-09 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>

Stanley maintained an active touring schedule; appearances in his later years included the 2012 [[Muddy Roots]] Music Festival in [[Cookeville, Tennessee]] and the 2013 FreshGrass Festival in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]]. In June 2013, he announced a farewell tour,<ref name= "BG final">{{cite web|url= http://bluegrasstoday.com/ralph-stanley-announces-his-final-tour/ |title= Ralph Stanley announces his final tour |work= Bluegrass Today | first= John| last= Lawless|date= June 26, 2013| access-date= August 8, 2017| url-status= live| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131019113806/https://bluegrasstoday.com/ralph-stanley-announces-his-final-tour/| archive-date= October 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name= "CW Farewell" /> scheduled to begin in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina]] on October 18 and extending to December 2014.

==Musical style==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Stanley created a unique style of [[banjo]] playing, sometimes called "Stanley style". It evolved from the [[Wade Mainer]] style two-finger technique and was later influenced by the [[Scruggs style]], which is a three-finger technique. "Stanley style" is distinguished by incredibly fast "forward rolls", led by the index finger (instead of the thumb, as in Scruggs style), sometimes in the higher registers using a [[Capo (musical device)|capo]]. In "Stanley style", the rolls of the banjo are continuous, while being picked fairly close to the bridge on the banjo, giving the tone of the instrument a very crisp, articulate snap to the strings as the player plays them.
