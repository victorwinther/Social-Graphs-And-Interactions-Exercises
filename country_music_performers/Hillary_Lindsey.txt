She signed her first publishing deal in 1997.<ref name=":2" /> She was later signed as an artist to [[Sony Music]] but was dropped by the label after three months.<ref name=":1" />

She tells the story{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} of a roommate who had an internship at a record label and took one of her tapes into work with her. The tape was passed around to publishers, and Lindsey was quickly signed to [[Famous Music Publishing]]. In her first year as a writer she had eight cuts. She had her first number one song as a writer in 2002 with [[Martina McBride]]'s "[[Blessed (Martina McBride song)|Blessed]]". In that same year, her song ''This Mystery'' (co-written by [[Troy Verges]] and [[Brett James]]) was a number one hit in the Netherlands for singer Marco Borsato in a Dutch translation titled ''Lopen op het Water'' ("Walking on water"). The Dutch translation was recorded for the marriage of then-crown prince [[Willem Alexander]] and [[Queen Máxima of the Netherlands|Maxima Zorreguieta]].

Eleven of her number ones as a writer are [[Carrie Underwood]] tracks including "[[Jesus, Take the Wheel|Jesus Take The Wheel]]", [[Wasted (Carrie Underwood song)|"Wasted"]], "[[So Small]]", [[Just a Dream (Carrie Underwood song)|"Just A Dream"]], "[[Last Name (song)|Last Name]]" and "[[Two Black Cadillacs]]". Thirty million records have been sold featuring her compositions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} She has had two songs featured on the ABC television series ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'': "[[Telescope (song)|Telescope]]" performed by [[Hayden Panettiere]] and "Change Your Mind" performed by [[Clare Bowen]] and [[Sam Palladio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.durango-songwriters-expo.com/hit-songwriter-bios-hillary-lindsey.html|title=Hit Songwriter Bios -- Hillary Lindsey|work=Durango Songwriters Expo|access-date=September 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210051142/http://www.durango-songwriters-expo.com/hit-songwriter-bios-hillary-lindsey.html|archive-date=February 10, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesongsurvives.com/2013/01/a-conversation-with-hillary-lindsey/|title=A Conversation With Hillary Lindsey|work=thesongsurvives.com|access-date=September 5, 2015}}</ref>
