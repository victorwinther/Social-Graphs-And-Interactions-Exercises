'''Brother Phelps''' was an American [[country music]] duo formed by brothers Ricky Lee ([[guitar]], [[vocals]]) and Doug Phelps ([[bass guitar]], vocals). Prior to the duo's formation in 1992, both brothers were members of [[The Kentucky Headhunters]], a [[Southern rock]]-influenced [[country rock]] band. In 1993, Brother Phelps charted with its debut single "[[Let Go (Brother Phelps song)|Let Go]]", which reached a peak of No.&nbsp;6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts. In all, the duo charted six singles between 1993 and 1995 (although only one other single reached Top 40), in addition to recording two albums on [[Asylum Records]]. Brother Phelps disbanded in 1995, with Doug rejoining the Kentucky Headhunters as lead singer, and Ricky Lee assuming a solo career.

After the band's second album, 1991's ''[[Electric Barnyard]]'', failed to produce a major hit, Ricky Lee and Doug announced that they were leaving to form their own group.<ref name="cst"/> Mark Orr then became lead singer of The Kentucky Headhunters, while Anthony Kenney took over as bass guitarist.

The newly formed duo (named Brother Phelps, after Ricky Lee and Doug's minister father),<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p43298/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Brother Phelps > Biography ))) |accessdate=2007-07-21 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=Allmusic}}</ref> signed to [[Asylum Records]] in 1992.

Cale]] cover), was released in 1995 to critical acclaim, although it failed to produce any Top 40 singles.<ref name="oldies"/><ref name="allmusic"/> The duo disbanded in 1995, with Doug returning to the Kentucky Headhunters, assuming the role of lead vocalist after Orr's departure.<ref name="cst"/> Ricky Lee, meanwhile, continued to record as a solo artist.
