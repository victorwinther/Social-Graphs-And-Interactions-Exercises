== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Early in his career, Tim Hicks used his love for music and a desire to learn as a way to hone his talent. He built a loyal and dedicated fan base in his home town of Niagara Falls by frequently playing at the local pubs and wineries. This is what led to him being discovered by [[Open Road Recordings]].<ref name="Tim Hicks" />

=== Record deal and ''Throw Down''===
In 2011, Hicks signed a deal with his record label Open Road Recordings.<ref name="Tim Hicks" /> Since then he has been consistently writing songs and releasing music.

After he signed with Open Road Recordings, Tim had the chance to open for [[Dallas Smith (singer)|Dallas Smith]] and [[Chad Brownlee]] on the Boys of Fall tour in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tim Hicks's Concert & Tour History {{!}} Concert Archives|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/tim-hicks|access-date=2020-07-18|website=concertarchives.org}}</ref>

In 2013, Hicks released his debut album ''Throw Down,'' which featured his debut single "Get By" that has since been certified Platinum.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-02-06|title=Tim Hicks' Debut Single 'Get By' Goes Platinum|url=https://topcountry.ca/tim-hicks-debut-single-get-goes-platinum/|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Top Country|language=en-US}}</ref> "Get By" landed in the Top 10 at Country Radio in less than 8 weeks and became his first Gold single.
