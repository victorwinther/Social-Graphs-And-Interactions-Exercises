==Early life==
Schneider was born on April 8, 1960, in [[Mount Kisco, New York]], the youngest of three boys of Shirley (Frasier) [Schneider] Conklin (1932–2016) and John "Jack" Richard Schneider III (1930–2013), a pilot who had served in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/john-schneider/bio/158293/|title=John Schneider|magazine=TV Guide|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hudsonvalleyfuneralhomes.com/memsol.cgi?user_id=1164936|title=Obituary for John Schneider III – MILLBROOK, NY|website=Hudsonvalleyfuneralhomes.com|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> His mother is from [[Sanford, Florida]].<ref name="Sanford">{{cite web |url=https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/movies_tv/article_596f29d4-7814-5d5c-b35c-ad3ac7e606fc.htm |title=Take a tour of John Schneider's flooded Louisiana home |date=August 19, 2016 |access-date=December 9, 2021 |quote=John Schneider: 'Two and half feet up, everything in there, every closet, every drawer, great pictures of when Mom was a girl in Sanford, Florida.'}}</ref> His family included an older brother Robert, an artist living in southern New York. His other brother (also called John) died of lung failure age three, three years before John's birth. John's life as an entertainer began at the age of eight, when he put on magic shows for his peers and their families. This once got him into trouble, when he had himself chained up and tossed into a swimming pool with the intention of re-creating [[Harry Houdini]]'s legendary escape act. When he was 14, he and his mother moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where his love for performing continued. He went to [[North Springs High School]] in [[Sandy Springs, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mdjonline.com/neighbor_newspapers/schneider-returns-to-north-springs/collection_b8a22354-c917-11e6-88b4-9f1a9b517338.html|title=Schneider returns to North Springs|website=MDJOnline.com|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
===Acting ===
[[file:John Schneider and Reagans at 1982 Christmas in Washington.jpg|right|thumb|Schneider with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] during a taping of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Christmas in Washington]]'' special in 1982.]]

At the age of 18, he won the role of [[Bo Duke]], working alongside another newcomer [[Tom Wopat]] and veteran actor [[James Best]]. For his audition, he "borrowed a dilapidated pickup truck, put on a big ol' country accent and funky hat. I hadn't shaved and went in toting a beer. I don't know whether they believed it or not, but they liked it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/his-dukes-days-over-ex-hayseed-john-schneider-moves-out-of-hazzard-county-into-country-music-vol-23-no-17|title=His ''Dukes'' Days Over Ex Hayseed John Schneider Moves Out of Hazzard County into Country Music|publisher=People|date=October 21, 1985 |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref> Schneider learned to drive the iconic Dodge Charger in the show, but to the disappointment of many fans, he admitted he never jumped the car due to the dangerous nature of the stunt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/05/29/john-schneider-lied-about-southern-roots-driving-skills-to-land-role-bo-duke.html|title=John Schneider lied about Southern roots, driving skills to land role of Bo Duke|publisher=FoxNews.com|date=May 29, 2014 |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref>

At the height of the series' popularity, he also became a recording artist and a face of merchandise. In 1982, a tangle of legal suits with the producers over the distribution of merchandising royalties caused Schneider and co-star Tom Wopat to leave the show for most of a season. They returned to their roles in February 1983 only after their claims were satisfied. The show was canceled in 1985, after seven seasons. Schneider directed the series finale, titled "Opening Night at the Boar's Nest," airing originally on CBS, February 8, 1985.

In 2001, he portrayed [[Jonathan "Pa" Kent|Jonathan Kent]], the adoptive father of [[Clark Kent]] on ''[[Smallville]]'', starring in 100 episodes. Schneider directed some episodes of ''Smallville'', including "Talisman". Some episodes contain references to Schneider's work in ''The Dukes of Hazzard'', e.g. the season five episode "Exposed" is notable for reuniting Schneider with his former ''Dukes'' co-star Tom Wopat. Schneider guest starred for the latter half of season five appearing in the episodes "Void" and "Oracle". Schneider returned for the season 10 premiere of ''Smallville'', reprising his role as Jonathan Kent in a recurring role.<ref>[https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/30/smallville-an-original-cast-member-returns?amp=1 "''Smallville'': An Original Cast Member Returns"] by Eric Goldman, [[IGN]], June 30, 2010; accessed February 26, 2014.</ref>

Schneider has appeared in many films and TV series, including five guest spots on ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and the [[miniseries]] ''[[10.5 (miniseries)|10.5]]''. He had a recurring role on ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' and made guest appearances on such shows as ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' and ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]''.

In 2009, Schneider made an appearance on ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' in an episode titled "Kill Me If You Can". He appeared in the first season of ''[[The Secret Life of the American Teenager]]'', in which his real-life son Chasen Schneider had a recurring role. During the summer of 2008 and early 2009, John portrayed "Marshall Bowman". He declined to continue through the second season and his character was written off.

In 2010, Schneider appeared in the series ''[[Leverage (American TV series)|Leverage]]'' as a corrupt music executive in the season three episode "The Studio Job", and in several episodes of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as a retired military man and father of Keith Watson ([[Brian Austin Green]]), the love interest of [[Bree Van de Kamp]].

In 2011, he starred in the film ''Doonby'', as a drifter who comes into a small town and makes it better. However, a menacing force stalks him. "It's ''It's a Wonderful Life'' without the wonderful part," Schneider explains. "'Reach down into the throat of ''It's a Wonderful Life'', pull it inside out and make a movie out of it."<ref>[http://www.worldmag.com/articles/17126 Hold the saccharine: The Christians behind Doonby hope it will be a different kind of 'faith-based film'], Rebecca Cusey, [[World Magazine]] Issue: ''Broken beyond repair?''

===Music===
[[File:John Schneider Mirande Country Music Festival Midi-Pyrenees FRANCE July 2008.jpg|thumb|Schneider performing in 2008]]
During Schneider's ''Dukes of Hazzard'' days, he also entered into music. In the early 80s Schneider signed with Scotti Brothers Label and released his debut full-length album, ''Now or Never'', which peaked at No. 8 on the US Country Billboard charts. The single "It's Now or Never," a remake of the Elvis Presley hit, peaked at number 4 on the US Country Billboard charts and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1981 and is one of the highest charting Elvis covers of all time.

Schneider continued to release albums, including ''Quiet Man'' and ''If You Believe'', and, in 1984, signed with MCA Nashville. Through MCA Nashville, Schneider released ''Too Good to Stop Now'' which included his first No. 1 hits, "I've Been Around Enough to Know" and "Country Girls," peaking at No. 1 on the CAN Country music charts. In 1985, Schneider unleashed ''Tryin' To Outrun the Wind'', followed by ''A Memory Like You'' which debuted at No. 1 on the US Country Billboard charts, a first for Schneider.

The album ''A Memory Like You'' featured "What's a Memory Like You (Doing In A Love Like This)" and "You're The Last Thing I Needed Tonight," singles which both peaked at No. 1 on the US Country Billboard charts and CAN Country. In the late 80s, Schneider continued releasing albums including his Greatest Hits record. Taking some time off to pursue acting opportunities, Schneider returned with ''Worth The Wait'', ''John's Acoustic Christmas'', ''The Promise'' and ''Home For Christmas'', with ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' co-star Tom Wopat in 2014.

In 2019, on January 29, LIVE, at a filming of the TV show "Good Rockin' Tonight," John Schneider was Inducted on the air into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
"I hadn't done music since 1990. People responded to that music, and one thing led to another," shares Schneider. "It's funny. Even though I had a bunch of No. 1 songs, people say, 'Oh, I love that Dukes of Hazzard song you sang!' Well, I didn't sing it, Waylon Jennings sang it. I'm famous for music by a song I never sang. Crazy."

In November 2021, Schneider spoke and performed at Global Vision Bible Church in Wilson County, Tennessee.

On June 12, 2018, Schneider spoke to [[Fox News]] regarding his upcoming three-day jail sentence for failing to pay [[alimony]] to his estranged wife Elvira Castle. He said he has had hard financial times and he has spent his money on repairing his studio in [[Louisiana]] which was destroyed in an [[2016 Louisiana floods|August 2016 flood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/celebrity/john-schneider-speaks-out-before-heading-to-jail-im-disheartened-with-the-system-but-my-heads-up/ar-AAyxObQ?li=BBnb7Kz |title=John Schneider speaks out before heading to jail: 'I'm disheartened with the system but my head's up' |website=[[MSN]] |access-date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232650/http://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/celebrity/john-schneider-speaks-out-before-heading-to-jail-im-disheartened-with-the-system-but-my-heads-up/ar-AAyxObQ?li=BBnb7Kz |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was arrested at 10:29 AM and released at 3:45 PM. The short imprisonment was due to the overcrowded prison. He contrasted the warm treatment of the corrections officers to the "[[presumption of guilt|guilty until proven innocent]]" treatment he received in the court system. However, he was still ordered to perform 240 hours of [[community service]] and pay the debt to Elvira, or else face an imprisonment of five years.<ref>{{cite news |title=That Was Easy!!! 3 Days in Jail Over in Hours |url=https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/12/john-schneider-released-jail-sentence-spousal-support/ |access-date=2 July 2018 |website=TMZ|date=12 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/tv/john-schneider-divorce-requests-jail-time-alimony/|title=Dukes of Hazzard's John Schneider Requests Jail Time Because He Can't Afford Alimony: 'I'm Leveraged to the Max'|website=People|access-date=November 7, 2019}}</ref>
