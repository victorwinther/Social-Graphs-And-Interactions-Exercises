'''Mudcrutch''' was an American musical group from [[Gainesville, Florida]], whose sound touched on [[Southern rock|southern rock]] and [[country rock]]. They were first active in the 1970s and reformed in 2007, and are best known for being the band which launched [[Tom Petty]] to fame.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mudcrutch-mw0000783357 | title=Mudcrutch - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/2-mw0002938002 | title=2 - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref>

Mudcrutch formed in Gainesville in 1970 and soon became a popular act across Florida. The band moved to Los Angeles in 1974 to attract the attention of a record company. Though they signed a contract with [[Shelter Records]], they released only one poor-selling single before breaking up in 1975. The following year, former Mudcrutch members Petty, [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], and [[Benmont Tench]] formed the core of a new band, the Heartbreakers.

Most of the original Mudcrutch lineup reformed in 2007 to record their first album as a group, which was followed by a tour. A second album followed in 2016. Petty's death in 2017 effectively dissolved the group; Leadon died in 2023.

== History ==
=== 1970–1975 ===
Mudcrutch was formed in 1970 by [[Gainesville, Florida]], residents [[Tom Petty]] and [[Tom Leadon]] (brother of [[Bernie Leadon]] from [[The Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]), then teenagers, who had been playing together in a group called the Epics. Mudcrutch's lineup consisted of Petty (bass and vocals), Leadon (guitar and vocals), Jim Lenahan (vocals), Randall Marsh (drums) and [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] (guitar). Lenahan was initially the band's lead vocalist, but Petty very quickly also started singing lead on some songs.  

This incarnation of Mudcrutch issued a locally distributed single ("Up In Mississippi"/"Cause Is Understood") in 1971, with Petty writing and singing both songs. Leadon and Lenehan left the band in 1972 and were replaced by bassist/guitarist/vocalist Danny Roberts and keyboardist [[Benmont Tench]]. Ricky Rucker was a part of the band for a short time. Mudcrutch became locally popular and regularly played gigs from central Florida to southern Georgia. In Gainesville, they had a long stint as the house band at Dub's Lounge and organized several well-attended music festivals at "Mudcrutch Farm", a run-down house on a large lot where several band members lived.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Reinink|url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20080608/whats-left-of-the-mudcrutch-farm |title=What's left of the Mudcrutch Farm?  |website=Gainesville.com |access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref>

In 1974, the members of Mudcrutch decided to relocate to [[Los Angeles]] to try to sign with a major record label. After several rejections, they signed with [[Leon Russell]]'s independent [[Shelter Records]]. The band released one single, "Depot Street" in 1975, which failed to chart. After Danny Roberts left the group, Petty invited [[Charlie Souza]] to take over on bass guitar and the band continued recording in Leon Russell's [[The Church Studio|Tulsa studio]], and later at his [[Encino, California]], home. Discouraged by the group's lack of success, the record company broke up Mudcrutch in late 1975, keeping only Petty under contract. Several months later, Petty regrouped with former Mudcrutch members Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench to form [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|the Heartbreakers]] along with fellow Gainesville natives [[Stan Lynch]] (drums) and [[Ron Blair]] (bass).<ref>DeYoung, Bill. "Tom Petty: Full Steam Ahead" ''Goldmine'' July 13, 1990: 18–30</ref>

=== Reformation: 2007–2017 ===
In August 2007, Tom Petty invited Randall Marsh and Tom Leadon, original members of Mudcrutch, to reunite with Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell to reform Mudcrutch. They recorded an album, ''[[Mudcrutch (album)|Mudcrutch]]'', which was released on April 29, 2008, by [[Reprise Records]], and contains 14 old and new tracks. "We would play and then we would just talk about the old days," said Leadon. The band toured briefly in California to promote the album throughout April and the beginning of May 2008. The album hit number 8 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/311924/mudcrutch/chart |title=Mudcrutch – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref>

Fans who bought tickets to the tour through [[Ticketmaster]] were given six free downloads from the album.

On November 11, 2008, a live EP titled ''[[Extended Play Live]]'' was released. All tracks were recorded live in April 2008. On the same day American music channel [[VH1 Classic]] broadcast a documentary about the band.

According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mudcrutch intended to reconvene August 2015 to begin work on a new album. The group was originally going to begin work on the album in January of that year, but things were pushed back eight months due to medical issues that rhythm guitarist Tom Leadon was experiencing.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Tom Petty's Pre-Fame Band Mudcrutch to Record New Album|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-pettys-pre-fame-band-mudcrutch-to-record-new-lp-20150602|magazine = Rolling Stone|access-date = October 9, 2015}}</ref> In February 2016, prior to the announcement that they were releasing a second album, Mudcrutch was announced as a headliner for both the 2016 Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the 2016 Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, Illinois.

The band's second full-length album, ''2'', was released May 20, 2016, on Reprise Records. Preceding the album's release was a single, "Trailer", as well as "Beautiful World" and "Hungry No More". The album hit number 10 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name="billboard1" /> Less than three days after the album was released, the band embarked on their first national tour in support of the album. The tour began the same way their 2008 tour did: with two benefit shows for the Midnight Mission (on May 23 and 24, 2016, in Los Angeles). [[Herb Pedersen]], who is also credited on ''2'', joined Mudcrutch on the tour.

Petty died on October 2, 2017, of [[cardiac arrest]], while Leadon died on March 22, 2023, of natural causes.<ref>[https://wbsm.com/ixp/295/p/tom-leadon-dead/ Tom Leadon, Mudcrutch Co-Founder, Dead at 70]</ref> Both deaths effectively ended the possibility of any further Mudcrutch activity.
