'''Sam Morgan''' (born July 28, 1982), professionally known as '''Sam Outlaw''', is a country music singer-songwriter and producer. Outlaw calls his music "SoCal country", country music refashioned with a Southern California vibe of the classic honky-tonk and troubadour pop.<ref name="Shore Fire">{{cite web|title=Introducing a Country Singer Living in Los Angeles|url=http://shorefire.com/releases/entry/introducing-a-country-singer-living-in-los-angeles-sam-outlaw-new-lp-angele|website=Shore Fire Media|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>

==Early life==
Outlaw was born in [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]] as Sam Morgan.<ref name="Lonesome Highway">{{cite web|last1=Rapid|first1=Stephen|title=Interview With Sam Outlaw By Stephen Rapid|url=http://www.lonesomehighway.com/interviews/2014/2/17/interview-with-sam-outlaw-by-stephen-rapid.html|website=Lonesome Highway|date=February 17, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> At the age of 10, his family moved to southern California. He grew up in a conservative Christian home and was limited by his parents as to what kind of music he could listen to. He did however, note the influence of Western Swing band [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and how their all-star tribute albums to [[Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys]] acted as "country music in a bottle" for him. [[The Beatles]] were also a huge influence on Outlaw. As a young adult, he had a musical revelation when he heard the classic country voices of [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[George Jones]]. Outlaw notes that George Jones' music inspired him to get more serious about playing the guitar and writing songs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Exclusive Video Premiere: "Ghost Town" by Sam Outlaw|url = http://thedailysouth.southernliving.com/2015/07/07/exclusive-video-premiere-ghost-town-by-sam-outlaw/|website = The Daily South|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref>

In "his late 20s ... both his parents’ and his own marriage simultaneously crumbled."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/sam-outlaw-is-on-a-mission-to-make-country-music-that-doesn-t-suck-6868319 |title = Sam Outlaw is on a Mission to Make "Country Music That Doesn't Suck"|date = 2016-04-27}}</ref>

When Outlaw decided to actively pursue a music career, he borrowed his mother's maiden name, Outlaw, for a stage moniker. His mother has since died and he honors her by continuing to use the family name.<ref name="Shore Fire" />

==Career==
Sam Outlaw had a successful advertising career in Southern California; however, on his thirtieth birthday he switched gears to pursue his passion for music. Outlaw self-released an EP in 2014. It immediately created a buzz and he secured performance slots at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] and AmericanaFest produced by the [[Americana Music Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sam Outlaw Spreads SoCal Country Sound With 'Angeleno'|url = http://theboot.com/sam-outlaw-angeleno-interview-2015/|website = The Boot|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref>

CMT featured his music video, ''Cry For Me'', in 2014.

While enlisting a crack group of backing musicians to record ''Angeleno'', Outlaw's first LP, he began working with musician and record producer, [[Ry Cooder]]. Outlaw wrote all of the songs on ''Angeleno''. Ry Cooder and his son, drummer [[Joachim Cooder]], co-produced and played on the album. Other musicians on the album include [[Bo Koster]], [[Taylor Goldsmith]], [[Gabe Witcher]] and vocalist [[Arnold McCuller]].<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite magazine|title=Listen to Sam Outlaw and Ry Cooder Redefine California Country|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/listen-to-sam-outlaw-and-ry-cooder-redefine-california-country-20150310|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=March 10, 2015|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>

On May 3, 2019 – the same night he made his debut on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] – Outlaw released an EP called ''Hat Acts''.  At the time of its release, he wrote on his website: “I wanted to do something different with this album.  ''Hat Acts'' is inspired by honky tonk scenes, hip-hop skits and of course – real life. This is a bit of a ‘concept album’ and I had a lot of fun putting it together.”<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite web |last1=Hudak |first1=Joseph |title=Sam Outlaw Mixes Surreal Vignettes With Honky-Tonk Music on New EP |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/sam-outlaw-shake-a-heartache-country-song-830973/ |website=RollingStone.com |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=9 December 2019|date=2019-05-03 }}</ref> Later that summer, he released a duet with [[Sarah Darling]] called "Forever & Always" across streaming platforms and was also a radio single in the United Kingdom.
