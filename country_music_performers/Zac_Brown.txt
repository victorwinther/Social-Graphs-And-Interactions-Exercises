==Early life==
Brown was raised on [[Lake Lanier]], Georgia by his mother, Bettye, and stepfather Dr. Jody Moses, a dentist in [[Cumming, Georgia]]. The eleventh of twelve children, Brown attended Mashburn Elementary School in Cumming; [[Lakeview Academy]] in [[Gainesville, Georgia]]; and [[South Forsyth High School]] in Cumming. At age he moved to [[Dahlonega, Georgia]] where he graduated from [[Lumpkin County High School]]. Brown was given his mother's guitar at age 8, and one of his stepfather's patients was enlisted to teach him classical guitar. He completed two years of lessons, but soon after developed a love for [[bluegrass music]] while playing with his father and brother on weekend visits. In his mid-teens, Brown spent almost a year being tutored by a vocal coach from his church.

While still in high school, with [[James Taylor]] as his inspiration, Brown began playing solo gigs in local venues, performing country and pop [[cover version|cover]] songs. Brown attended the [[University of West Georgia]], where he became a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Order]] fraternity.
