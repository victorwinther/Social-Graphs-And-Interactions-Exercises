In 1961, [[Arthur Godfrey]] invited them on his show, giving the duo their big break. They landed a record deal with [[Columbia Records]] and released their debut album ''The Kooky World of the Geezinslaw Brothers'' in 1963. They moved to [[New York City]] and  changed record labels to [[Capitol Records]], where they recorded four more albums between 1966 and 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonestarmusic.com/?id=394|title=Lone Star Music - Order online or call 800.TXMUSIC|website=Lonestarmusic.com}}</ref> The duo made the country Top 100 three times during their stint with Capitol, but never cracked the Top 40.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mp3.com/|title=MP3.com|website=MP3.com}}</ref>

The Geezinslaw Brothers made guest appearances on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]], [[The Jackie Gleason Show]] and [[Hootenanny (U.S. TV series)]] and toured with [[Roger Miller]] and [[Perry Como]]. They became regulars on [[Ralph Emery|Ralph Emery's]] radio program ''[[Pop! Goes the Country]]''. In 1986, they appeared on ''[[Nashville Now]]'', another show hosted by Ralph Emery.<ref name="Sam Allred fired from KVET"/> They also made guest appearances on ''The Jimmy Dean Show'', an hour-long country variety show.

The Geezinslaw Brothers released only one album each decade in the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1989, the band, now calling themselves just the Geezinslaws, released a self-titled album on the Step One label.

In 1993, the group received the National Association of Record Merchandisers "Indie Best Seller Award" for their recording, ''Feelin' Good, Gittin' Up, Gittin' Down''. This album also gave them their first chart single in over two decades with "Help, I’m White and I Can't Get Down."

The group appeared on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' three times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=10&Itemid=76|title=Austin City Limits - ANTHOLOGY|website=Pbs.org}}</ref> The Austin Music Awards inducted the Geezinslaws into its Hall of Fame for 2005.
