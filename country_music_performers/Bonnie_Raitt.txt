'''Bonnie Lynn Raitt''' ({{IPAc-en|r|eɪ|t}};<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/organization/standards-guidelines/qrst/#r|title=Say How: R|publisher=National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled|access-date=December 31, 2020}}</ref> born November 8, 1949) is an American [[blues rock]] singer, guitarist, and songwriter. In 1971, Raitt released her [[Bonnie Raitt (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Following this, she released a series of critically acclaimed [[Americana (music)|roots]]-influenced albums that incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Country music|country]]. She was also a frequent session player and collaborator with other artists, including [[Warren Zevon]], [[Little Feat]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[the Pointer Sisters]], [[John Prine]], and [[Leon Russell]].

In 1989, after several years of limited commercial success, she had a major hit with her tenth studio album,  ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'', which included the [[Nick of Time (song)|song of the same name]]. The album reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. It has since been selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Recording Registry]]. Her following two albums, ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'' (1991) and ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'' (1994), were multimillion sellers, generating several hit singles, including "[[Something to Talk About (Bonnie Raitt song)|Something to Talk About]]", "[[Love Sneakin' Up On You]]", and the ballad "[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]" (with [[Bruce Hornsby]] on piano). Her 2022 single "[[Just Like That (Bonnie Raitt song)|Just Like That]]" won the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]].

As of 2023, Raitt has received 13 competitive [[Grammy Award]]s, from 30 nominations, as well as a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref name="Grammy2023">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/bonnie-raitt/15857 |title=Artist: Bonnie Raitt |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2023 |website=Grammy.com |publisher=Recording Academy |access-date=February 6, 2023}}</ref> She ranked No. 50 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Singers of All Time]]"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com//music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/bonnie-raitt-20101202|title=100 Greatest Singers|date=November 23, 2011|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-09-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902190252/http://www.rollingstone.com//music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/bonnie-raitt-20101202|archive-date=September 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and ranked No. 89 on the magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/bonnie-raitt-19691231|title=100 Greatest Guitarists|date=November 23, 2011|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=2012-09-01|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718113619/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/bonnie-raitt-19691231|archive-date=July 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Australian country music artist [[Graeme Connors]] has said "Bonnie Raitt does something with a lyric no one else can do; she bends it and twists it right into your heart."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/nsw/stories/s2137964.htm?nsw |title=Summer Conversations January 2008 |author=Chris Coleman |date=January 18, 2008 |publisher=ABC New South Wales.

In 2000, Raitt was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. She has received the [[Billboard Women in Music#Icon Award|Icon Award]] from the [[Billboard Women in Music|Billboard Women in Music Awards]] and the [[MusiCares Person of the Year|MusiCares Person of the Year Award]]  from [[The Recording Academy]].

==Early life==
Bonnie Lynn Raitt was born on November 8, 1949, in [[Burbank, California]].{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=11}} Her mother, Marge Goddard (née Haydock), was a pianist, and her father, [[John Raitt]], was an actor in [[musical theatre|musical]] productions such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and ''[[The Pajama Game]]''.<ref name="Official Website Biography"/> Raitt is of Scottish ancestry; her ancestors constructed [[Rait Castle]] near [[Nairn]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Italie |first1=Hillel |title=Bonnie Raitt discovers her roots |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19910714&id=R1cyAAAAIBAJ&pg=6928,3407930 |access-date=24 December 2016 |work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=14 July 1991|page=4D}}</ref> As a child, Raitt would often play with her two brothers, Steve and David and was a self-described [[tomboy]].{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=10}} John Raitt's job as a theater actor meant Bonnie did not interact with him as much as she would have liked. Raitt grew to resent her mother, as she became the main authority figure of the household whenever John was away.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}}

Raitt's musically inclined parents had a strong influence on her life. From a young age, she and her brothers were encouraged to pursue music.{{sfn|Bego|1995|pp=12–13}} Initially, Raitt played the piano but was intimidated by her mother's abilities.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}} She instead began playing a [[Stella (guitar)|Stella]] guitar, which she received as a Christmas gift in 1957 at the age of eight.<ref name="Official Website Biography"/>{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}} Raitt did not take lessons; she was instead influenced by the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1950s. She was also influenced by the [[beatnik]] movement, stating "It represented my whole belief [...] I'd grow my hair real long so I looked like a beatnik."{{sfn|Bego|1995|pp=13–14}}

From ages eight through fifteen, Raitt and her brothers attended a [[summer camp]] in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] called Camp Regis.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}}{{sfnm|1a1=Schmidt|1a2=Rooney|1y=1979|1p=305}} It was there where Raitt learned of her musical talents, when camp counselors would ask her to play in front of the campers.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=14}} Learning how to play songs from folk albums then became a hobby for Raitt.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=14}} As a teenager, Raitt was self-conscious about her weight and her [[freckle]]s, and saw music as an escape from reality.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=15}} "That was my saving grace. I just sat in my room and played my guitar," said Raitt.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=15}}

After graduating from [[Oakwood Friends School]] in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1967, Raitt entered [[Radcliffe College]] of [[Harvard University]], majoring in [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Social Relations]] and [[African studies]].<ref name="Official Website Biography">{{cite web|url=https://www.bonnieraitt.com/bio|title=Bonnie Raitt Biography|website=Official Bonnie Raitt website|access-date=April 19, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213020807/http://www.bonnieraitt.com/bio|archive-date=February 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She said her "plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President [[Julius Nyerere]] was creating a government based on democracy and socialism".<ref name="oprah">{{cite journal|url=https://www.oprah.com/spirit/bonnie-raitts-aha-moment|title=Bonnie Raitt's Aha!

Raitt said it was an "opportunity that changed everything."<ref name="oprah" />

==Career==
===1970–1976===
In the summer of 1970, she played with her brother David on stand-up bass with [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]] at the [[Philadelphia Folk Festival]] as well as opening for [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond]] at [[the Gaslight Cafe]] in New York. She was seen by a reporter from ''[[Newsweek]]'', who began to spread the word about her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from [[Warner Bros.]], who soon released her debut album, ''[[Bonnie Raitt (album)|Bonnie Raitt]]'', in 1971.<ref name="LarkinBlues">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Blues]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-673-1|page=300}}</ref> The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.

While admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'', was released in 1972 to positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Bonnie Raiit: Give It Up |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/give-it-up-mw0000196849 |website=AllMusic |access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref> One journalist described the album as "an excellent set" and "established the artist as an inventive and sympathetic interpreter".<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> However, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's ''[[Takin' My Time]]'' was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

Raitt began to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', but with 1974's ''[[Streetlights (Bonnie Raitt album)|Streetlights]]'', reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> By this point, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's ''[[Home Plate (album)|Home Plate]]''. In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].

She was influenced by the playing style of [[Lowell George]], of the band [[Little Feat]], particularly his use of a pre-amp [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] with a [[slide guitar]]. [[B.B. King]] once called Raitt the "best damn slide player working today".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/bonnie-raitt-and-the-fugitive-emotions-evoked-by-slide-guitar | title=Bonnie Raitt and the Fugitive Emotions Evoked by Slide Guitar | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=April 9, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bluesguitarinsider.com/blues-guitarists/lowell-george | title=Lowell George | date=August 2013 }}</ref>

===1977–1988===
[[File:Bonnie Raitt2.jpg|thumb|230px|Raitt performing at the [[Berkeley Community Theater]], 1976–1977]]
1977's ''[[Sweet Forgiveness]]'' album gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough,<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> when it yielded a hit single in her remake of [[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|"Runaway".]] Recast as a heavy [[rhythm and blues]] recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by [[Al Green]], Raitt's version of "Runaway" was disparaged by many critics. However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. "There was this big Columbia–Warner war going on at the time", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. "[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia... And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia – no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal."{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=76}}

Warner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, ''[[The Glow (Bonnie Raitt album)|The Glow]]'', in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Raitt had one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five concerts of [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Those shows spawned the three-record gold album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', as well as a Warner Brothers feature film [[No Nukes (film)|of the same name]], and featured co-founders [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], and Raitt as well as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[James Taylor]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and others.

In 1980, she appeared as herself in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' where she sang "Don't It Make You Wanna Dance".

For her next record, 1982's ''[[Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)|Green Light]]'', Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this had a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

====''Tongue and Groove'' and release from Warner Brothers====
In 1983, Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, ''Tongue and Groove''. The day after mastering was completed on ''Tongue & Groove'', the record company dropped Raitt from its roster, not being happy with her commercial performance up to that point.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> The album was shelved and not released, and Raitt was left without a record contract. At this time Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.<ref name="notbroken">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bonnie-raitt-will-not-be-broken/ |title=Bonnie Raitt Will Not Be Broken |work=[[CBS News]] |last=Benjamin |first=Scott |date=February 18, 2009 |access-date=2012-04-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422171711/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |archive-date=April 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Despite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]", the anti-[[apartheid]] song written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow, Russia]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in [[Los Angeles]] for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and others.

Two years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the ''Tongue and Groove'' album. "I said it wasn't really fair," recalled Raitt. "I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''." That album, released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

In late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, she was clean and sober, having resolved her problems with substance abuse. She later credited [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] for his help in a [[Minnesota State Fair]] concert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |title=Grand stands: A longtime fairgoer's most unforgettable shows |author=Jon Bream |date=August 22, 2002 |publisher=StarTribune.com |access-date=2011-04-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828220833/http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |archive-date=August 28, 2007 }}</ref> the night after Vaughan's 1990 death. During this time, Raitt considered signing with the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-owned [[Paisley Park|Paisley Park Records]], but they could not come to an agreement and negotiations fell through. Instead, she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock songs under the production guidance of [[Don Was]] at [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

Raitt had met Was through [[Hal Willner]], who was putting together ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', a tribute album to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] music for [[A&M Records|A&M]]. Was and Willner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for "[[Baby Mine (song)|Baby Mine]]", the lullaby from ''[[Dumbo]]''. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Was to produce her next album.

===1989–1999: Commercial breakthrough===
[[Image:Bonnie Raitt.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt at the 1990 [[Grammy Awards]]]]
After working with Was on the ''Stay Awake'' album, Raitt's management, Gold Mountain, approached numerous labels about a new record deal and found interest from [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Raitt was signed to Capitol by A&R executive [[Tim Devine]]. With her first Capitol Records release, and after nearly twenty years in the business, Raitt achieved commercial success with ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'', her tenth overall album of her career.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Released in the spring of 1989, ''Nick of Time'' went to number one on the U.S. album chart following Raitt's Grammy sweep in early 1990.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> This album has also been voted number 230 in the ''Rolling Stone'' list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Raitt later stated that her 10th try was "my first sober album."<ref>{{cite magazine

At the same time, Raitt received a fourth [[Grammy Award]] for her duet "[[I'm in the Mood (John Lee Hooker song)|I'm in the Mood]]" with [[John Lee Hooker]] on his album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> ''Nick of Time'' was also the first of many of her recordings to feature her longtime rhythm section of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[James "Hutch" Hutchinson]] (although previously Fataar had played on her ''Green Light'' album and Hutchinson had worked on ''Nine Lives''), both of whom continue to record and tour with her. Since its release in 1989, ''Nick of Time'' has currently sold over five million copies in the US alone.

Raitt followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her next album, 1991's ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'', which sold seven million copies in the United States. Three years later, in 1994, she added two more Grammys with her album ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'', her second number one album, that sold two million copies in the US.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Raitt's collaboration with Don Was amicably came to an end with 1995's live release ''[[Road Tested]]''.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Released to solid reviews, it was certified [[Music recording certification|gold]] in the US.

"[[Rock Steady (Bonnie Raitt and Bryan Adams song)|Rock Steady]]" was a hit written by [[Bryan Adams]] and [[Gretchen Peters]] in 1995. The song was written as a duet with Bryan Adams and Bonnie Raitt for her Road Tested tour, which also became one of her albums. The original demo version of the song appears on Adams' 1996 single "Let's Make a Night to Remember".

For her next studio album, Raitt hired [[Mitchell Froom]] and [[Tchad Blake]] as her producers. "I loved working with [[Don Was]] but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different," Raitt stated. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on ''[[Fundamental (Bonnie Raitt album)|Fundamental]]'' in 1998.

===2000–2007===
[[File:BonnieRaitt2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt performing at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], April 23, 2004]]
In March 2000, Raitt was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio. ''[[Silver Lining (Bonnie Raitt album)|Silver Lining]]'' was released in 2002. In the US, it reached number 13 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] and was later certified Gold. It contains the singles "I Can't Help You Now", "Time of Our Lives", and the title track. All three singles charted within the top 40 of the US Adult Contemporary chart.

[[File:Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt 1997-09-24 61236-12.jpg|thumb|Raitt with musician Jackson Browne at a 1997 press conference opposing the proposed [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]]]]

Raitt's political involvement goes back to the early 1970s. Her 1972 album ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'' had a dedication "to the people of [[North Vietnam]] ..." printed on the back. Raitt's web site urges fans to learn more about preserving the environment. She was a founding member of [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] in 1979 and a catalyst for the larger [[anti-nuclear movement]], becoming involved with groups like the [[Abalone Alliance]] and Alliance for Survival. In 1994 at the urging of [[Dick Waterman]], Raitt funded the replacement of a headstone for one of her mentors, blues guitarist [[Fred McDowell]] through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]]. Raitt later financed memorial headstones in Mississippi for musicians [[Memphis Minnie]], [[Sam Chatmon]], and [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]] again with the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund.

In 2002, Raitt signed on as an official supporter of [[Little Kids Rock]], a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools throughout the U.S. She has visited children in the program and sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary member.

At the [[Stockholm Jazz Festival]] in July 2004, Raitt dedicated a performance of "Your Good Thing (Is About to End)", from her 1979 album ''[[The Glow (Bonnie Raitt album)|The Glow]]'', to sitting (and later re-elected) U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]. She was quoted as saying "We're gonna sing this for George Bush because he's out of here, people!".{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==Guitar==
Raitt's principal touring guitar is a customized [[Fender Stratocaster]] that she nicknamed Brownie. This became the basis for a signature model in 1996. Raitt was the first female musician to receive a signature Fender line.

{{blockquote|My brown Strat—the body is a '65 and the neck is from some time after that. It's kind of a hybrid that I got for $120 at 3 o' clock in the morning in 1969. It's the one without the paint, and I've used that for every gig since 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Bonnie_Raitt_Return_of_the_Blues_Baroness|title=Bonnie Raitt: Return of the Blues Baroness|date=March 9, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223022339/http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Bonnie_Raitt_Return_of_the_Blues_Baroness|archive-date=February 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}
