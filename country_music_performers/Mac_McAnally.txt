'''Lyman Corbitt McAnally Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|k|ən|æ|l|iː}}; born July 15, 1957), known professionally as '''Mac McAnally''', is an American singer-songwriter, session musician, and record producer. In his career, he has recorded ten studio albums and eight singles. Two of his singles were hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and six more on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. His ninth chart entry came in late 2008-early 2009 as a guest vocalist on [[Kenny Chesney]]'s cover of his 1990 single "[[Down the Road (Mac McAnally song)|Down the Road]]".

In addition to his work as a solo artist, McAnally has written number-one singles for [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] and [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], as well as songs for [[Sawyer Brown]] and [[T.G. Sheppard]] among others. He also holds a number of credits as a [[session musician]], and has [[record producer|produced]] for Sawyer Brown, [[Restless Heart]], and [[Jimmy Buffett]]. McAnally was also a longtime member of Buffett's backing band, [[the Coral Reefer Band]], until Buffett's death in 2023.

==Biography==
=== Early life and career ===
Lyman Corbitt McAnally Jr. was born in [[Red Bay, Alabama]]. As a child, he began playing piano and singing in church at the Belmont First Baptist Church in [[Belmont, Mississippi]], and by age fifteen, he had composed his first song.<ref name="allmusic"/> From there, he went on to become a session musician in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]]. During a session break, McAnally began to perform original material. The producers there encouraged him, and by 1977 he was signed to [[Ariola Records]]. His self-titled debut album produced the single "It's a Crazy World" which reached No.&nbsp;37 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Reviewing it in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] said, "although it does often sound pat, as folk [[stoicism]] will in a [[post-folk]] context, the first side comes across pretty outspoken for a Mississippi singer-songwriter with royalties in the bank—the heroine of one song is a rape victim who murders both assailant and judge after the latter lets off the former. Side two is [[Joe South]]."<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: M|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=M&bk=70|access-date=March 7, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies}}</ref>

A second album, ''No Problem Here'', was issued in 1978, followed in 1980 by ''Cuttin' Corners'' on [[RCA Records]]. These latter two albums produced no chart singles. However, he found success as a songwriter for [[Jimmy Buffett]], in addition to co-writing [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]'s Number One hit "[[Old Flame (Alabama song)|Old Flame]]".<ref name="allmusic"/>

McAnally continued to record even while writing for Buffett.  Mac eventually signed with Geffen Records with two albums (''Nothin' but the Truth'', which included the single "Minimum Love" which reached No.&nbsp;41 on the Billboard Hot 100, and ''Finish Lines'') being issued in 1983 and 1988, respectively. He and [[Walt Aldridge]] co-wrote [[Ricky Van Shelton]]'s 1987 single "[[Crime of Passion (Ricky Van Shelton song)|Crime of Passion]]".<ref name="allmusic"/>

===1990s and 2000s===
{{Expand section|Critical reception, awards & nominations, session work|date=June 2010}}
In 1990, McAnally signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]], releasing ''Simple Life'' that year. This album produced his first Top 40 country hit in the No.&nbsp;14 "[[Back Where I Come From]]." [[Kenny Chesney]] would also record McAnally's "Back Where I Come From" for his 1996 album ''[[Me and You (Kenny Chesney album)|Me and You]]''. Also in 1990, [[Steve Wariner]] released a McAnally co-write, the Top Ten hit "[[Precious Thing]]."<ref name="allmusic"/> The only other single from ''Simple Life'' was the No.&nbsp;70 "[[Down the Road (Mac McAnally song)|Down the Road]]", and by year's end, he exited Warner Bros.' roster.

McAnally's seventh studio album, ''Live and Learn'', followed in 1992, producing three low-charting singles. Also that year, he produced [[Sawyer Brown]]'s album ''[[The Dirt Road]]'', and continued to produce almost all of their subsequent albums, in addition to co-writing several of the band's singles between then and the late 1990s, including the Number One "[[Thank God for You]]", as well as the Top Five hits "[[All These Years]]", "Cafe on the Corner", "The Boys and Me", and "This Time". His second and final release for MCA, 1994's ''Knots'', failed to produce any chart singles, although [[Linda Davis]] charted that year with "Company Time", which he wrote. Throughout the 1990s, McAnally also found work as a session musician, playing guitar on several artists' albums, in addition to joining Buffett's road band.

It was not until 1999, when he signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville, that McAnally released his next album.<ref name="allmusic"/> This album, ''Word of Mouth'', also failed to produce any singles. Another album, ''Semi-True Stories'', followed in 2004 on [[Mailboat Records]], the same label to which Buffett is signed. Also in 2004, McAnally and [[Kyle Lehning]] produced [[Restless Heart]]'s reunion album ''[[Still Restless]]'', which included covers of three McAnally songs. In 2008, McAnally was awarded Musician of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. Also in 2008, he participated in the production of the album ''Psalngs'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.psalngs.com/ Press.Psalngs.com|title=Press for Psalngs.com|work=Press.Psalngs.com|access-date=August 28, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825021755/http://press.psalngs.com/|archive-date=August 25, 2011}}</ref> the debut release of Canadian musician [[John Lefebvre]].

[[Kenny Chesney]] covered McAnally's 1990 single "Down the Road" on his 2008 album ''[[Lucky Old Sun]]'', as a duet with McAnally. This rendition, released in late 2008 as its second single, became McAnally's first Top 40 country hit since "Back Where I Come From" in 1990. In February 2009, it became his first Number One as a singer. One month later, McAnally signed to [[Show Dog Nashville]], a label owned by [[Toby Keith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/mac-mcanally-signs-with-show-dog-records|title=Mac McAnally Signs with Show Dog Records|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|date=March 1, 2009|work=Roughstock|access-date=March 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318044907/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/mac-mcanally-signs-with-show-dog-records|archive-date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> His first single release for the label is "You First". His first album for the label, ''Down by the River'', debuted at No.&nbsp;56 on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart, becoming his first chart entry on that chart since 1990.

In 2011, Mac McAnally released the new album ''Live in Muscle Shoals'' on Mailboat Records, recorded in July 2010 at the [[W. C. Handy Music Festival]] in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Appearing with him were the Coral Reefer Band, bassist [[Jim Mayer (musician)|Jim Mayer]] and drummer Roger Guth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1673576/mac-mcanally-reprises-career-in-live-in-muscle-shoals.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118011344/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1673576/mac-mcanally-reprises-career-in-live-in-muscle-shoals.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 18, 2011|title=CMT : News : Mac McAnally Reprises Career in Live in Muscle Shoals|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|access-date=January 4, 2014}}</ref> McAnally lives in a home in the River Bluff section in Sheffield, Alabama, on the Tennessee River.

In 2024, McAnally provided the voice of Terrence "Shaker" in the [[Country Bear Jamboree#Musical Jamboree|Country Bear Musical Jamboree]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. Additionally, McAnally helped arrange the songs for the show.
