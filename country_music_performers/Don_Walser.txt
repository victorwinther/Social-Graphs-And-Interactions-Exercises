'''Donald Ray Walser''' (September 14, 1934 – September 20, 2006) was an American [[country music]] singer.  He was known as a unique, award-winning [[yodeling]] "[[Texas]] [[country music]] legend."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.markrubin.com/war|title=Don Walser circa 1964<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Markrubin.com|access-date=September 14, 2024}}</ref>

== Music career ==
Walser was born in [[Brownfield, Texas]] and raised in [[Lamesa, Texas|Lamesa.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.donwalser.com/bragPage.htm|title=Don Walser: Official Website|website=Donwalser.com|access-date=April 16, 2016}}</ref> A [[Traditional music|roots music]]ian since he was 11 years old, Walser became an accomplished guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. He started his first band, The Panhandle Playboys, at age 16, and shared bills with another aspiring Texas singer, [[Buddy Holly]].

As [[rock'n'roll]] began to skyrocket in popularity, Walser opted to stay in the [[Texas Panhandle]], raise a family and work as a mechanic and later as an auditor for the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], rather than move to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and pursue a recording career. As a result, he had little following outside Texas for the first part of his career.  However, he never stopped playing and became widely known in Texas. From 1959 to 1961 Walser had a group called The Texas Plainsmen and a weekly radio program.  For the next three decades he was always in bands and played a heavy schedule. He wrote popular original songs such as "Rolling Stone from Texas", which received a four-star review in 1964 from [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] magazine.

As time went on, Walser also became known for maintaining a catalog of older, obscure country music and cowboy songs.  He kept alive old 1940s and 1950s tunes by country music pioneers such as [[Bob Wills]] and [[Eddy Arnold]], and made them his own in a style that blended elements of [[honky tonk]] and [[Western swing]]. He also was known for his extraordinary yodeling style in the tradition of [[Slim Whitman]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].

In 1984, the Guard transferred Walser to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], a center of the burgeoning [[alternative country|alt-country]] music scene.  He put together his Pure Texas Band and developed a strong local following. Walser opened for [[Johnny Cash]] in 1996.  In 1990, Walser was "discovered" by musician and [[talent scout]] TJ McFarland.<ref>[http://www.houstonpress.com/Issues/mostrecent/music/racket.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218151611/http://www.houstonpress.com/Issues/mostrecent/music/racket.html |date=December 18, 2005 }}</ref>

In 1994, aged 60, Walser retired from the Guard. Able to devote himself fully to music for the first time in his life, he was immediately signed by [[Watermelon Records]] and released the album ''Rolling Stone From Texas'', produced by Ray Benson of [[Asleep at the Wheel]].  His extraordinary vocal abilities earned him the nickname "the Pavarotti of the Plains" by a reviewer for [[Playboy Magazine|''Playboy'']] magazine. Because of his Austin base, he attracted fans from country music traditionalists, and [[alternative rock|alternative music]] and [[punk rock|punk]] fans.  His band later became the opening act for the [[Butthole Surfers]].

He had cameo roles in feature films with Western swing settings, especially an acclaimed and memorable role as the lead singer in a rodeo dance band, singing "I'll Hold You in My Heart," in the 1998 [[Stephen Frears]] film ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]'' — a performance often regarded as one of the highlights of the picture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Hi-Lo-Cowboys-at-Home-on-the-Range-Harrelson-2951762.php|title=`Hi-Lo' Cowboys at Home on the Range / Harrelson, Crudup bond and brawl in noirish film|website=Sfgate.com|access-date=September 14, 2024}}</ref>

In September 2003, Don Walser retired from live performances due to health issues. Three years later, Walser died due to complications from [[diabetes]] on September 20, 2006, six days after his 72nd birthday.
