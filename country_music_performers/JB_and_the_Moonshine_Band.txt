==History==
In early 2009, front man JB Patterson, lead vocalist, songwriter and rhythm guitarist for the band, gave up his advertising career to pursue his dream of being a songwriter, and listed an open casting call for musicians in his community.  Turnout for the audition was small; only three people showed up, but three was enough.  Gabe Guevara, Hayden McMullen and Chris Flores were immediately dubbed "the Moonshine Band."  After their first show at a local honky-tonk, JB and the boys began touring, and with a jury-rigged PA system and a rented U-Haul van, the band travelled through East Texas, quickly gaining a local following.<ref name="jbandthemoonshineband.com">{{cite web |url=http://jbandthemoonshineband.com/about |title=About |access-date=2012-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625163630/http://www.jbandthemoonshineband.com/about |archive-date=2012-06-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The group’s big break came while opening for [[Average Joe's Entertainment]] artist [[Colt Ford]] in March 2010.  The band’s country sound and outlaw attitude immediately caught the attention of Colt’s team in Nashville, TN, and in July 2010 JB and the Moonshine Band signed a record deal with Average Joe's Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bootfest.org/publicFiles/BootfestPressKit.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010129/http://www.bootfest.org/publicFiles/BootfestPressKit.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Label mates include country singer/songwriter Colt Ford, [[American Idol]] finalist [[Josh Gracin]], and award winning country duo [[Montgomery Gentry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://averagejoesent.com/ourstory |title=Bio |access-date=2012-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414132739/http://averagejoesent.com/ourstory |archive-date=2012-04-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The band’s debut album, “Ain’t Goin' Back to Jail” premiered in September 2010, with Gabe Guevara on drums, Hayden McMullen on lead guitar, Chris Flores on bass guitar and JB providing lead vocals, banjo, and acoustic guitar.
