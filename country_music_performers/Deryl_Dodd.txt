Originally a regular on the [[Texas]] club circuit, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], soon finding work as a lead guitar player, background vocalist and songwriter. After moving to Nashville in 1991 he played lead guitar for Tracy Lawrence and Martina McBride.

He released a third album for Columbia in 2002, followed by two more albums for [[Dualtone Records]]. Overall, Dodd has released five studio albums and a live album, and has charted nine singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. His highest-charting single, "A Bitter End", peaked at No.&nbsp;26 on the country charts and No.&nbsp;88 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in late 1998-early 1999.
