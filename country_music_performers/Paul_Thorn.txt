==Biography==
Thorn was raised in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]].{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} Before his professional music career began, he was a professional boxer, where he established a respectable 14–4 record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I-S8pmpMjc|title=Episode #3: Paul Thorn - Former Pro Boxer and Musician|access-date=May 10, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Boxing career highlights include winning the Mid-South Middleweight Championship in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and culminated with a nationally televised bout with former world champion [[Roberto Durán]],<ref name="GAC1" /> After a few years of working in a Tupelo furniture factory and playing in local clubs, he was discovered by music professional [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] (brother of [[The Police (band)|The Police]] drummer [[Stewart Copeland]]).

In 1997, while performing at a singer-songwriters night at a local pizza shop (Vanelli's), Roger Sovine, representing [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], overheard Thorn and was impressed with his singing and songwriting ability. He asked Thorn if he had his permission to share his name with other record companies in Nashville. A couple weeks later, Thorn called vOz Vanelli (owner of Vanelli's) and mentioned that several record companies were coming to Tupelo to hear him perform. Thorn asked if he could come and play at Vanelli's which vOz agreed to. After hearing Thorn perform, Wyatt Easterling (an associate of [[Miles Copeland III]]) brought Thorn to Nashville and within thirty days, Thorn opened for [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. Thorn was subsequently signed to a recording contract with [[A&M Records]] and recorded his first album, ''Hammer & Nail,'' in 1997. He left A&M soon after and followed ''Hammer & Nail'' with thirteen more albums, all self-released and self-produced with his writing and production partner, Billy Maddox.

Thorn's 2010 album ''Pimps and Preachers'' debuted at No.&nbsp;83 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]], his highest chart position to date. His 2012 album ''What the Hell Is Going On'' was the 12th Most Played Album of 2012 on the Americana Music Association Year-End Chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2012/03/22/bernie-williams-ruthie-foster-susan-tedeschi-and-more-join-the-allman-brothers-band/ |title=Bernie Williams, Ruthie Foster, Susan Tedeschi and More Join The Allman Brothers Band |date=March 22, 2012 |access-date=January 30, 2013}}</ref> ''What the Hell Is Going On'' was Thorn's first album to feature the songwriting of other artists<ref name="Bio--Paul Thorn">{{cite web|title=Bio—Paul Thorn|url=http://www.paulthorn.com/bio/|website=Paulthorn.com|access-date=August 2, 2016}}</ref> and the second record of his to debut on the Billboard Top 100 during its first week of release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mississippilegends.com/articles/tupelo%E2%80%99s-paul-thorn/ |title=Tupelo's Paul Thorn |last=Corbett |first=Stephen |date=July 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=January 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216121828/http://mississippilegends.com/articles/tupelo%E2%80%99s-paul-thorn/ |archive-date=February 16, 2013}}</ref>

Thorn has toured as an opening act for [[Huey Lewis & the News]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[John Prine]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Robert Cray]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Toby Keith]] and [[Jeff Beck]].

In 2014, Thorn released ''Too Blessed to Be Stressed'', which he described as a collection of "positive anthem songs."<ref>from an interview on the [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode212 Americana Music Show #212], published September 25, 2014.</ref> "I wrote these songs hoping they might put people in a positive mindset and encourage them to count their own blessings, like I count mine," Thorn observes. "There's no higher goal I could set for myself than to help other people find some happiness and gratitude in their lives."<ref name="Bio--Paul Thorn"/>

In March 2018, Thorn released an album, titled ''Don't Let the Devil Ride'', featuring several covers of gospel songs that were inspiration to him during his youth and adolescence.<ref name="npr.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/17/594260751/paul-thorn-revisits-his-gospel-roots|title=Paul Thorn Revisits His Gospel Roots|website=NPR.org |access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref> The album features several prominent artists in that genre such as the [[Blind Boys of Alabama]], [[The McCrary Sisters]], [[Bonnie Bishop]], and the [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]].<ref name="npr.org"/> The album peaked at No. 1 in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Blues Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/blues-albums|title=Blues Music: Top Blues Albums Chart|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref>

Later that month, the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] named March 27 'Paul Thorn Day' in recognition of his constant support of his home state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djournal.com/news/mississippi-house-honors-tupelo-s-thorn/article_c11fc244-44d5-5033-a0a7-eb3590e8d4c3.html|title=Mississippi House honors Tupelo's Thorn|author=Bobby Harrison|website=Djournal.com|access-date=May 22, 2018}}</ref> On May 7, 2018, [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting]] premiered a special featuring Thorn's current tour titled "Mission Temple Fireworks Revival,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpbonline.org/blogs/mississippi-public-broadcasting/paul-thorns-first-gospel-album-comes-to-life-on-mpb-television-may-7/|title=MPB : Mississippi Public Broadcasting|website=Mpbonline.org|access-date=May 22, 2018}}</ref> which features special guests such as the [[Blind Boys of Alabama]], [[The McCrary Sisters]], [[Bonnie Bishop]], and the [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]].

In 2019, Thorn's lead electric guitarist of 30 years, Bill Hinds, parted ways with the band. In a statement on Thorn's website, Hinds explains that he is starting a new chapter in his life, but will remain a musician.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paulthorn.com/blog/2019/5/15/a-farewell-from-guitarist-bill-hinds|date=May 15, 2019|title=A Farewell From Guitarist Bill Hinds|last=Hinds|first=Bill|website=Paulthorn.com}}</ref> Hinds spot in the Paul Thorn Band has been filled by Chris Simmons, a guitarist from Alabama, who played in [[Leon Russell]]'s band for five years.

In May 2020, multi-Grammy award-winning vocalist and pianist [[Diane Schuur]] released an album, featuring a cover of Thorn's, "Everybody Looks Good at the Starting Line."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://glidemagazine.com/243272/multi-grammy-award-winning-vocalist-pianist-diane-schuur-releases-stunning-bluesy-running-on-faith-album-review/?fbclid=IwAR19A97qUlKcqCs581CvRNq11MNjltnD16WNZ94S1tjfBjUCkylXBve-6i4 |title=MULTI-GRAMMY AWARD WINNING VOCALIST/PIANIST DIANE SCHUUR RELEASES STUNNING & BLUESY 'RUNNING ON FAITH' (ALBUM REVIEW) |website=Glidemagazine.com|date=May 5, 2020 |access-date=January 16, 2021}}</ref>
