==Beginnings==
Boudleaux Bryant was born in [[Shellman, Georgia]], in 1920 and attended local schools as a child. He trained as a classical violinist. Although he performed with the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra|Atlanta Philharmonic Orchestra]] during its 1937–38 season, he had more interest in country fiddling. Bryant joined [[Hank Penny]] and his Radio Cowboys, an Atlanta-based western music band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alancackett.com/felice-and-boudleaux-bryant-biography|title=Felice and Boudleaux Bryant Biography|website=Alancackett.com|accessdate=July 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/del-bryant-biography|title=Country Music &#124; Del Bryant Biography|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=July 22, 2021}}</ref>

Felice was born in Milwaukee in 1925 to an ethnic Sicilian family, and had written lyrics set to traditional Italian tunes. During [[World War II]], she sang and directed shows at the local [[USO]].<ref name="hallfame">[https://www.songhall.org/profile/Felice_Bryant "Felice Bryant"], Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed January 1, 2021</ref>

In 1945, Bryant met the 19 year-old Matilda Genevieve Scaduto (whom he called Felice), when he was performing at the Schroeder Hôtel, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, her home town, where she was working as an elevator operator.
Bryant and Scaduto eloped five<ref>{{cite web |url=http://performingsongwriter.com/felice-and-boudleaux-bryant/ |title=The story of legendary songwriters Felice and Boudleaux Bryant |website=performingsongwriter.com |access-date=May 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204112543/http://performingsongwriter.com/felice-and-boudleaux-bryant/ |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> days after meeting.<ref name="hallfame"/> She has said that she "recognized" him immediately; she had seen his face in a dream when she was eight years old, and had "looked for him forever".

"All I Have to Do Is Dream" was biographical for Felice.

==Songwriting career==
During the first years of their marriage, the Bryants struggled financially, living in a [[mobile home]], where they wrote more than 80 songs. They tried to sell their compositions to a number of country music artists but were either ignored or rejected until [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] recorded their song "Country Boy." It went to No. 7 on the country chart in 1948 and opened the door to a working relationship with [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]] at [[Acuff-Rose Music]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

In 1950, the Bryants moved to Nashville to work full-time at songwriting. Some of their compositions from the early 1950s included the swinging "Sugar Beet" (recorded by [[Moon Mullican]]) and the bluesy "Midnight" (recorded by [[Red Foley]]).

The Bryants wrote more songs for Dickens as well as for country artist [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]]. At the same time, they released four 45-rpm singles of their own to modest success.

Beginning in 1957, the Bryants came to national prominence in both country and pop music when they wrote a string of very successful songs for [[the Everly Brothers]]<ref name=pc9>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19757/m1/ |title=Show 9 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis. [Part 1] }}</ref> and hits for other singers such as [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Buddy Holly]]. Their compositions were recorded by many artists from a variety of musical genres, including [[Lynn Anderson]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Sonny James]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Bob Moore (musician)|Bob Moore]], [[Charley Pride]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Leo Sayer]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], The [[Grateful Dead]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Count Basie]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Gram Parsons]], [[Joan Jett]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. (Dylan's ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]'' album has a song by Boudleaux and another he co-wrote with Felice.)

[[File:Felice & Boudleaux Bryant - The Hit Songs of Felice & Boudleaux Bryant 1949-62.jpg|thumb|right|The Bryants wrote hits for many artists.]]

In 1962, The Bryants wrote "Too Many Chicks," a song that became a hit for Leona Douglas, the first African-American woman to record as a [[country music]] singer.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=November 10, 1962 |title=Music Week - Spotlight Singles of the Week |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_SRgEAAAAMBAJ |access-date=July 12, 2015 |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Internet Archive |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_SRgEAAAAMBAJ/page/n45 48] |quote=leona douglas jealous heart.}}</ref>

The Bryants eventually moved to a house not far from Nashville on [[Old Hickory Lake]] in Hendersonville, Tennessee, near friends [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. In 1978, they moved to [[Gatlinburg]], Tennessee. They had often stayed at The Gatlinburg Inn, where they wrote numerous songs, including "[[Rocky Top]]." They purchased the Rocky Top Village Inn in the town next to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. In 1979, they released their own album called ''A Touch of Bryant.'' "[[Rocky Top]]", written in 1967, was adopted as a state song by Tennessee in 1982,<ref name="Larkin50"/> and as the unofficial fight song for the University of Tennessee sports teams. The Bryants wrote more than 6,000 songs, some 1,500 of which were recorded.<ref name="hallfame"/>

During their career, the Bryants earned 59 [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] country, pop, and [[R&B]] music awards. In 1972, they were inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], in 1986 into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]],<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Fifties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-732-0|pages=56/7}}</ref> and in 1991 into both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Boudleaux Bryant is the third most successful songwriter of the 1950s on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and Felice Bryant is the 21st.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davemcaleer.com/page23.htm |title=CHART GALLERY 10 CHARTS 41–61 |publisher=Dave McAleer |access-date=July 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318080828/http://www.davemcaleer.com/page23.htm |archive-date=March 18, 2014 }}</ref>

Their works are present in the House of Bryant, which is located in [[Gatlinburg]]. From September 2019 to August 2020, their artifacts were on exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville.

In 1991, the Nashville Arts Foundation honored her with its Living Legend Award.
