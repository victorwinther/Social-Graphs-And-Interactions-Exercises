'''Keith Harling''' (born May 8, 1963)<ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Keith-Harling.html |title=Keith Harling Biography |accessdate=September 14, 2007 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> is an American former [[country music]] artist. He made his debut in 1998 with the album ''Write It in Stone'', issued on the [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] label. It produced four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. A second album, ''Bring It On'', was issued a year later on the [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]] label.

==Biography==
Harling was born in [[Greenwood, South Carolina]]. His family moved to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] when he was still young.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p291311|pure_url=yes}} |title=Keith Harling biography |accessdate=September 14, 2007 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> At age ten, Harling constructed a drum kit, which he taught himself how to play; he also developed his musical style through impersonation of songs that he saw on television.<ref name="allmusic"/> Later on, when in high school, Harling also learned to play bass guitar, saxophone, and trumpet, all of which he played in several bands.<ref name="allmusic"/>

He initially moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], only to return to Chattanooga after failing to make himself known in Nashville.<ref name="oldies"/> By 1996, however, he returned to Nashville, where he soon found work as a songwriter for [[MCA Nashville Records]].<ref name="oldies"/> After only six weeks as a session songwriter, he was also signed to a record deal. In 1998, Harling's debut album, ''Write It in Stone'', was released.<ref name="allmusic"/> Consisting mostly of songs co-written by Harling, his debut album produced two Top 40 entries on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts in "Papa Bear" and "Coming Back for You", but additional singles proved less successful.

Having been dropped from MCA Nashville's roster in early 1999, Harling later signed to [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]], releasing his second album ''Bring It On'' that year. On his second album, however, Harling was persuaded to record mostly other writers' material instead of his own.<ref name="oldies"/> The album's only official single, which was the title track, peaked at No.&nbsp;52. Another selection from the album, "Santa's Got a Semi", charted in both 2000 and 2001 as a Christmas single before Harling exited Giant as well. Keith is currently living in the Chattanooga, Tn. area operating a small business with his wife
