'''Robert Lee Helms''' (August 15, 1933 – June 19, 1997) was an American [[Country music|country]] singer, who is best remembered for his 1957 [[Christmas music|Christmas hit]] "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]". Additionally, he had two other hit records from that year: "[[Fraulein (song)|Fraulein]]" and "[[My Special Angel]]".

==Life and career==
Robert Lee Helms was born in 1933 in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] (some sources say nearby [[Helmsburg, Indiana|Helmsburg]]), the son of Hildreth Esther (née Abram) and Fred Robert Helms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=Bobby Helms Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-helms-mn0000063722|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=15 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvFJDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Hildreth+Esther+Abram+Helms+and+Fred+Robert+Helms%22&pg=PA376|title=A Year of Indiana History - Book 1: 366 Indiana History Stories|first=Paul R.|last=Wonning|publisher=Mossy Feet Books|page=376|via=Google Books}}</ref> His family was musical. Helms began performing as a [[duet (music)|duo]] with his [[sibling|brother]], Freddie, before going on to a successful [[solo (music)|solo]] career in country music. In 1956, Helms made his way to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], where he signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Decca Records]], and achieved multiple successes the following year. His first [[single (music)|single]] in 1957, titled "[[Fraulein (song)|Fraulein]]", went to No. 1 on the country music [[record chart|chart]] and made it into the [[Top 40]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100#History|''Billboard'' Best Sellers in Stores]] chart. Later that same year, he released "[[My Special Angel]]", which also hit No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts and entered the [[Top 40|Top 10]] on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[pop music]] chart, peaking at No. 7. It sold over one million copies, earning a [[music recording certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd

His song "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]", which was released in the late fall of 1957, produced by Paul Cohen<ref>Decca Records</ref> was a big [[chart-topper|hit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2014/12/16/jingle-bell-rock-hoosier-bobby-helms/20477989/|author=Lindquist, David|title=''Jingle Bell Rock'' cemented legacy for Hoosier Bobby Helms|website=IndyStar.com|publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref> and was being played and danced to on [[Dick Clark]]'s teen dance show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' by mid-December of that year. It also re-emerged in four out of the next five years, and sold so well that it repeated each time as a top hit, becoming a Christmas classic still played today. (In 2016, it was rated radio's third most-played Christmas song, according to StationIntel).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideradio.com/all-christmas-stations-start-strategy-with-classics/article_b057fa36-bddf-11e6-8354-ffd2060f03d0.html|title=All-Christmas Stations Start Strategy With Classics.|website=Insideradio.com|date=9 December 2016 }}</ref> It took five years for the song to become a second million-seller for Helms.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/102 102]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/102}}</ref> It reached No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and spent 21 weeks on the [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2"/>  The [[gramophone record|record]] gained [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2"/> At the end of a television performance of the song toward the end of his life, Helms said, “I didn’t want to do the song when they first brought it to me, but now I'm sure glad I did.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPkheJRt_Q |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/UiPkheJRt_Q| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Jingle Bell Rock|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=March 2021}} [[American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[AllMusic]] list the writers of the song as Joseph Beal, Joseph Carlton, James Ross, and James Boothe.

Another record by Helms was "Schoolboy Crush", which was a hit in the UK. It was released in the United States on June 23, 1958, on Decca. The same song was then covered by UK teen star [[Cliff Richard]] about the same time as the UK release.

Helms continued touring and [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] for the next three decades. His pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Helms suffered from emphysema, asthma, diabetes, and stomach problems. He began wearing an eye patch after losing sight in his right eye. He was a longtime resident of [[Martinsville, Indiana]], until his death from complications from emphysema at the age of 63 on June 19, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1996 - 1997 |website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>
