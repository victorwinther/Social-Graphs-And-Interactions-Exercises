Armiger entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart for the first time in 2010 with "Kiss Me Now," which reached a peak of number 55.

It charted on both Billboard Top Country Albums and Billboard Heatseekers. This album was Armiger's first self-titled album and featured nine tracks that Armiger co-wrote with Nashville songwriters. "Leaving Home" and "Best Song Ever" followed as the album's second and third singles, the former failed to chart, while the latter peaked at number 42.
