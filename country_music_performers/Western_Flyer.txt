'''Western Flyer''' was an American [[country music]] band founded in 1992 by Danny Myrick (lead vocals, bass guitar), [[Chris Marion]] (keyboards, vocals), T. J. Klay (harmonica, [[mandolin]], vocals), Bruce Gust (drums, vocals), Steve Charles (lead guitar, vocals), and Roger Helton ([[acoustic guitar]], [[banjo]], vocals). The band released two albums for [[Step One Records]], as well as six singles. Their highest peaking single is "What Will You Do with M-E?", which reached No.&nbsp;32 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts in 1996.

==History==
Western Flyer was founded in 1992 by lead singer and bass guitarist Danny Myrick and keyboardist Chris Marion. Completing the lineup were harmonicist/mandolinist T.J. Klay, drummer Bruce Gust, lead guitarist Steve Charles, and guitarist/banjoist Roger Helton. The band members met in Nashville at a church where some of them had been playing in the church band.  The band took the name Western Flyer from a brand of bicycle.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=456|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rush |first=Diane Samms |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qbwwAAAAIBAJ&pg=6755%2C4222623 |title=Western Flyer's in gear |work=[[Lakeland Ledger]] |date=November 27, 1994 |page=6C |accessdate=2015-08-30 }}</ref>

The group signed to the independent Step One Records label in 1993, and released a self-titled debut album a year later. This album accounted for five chart singles, of which four reached the lower regions of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. The album's third release, "[[Cherokee Highway]]", did not chart in the U.S., although it was a Top 40 hit on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts and received media attention for its story of interracial violence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/405063/COUNTRY-SONG-DARES-TO-ATTACK-RACISM-HEAD-ON.html?pg=all |title=Country song dares to tackle racism head-on |accessdate=2008-08-04 |date=February 18, 1995 |work=[[Deseret News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Van |url=http://archives.timesleader.com/1994_13/1994_10_03_FOR_BAND_WESTERN_FLYER__NO_ROAD_S_TOO_ROUGH__NO_SUBJECT_S_TOO_TO.html |title=For Band Western Flyer, No Road's Too Rough, No Subject's Too Tough |work=[[Times Leader]] |date=October 3, 1994 |accessdate=2015-08-30 }}</ref>

Western Flyer's second album, 1996's ''Back in America'', produced its highest charting single in "What Will You Do with M-E?" which reached No.&nbsp;32 on the U.S. country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Also included on this album were "She Wants to Be Wanted Again," which [[Ty Herndon]] also released on his 1996 album ''[[Living in a Moment]]'' and released as a single in 1997, and "Lost in You", which received a "Critic's Choice" review in ''Billboard''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQkEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22western+flyer%22+billboard&pg=PA78 |title=Reviews and Previews |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 16, 1996 |page=78 |accessdate=2015-08-30 }}</ref> ''Back in America'' produced no other chart singles, and Western Flyer disbanded in 1997. Marion subsequently joined the [[Little River Band]], a [[rock music|rock]] group, in 2004. Danny Myrick signed to a songwriting contract with 3 Ring Circus Music, which is owned by [[Jeffrey Steele]]. Myrick has co-written "[[International Harvester (song)|International Harvester]]" for [[Craig Morgan (singer)|Craig Morgan]], "Loud" for [[Big & Rich]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3ringcircusmusic.com/content/home_c.htm |title=3 Ring Circus Music |accessdate=2008-04-01 }}</ref> the Number One hit "[[She's Country]]" for [[Jason Aldean]], and "[[How Far Do You Wanna Go?]]" by [[Gloriana (band)|Gloriana]].
