'''Aaron Jeoffrey Benward '''(born September 13, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter.

==Life and career==
Benward is the son of Candice and [[Jeoffrey Benward]] and has two siblings, Sareece and Colin. In [[high school]], he left his mark as an All-State football, basketball and soccer player and was named the U.S. Army Scholar/Athlete of the Year. After graduating, he decided to pursue a college degree before getting involved in music on a professional level. He attended college on a soccer scholarship studying music business at [[Belmont University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

In 1991, he surprised his father Jeoffrey when he told his dad that he wanted to follow his steps in the music business. They went on to form a unique son/father duo called [[Aaron Jeoffrey]] that achieved great success in the [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] scene. They garnered 10 #1 Billboard CCM singles and sold over 1,000,000 copies on all three of their EMI released albums combined.

Benward met his wife, Kenda, in [[San Jose, California]], and married in 1994. In the late 1990s, Benward decided to pursue a solo career. While recording his first solo album, Benward, his wife and children, were involved in a near fatal car accident. After recovering from his injuries, Benward was able to release his debut album titled ''Imagine'', that had Billboard #1 single called "Captured" in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/artists/aaronbenward.html|title=Music|website=Christianitytoday.com|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}</ref>
