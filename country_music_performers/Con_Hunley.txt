==Life and career==
Hunley was born in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], United States. After graduating from Central High School in Knoxville, Hunley began playing with local bands, maturing musically and gaining his first fans. Hunley joined the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in 1965,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and spent most of his service on a military base in [[Illinois]], teaching aircraft mechanics. He played music in area clubs whenever possible.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

After his tour of duty was finished Hunley returned to Knoxville and began performing weekly at a local nightclub (a dive called, "The Corner Lounge"), where he met businessman Sam Kirkpatrick, who formed the independent label Prairie Dust Records to showcase Hunley's talents.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After some minor success on the country music chart, Hunley caught the attention of [[Warner Bros. Records]], who signed him in 1978.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Hunley recorded five albums with Warner Bros., released several singles on [[MCA Records]] and [[Capitol Records]], and achieved more than 20 charted hits, including "Weekend Friend", "No Relief In Sight", and "[[Oh Girl]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He toured throughout the U.S., playing large venues around the country with other musical acts, including [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Larry Gatlin]], [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]]. In 1986 Hunley had his final chart appearance with "Quittin' Time".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Hunley recorded no new music for over a decade after his last release for Capitol Records.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Hunley's long recording hiatus ended after signing with IMMI Records in 2004. He teamed again producer [[Norro Wilson]], the architect of several of his early Warner Brothers hits, and added his first new recorded product in twenty years, ''Sweet Memories'', to his catalog. The album was selected by CMT.com as one of the top 10 albums of 2004.

In early 2006, IMMI Records released ''Shoot from the Heart'', another collaboration by Hunley and Norro Wilson. Hunley co-wrote two of the songs with songwriters Kim Williams and Larry Shell.

Hunley participates in celebrity [[golf]] tournaments around the country, and hosts one of his own each year in his hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, which has raised over a million dollars for charities benefiting underprivileged children.
