==Life and career==
===1959–1980: Early life and career beginnings===
Sheena Shirley Orr was born on 27 April 1959, at [[Bellshill Maternity Hospital]] in [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canaries.co.uk/News/2016/march/canaries.co.uk-exclusive/|title=How Alex Neil's career has readied him for his biggest challenge yet|date=18 March 2016|publisher=Norwich City Football Club|access-date=2 August 2019}}</ref> the youngest of six children of Annie and [[steel mill]] labourer Alex Orr. She has two brothers, Robert and Alex, and three sisters, Marilyn, Anessa, and Morag. Her earliest-known public performance as a singer was in 1964 at the age of five, when she sang "[[Early One Morning]]" for her uncle and aunt and various relatives at the couple's 25th wedding anniversary celebration.<ref name="Official website">{{cite web|url=http://www.sheenaeaston.com|title=Sheena Easton – The Official Website|work=sheenaeaston.com}}</ref>

Easton's father died in 1969 and her mother had to support the family. According to Easton's website, despite her mother's heavy workload she was always available for her children: "Sheena always speaks very highly of her mum and the wonderful job she did in bringing up her and her siblings, including teaching them all to read at home before they were even enrolled in school."<ref name="Official website"/>

Easton did not consider a singing career until she saw the movie ''[[The Way We Were]]'', with [[Barbra Streisand]]. Streisand's singing over the opening credits "overtook" the young girl and convinced her that what she wanted most was to be a singer and to have the same effect on others.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.iheart.com/artist/sheena-easton-30505/ | title=Sheena Easton }}</ref>

Her top grades in school earned her a scholarship to attend the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] in [[Glasgow]], where she trained from 1975 to 1979 as a speech and drama teacher by day, while singing with a band called "Something Else" by night at local clubs.<ref name="Official website"/> She chose to study teaching rather than performing, because it was a course of study that would let her perfect her craft as a singer.<ref name="Official website"/>

In 1979, she married Sandi Easton, the first of her four husbands. They divorced after eight months, and Sheena decided to keep the surname Easton. That year, one of her tutors coaxed her into auditioning for [[Esther Rantzen]], producer of the BBC programme ''[[The Big Time (TV series)|The Big Time]]''. Rantzen was planning a documentary film to chronicle a relative unknown's rise to pop-music stardom. Easton was selected as the subject for the programme; [[EMI]] executives awarded her a contract, and [[Christopher Neil]] was assigned as her recording producer. [[Deke Arlon]] became her first manager, and Easton spent much of 1980 being followed by camera crews, who filmed her throughout the process of her audition through to making her first EMI single, "Modern Girl". In the course of the filming, she met and sang for [[Dorothy Squires]], [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], whose manager [[Marion Massey]] told her that she saw Easton as a potential TV star with her own series, but not as a pop singer for the 1980s as she lacked "rugged individuality".

The encounter with Massey (then Marion London), at which Lulu was present, was filmed and included in the broadcast, at which time Massey was not entirely incorrect, as "Modern Girl" had flopped on its release, peaking at number 56 in just three weeks on the UK Singles Chart in April 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/18351/sheena-easton/|title=Sheena Easton &#124; full Official Chart History |website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=27 March 2022}}</ref> However, once the programme aired in August 1980, "Modern Girl" was reissued and the track and its follow up "Nine to Five" both leapt into the top 10, disproving Massey's prediction. In a revised and extended version of this episode of ''The Big Time'', broadcast in 1981; this special concluded with news of Easton's breaking into the American market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cWnf4yyvjM|title=Sheena Easton – The Big Time|last=Sheenaeaston Vids1|date=24 August 2017|access-date=23 November 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

===1981–1982: ''Take My Time'' and James Bond===
{{main|Take My Time|You Could Have Been with Me|Madness, Money & Music}}
{{see|For Your Eyes Only (song)}}

Easton's first single, the [[disco]]-tinged soft-synth-pop tune, "[[Modern Girl (Sheena Easton song)|Modern Girl]]", was released in the UK before [[The Big Time (TV series)|''The Big Time'']] aired, reaching number 56. At the end of the show, Easton was still unsure of her future as a singer. The question was resolved soon after the show aired, when her second single, "[[9 to 5 (Sheena Easton song)|9 to 5]]", reached number 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was certified a Gold single in 1980. "Modern Girl" re-entered the chart subsequently and climbed into the top 10, being certified a Silver single, and Easton found herself with two songs in the UK top 10 simultaneously.

"9 to 5" was Easton's first single release in the United States, although it was renamed "Morning Train (Nine To Five)" for its release in the US and Canada to avoid confusion with [[Dolly Parton]]'s hit movie title song "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]". "Morning Train (Nine to Five)" became Easton's first and only number 1 hit in the US and topped both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine. "Modern Girl" was released as the follow-up and peaked at number 18, and before 1981 was over she had a Top 10 hit in both the US and UK with the Academy Award-nominated [[James Bond]] movie theme "[[For Your Eyes Only (song)|For Your Eyes Only]]". The song was nominated for an Academy Award and Golden Globe award in 1982 in the category "Best Music (Original Song)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1317024989564|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707000214/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1317024989564|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-07|title=Session Timeout – Academy Awards® Database – AMPAS|work=oscars.org}}</ref> Easton's US success resulted in her winning the [[Grammy Award]] for "Best New Artist" for 1982.<ref name=":0"/> Easton actually appears in the opening credits of ''For Your Eyes Only'', performing the song; as of 2024, she remains the only Bond theme singer to be featured in this way.<ref>[[Madonna]], who recorded the theme song for ''[[Die Another Day]]'', has a small role in the film itself, but is not shown performing the song on screen.</ref>

Easton's first three US albums, [[Take My Time|''Sheena Easton'']] (1981) (retitled edition of ''Take My Time''), ''[[You Could Have Been with Me]]'' (1981), and ''[[Madness, Money & Music]]'' (1982), were all in the same [[soft rock]]/pop vein.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[You Could Have Been with Me (song)|title track]] from ''You Could Have Been with Me'' made it in to the US top 15; however, by the end of 1982, she saw her sales slumping.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Easton was one of the first artists to record "[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]" (included on ''Madness, Money & Music''), which later was a hit for [[Bette Midler]]. In 1982, Easton undertook her first US tour. Her performance in Los Angeles was videotaped and broadcast on [[HBO]] and later released on VHS and Laserdisc as ''Sheena Easton Live at the Palace, Hollywood''. On 8 November 1982, she appeared in the [[Royal Variety Performance]] in front of the Queen Mother singing [[Maybe This Time (song)|Maybe This Time]].<ref>Radio Times 14 November 1982</ref>

===1983–1987: ''Best Kept Secret'' and continued success===
{{main|Best Kept Secret (Sheena Easton album)|Todo Me Recuerda a Ti|A Private Heaven|Do You (album)|No Sound But a Heart}}

In January 1983, Easton duetted with [[Kenny Rogers]] and had a top 10 hit in the US with "[[We've Got Tonite#Kenny Rogers and Sheena Easton version|We've Got Tonight]]", a cover of the [[Bob Seger]] song. The recording also earned her a number 1 single on the Country chart, and it reached the UK Top 30. Around the time of her hit record with Rogers, Easton headlined ''Act One'', a one-hour variety special broadcast on [[NBC]] that featured Rogers and a cameo appearance by [[Johnny Carson]]. October 1983 saw the release of the album'' [[Best Kept Secret (Sheena Easton album)|Best Kept Secret]]'' and its first single, the synthesized [[dance-pop]] tune "[[Telefone (Long Distance Love Affair)]]", became her fourth Top 10 hit. The single was Grammy-nominated for "Best Female Pop Vocal Performance" of 1983.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title = Grammy Award Nominees 1984 – Grammy Award Winners 1984|url = http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1984-232.html}}</ref> The follow-up single, "[[Almost Over You]]", reached the US Top 30 and was a number 4 AC chart hit. "Almost Over You" was very popular in Asia and was covered by Chinese singer Cass Pang. It also became a hit on the Country charts for [[Lila McCann]] in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 1984, Easton recorded a Spanish-language single, "Me Gustas Tal Como Eres" ("I Like You Just the Way You Are"), a duet with Mexican star [[Luis Miguel]]. The single earned her a second Grammy, this time for Best Mexican-American Performance. The track was taken from the album ''[[Todo Me Recuerda a Ti]]'' (1984), and reissued by Capitol/EMI-Latin in 1989, which featured Spanish-language covers of seven previous Easton recordings and three new tracks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In the same year, she also made a transformation into a sexy dance-pop siren, changing her performance style in the process. She was rewarded with the biggest-selling US album of her career, RIAA certified gold & platinum ''[[A Private Heaven]]'' (1984), and her sixth Top 10 US single, "[[Strut (Sheena Easton song)|Strut]]". In the UK, however, the move was not a commercial success, as Easton would find herself shut out of the UK top 75 for the next three years.

Her career was increasing, particularly in the US, where Easton was again nominated for a Grammy Award, this time for "Best Female Pop Vocal Performance" in 1984.<ref name=":1"/> She was also one of the first artists to have a music video banned because of its lyrics rather than its imagery; some broadcasters refused to air the sexually risqué "[[Sugar Walls]]",{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} which had been written for her by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (using the [[pseudonym]] ''Alexander Nevermind''). "Sugar Walls" was named by [[Tipper Gore]] of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] as one of the "Filthy Fifteen", a list of songs deemed indecent because of their lyrics, alongside Prince's own "[[Darling Nikki]]".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The song eventually hit number 3 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B singles chart]], number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 1 on the Billboard Dance Chart in 1985.

Easton's follow-up to ''A Private Heaven'', entitled ''[[Do You (album)|Do You]]'' (1985), was produced by [[Nile Rodgers]] and achieved gold status, although it failed to generate any breakout singles of the chart calibre of "Strut" or "Sugar Walls". In late 1985, Easton contributed "It's Christmas (All Over the World)" to the holiday release ''[[Santa Claus: The Movie]]''. In 1987, the release of a follow-up album, ''[[No Sound But a Heart]]'' (1987),<ref name="BeckNews">Beck, Marilyn. "New director selected for 'No Man's Land'.

Songs from the album were covered by other artists: [[Crystal Gayle]] and [[Gary Morris]] featured "Wanna Give My Love" and "What if We Fall in Love" on a 1987 duet album named for the latter song; [[Celine Dion]] recorded "[[The Last to Know]]" on 1990's ''[[Unison (Celine Dion album)|Unison]]'' while Mexican singer [[Yuri (Mexican singer)|Yuri]] featured the tune on her album ''Espejos De Alma'' (1995); [[Patti LaBelle]] covered "Still in Love" on 1989's ''Be Yourself;'' [[Pia Zadora]] recorded "Floating Hearts" on 1989's ''Pia Z''. ''No Sound But a Heart'' eventually did get released in the United States in 1999, with four bonus tracks, including Easton's contributions to the soundtrack of the 1986 film ''[[About Last Night (1986 film)|About Last Night]]'', "Natural Love" and the Top 50 single "So Far, So Good".

=== 1987–1990: "U Got the Look" and ''The Lover in Me'' ===
{{Main|The Lover in Me (album)}}
{{see|U Got the Look}}

In 1987, Easton appeared in Prince's concert film ''[[Sign o' the Times (film)|Sign o' the Times]]'', during which she sang duet vocals for Prince's hit, "[[U Got the Look]]", which became a number 2 hit in the US. This led to Grammy nominations for "Best R&B Vocal, Duo or Group" and "Best R&B Song" of 1987.<ref>{{cite web|title = Grammy Award Nominees 1988 – Grammy Award Winners 1988|url = http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1988-236.html}}</ref> The track also returned Easton to the UK hit parade for the first time in nearly four years, although Easton is not credited on the label for the song's single release. During her time collaborating with Prince, Easton was encouraged to write her own material. The most successful effort from their co-writes was "The Arms of Orion", another duet with Prince and a single from 1989's [[Batman (album)|Batman soundtrack]]. The song reached number 36 on the US Billboard Chart and number 27 in her native UK. She also co-wrote the song "Love '89" with Prince for Patti LaBelle's album ''[[Be Yourself (Patti LaBelle album)|Be Yourself]]'' and "La, La, La, He, He, Hee", which [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] recorded for the B-side of the single "[[Sign o' the Times (song)|Sign o' the Times]]". Tabloid press linked the two romantically, which she has always denied.<ref name="ElfVegas">Elfman, Doug. "[http://www.lvrj.com/neon/41964477.html Doug Elfman: Grist For the Rumor Mill]." ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''. 27 March 2009.</ref> In November 1987, Easton made her first dramatic acting appearance on the television program ''[[Miami Vice]]''. She played a singer named Caitlin Davies, whom [[Sonny Crockett]] was assigned to protect until her court appearance to render crucial testimony against certain corrupt music industry mavens. Sonny and Caitlin ended up married by the end of the episode, the first of five episodes for Easton. By the spring of 1988, a volume of the ''Miami Vice'' soundtrack was released and featured "Follow My Rainbow", which Easton had finished singing on her last appearance just moments before her character was eliminated.

The song also appeared on her next album ''[[The Lover in Me (album)|The Lover in Me]]'' (1988), RIAA gold-disc debut released the following autumn on her new label [[MCA Records]], that put Easton back on the US and UK charts after the release of ''No Sound But a Heart'' was cancelled in the US. This album features Urban [[R&B]] and Dance-pop, and a sexier image.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[The Lover in Me (song)|title song]] from ''The Lover in Me'' reached number 2 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and UK number 15 and became her biggest pop hit since "Morning Train". It also became a number 5 hit on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks]] chart. It was followed on the US R&B chart by "Days Like This" (number 35), which missed the Billboard Hot 100. The third single, the Prince-penned "101", made it to number 2 on the ''Billboard'' Dance chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974–2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=86}}</ref> A final single was released "No Deposit, No Return" and failed to chart. The album received positive reviews and featured collaborations with [[L.A. Reid]] and [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]], Prince, [[Angela Winbush]] and [[Jellybean Benitez]].

In 1990, Easton revisited her home country of Scotland to perform at a festival (The Big Day) in [[Glasgow]]. Her new American accent was booed by the crowd and she had bottles (some containing urine) thrown at her. Visibly shaken, she was forced to cut her set short. She vowed never to perform in Scotland again.<ref>{{cite web|title=How a generation of stars bombed in Glasgow's notorious comics graveyard|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2008/12/12/how-a-generation-of-stars-bombed-in-glasgow-s-notorious-comics-graveyard-86908-20964184/|date=12 August 2008|publisher=Daily Record|access-date=2011-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Brian |title=Deacon Blue reveal they were terrified of following Sheena Easton on stage at their biggest ever gig |url=https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/deacon-blue-reveal-they-were-terrified-of-following-sheena-easton-on-stage-3453511 |website=scotsman.com |access-date=28 June 2024}}</ref>

=== 1991–1996: ''What Comes Naturally'' and decline===
{{main|What Comes Naturally|No Strings (album)|My Cherie}}

In 1991, ''[[What Comes Naturally]]'' became the last of Easton's albums to chart in the United States, peaking at number 90. The title song was also her last Top 40 single to date, reaching number 19. It also became her first hit in Australia since the mid-1980s, peaking at number 4.<ref>The Book Top 40 Research 8th Edition</ref> Two other singles, "You Can Swing It" and "To Anyone," followed but failed to chart. "What Comes Naturally" remained on the US pop chart for 10 weeks and 11 weeks on the ARIA Chart in Australia. Easton has songwriting credits on three tracks. She is also one of the few pop artists to adopt the [[new jack swing]] sound with chart success from the early 1990s.

In 1992, an unofficial recording of "Modern Girl" (Live in San Diego) was released by "That's Life" recordings in Germany and Japan. The music was from her early output with EMI and became a sort of bootleg version of her concert when she performed stateside on her first worldwide tour in 1982. Easton followed this with the non-charting but critically acclaimed ''[[No Strings (album)|No Strings]]'' (1993), an album of jazz standards produced by [[Patrice Rushen]]. It included her version of "[[The Nearness of You]]," which was also featured on the soundtrack of the film, ''[[Indecent Proposal]],'' in which Easton appeared in a cameo role. ''[[My Cherie]]'' (1995) was her last pop album to date to see domestic release in the United States. The album saw Sheena reunite with producer [[Christopher Neil]] for the first time in over a decade.

=== 1996–1999: ''Freedom'' and Colors of Christmas Tour ===
{{main|Freedom (Sheena Easton album)|Home (Sheena Easton album)}}

Easton contributed vocals to the soundtrack of ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'' and voiced the character Sasha La Fleur on "Count Me Out" and "I Will Always Be With You". Easton also performed "Now and Forever" with [[Barry Manilow]] for ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'' soundtrack in 1995. She contributed the theme song "Are There Angels" to the soundtrack for ''[[Shiloh (film)|Shiloh]]'' in 1996; and provided the song "A Dream Worth Keeping" for the 1992 [[animated film]] ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]''. In 1997, she played 'Melissa McCammon', a recording star, who is visited by time travellers from the future in a second-season episode of the Canadian television series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled "[[Falling Star (The Outer Limits)|Falling Star]]". The episode featured her singing two songs from ''[[My Cherie]]''.

In the late 1990s, Easton retained an album contract with [[MCA Records|MCA]] Japan and released two discs of new material. However, neither album was originally released in the United States. [[Freedom (Sheena Easton album)|''Freedom'']], released in 1997 to coincide with the launch of her website and finally released in (Limited Edition) stateside in 2007, was a return to her trademark pop, including a remake of her debut single "[[Modern Girl (Sheena Easton song)|Modern Girl]]". In 1999, [[Universal Records|Universal]]/[[Victor Records|Victor]] released the self-produced acoustic set, [[Home (Sheena Easton album)|''Home'']]. Also, around this time, Sheena Easton [[Greatest Hits]] collection featuring 12 MCA singles recorded from 1988 to 1995 released and charted in Japan at number 98 (additional greatest hits collections surfaced in the US and UK but did not chart).

Easton adopted a boy (Jake) and girl (Skylar) between 1995 and 1996. Motherhood led her to curtail her appearances and focus on casino gigs, corporate shows and theatrical work.<ref name="CorArizona">Cordova, Randy.

"I knew exactly when they were coming along, so I knew when I had to change my life so it would be a stable life."<ref name="CorArizona"/> Easton continued acting in America, starring in lead [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revivals of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' as (Aldonza) opposite [[Raul Julia]] in his last stage role (1992), and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' as [[Betty Rizzo|Rizzo]] (1996). Between 1994 and 1996, she played several characters in ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' the animated series, including Lady Finella, the Banshee, Molly and Robyn Canmore. In 1999, she voice-acted a part-demon character, Annah-of-the-Shadows, in the computer game ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. She lives in [[Las Vegas]] with her two children and often performs in various casinos' entertainment venues. She voiced the character of Fiona Canmore for a scripted but unfinished episode of the cancelled animated feature, ''[[Team Atlantis]]''.

In December 1998, Easton toured with the American production "The Colors of Christmas" with artists [[Roberta Flack]], [[Melissa Manchester]], [[Peabo Bryson]] and [[Jeffrey Osborne]]. [[Windham Hill]] Records produced "The Colors of Christmas" disc by Robbie Buchanan of holiday music. Easton contributed two tracks, "The Place Where We Belong" (a duet with Jeffrey Osborne) and "The Lord's Prayer".

===1999–2013: ''Fabulous'' and re-issues===
{{main|Fabulous (album)}}
[[File:SheenaEastonLiveA2009.jpg|thumb|right|Easton performing live in 2009]]

In 1999 New York–based [[One Way Records]] reserved the rights to release all of Easton's EMI-America catalogue. For the first time in the US, ''No Sound But a Heart'' was released, 12 years after the album was made available elsewhere. All of Easton's EMI back catalogue (with another exception of her Spanish-language album ''Todo Me Recuerda a Ti'') was re-released and remastered with bonus tracks, incorporating B-sides and remixes. Universal Japan released ''Best Ballads'', a disc of ballads from her six previous albums from her MCA catalogue with the exception of "For Your Eyes Only" for the Japanese market that failed to chart.

The album was released throughout Europe, Japan, Australia, and Argentina but not in the US. In Australia, "Fabulous" was released 24 February 2001 and Easton was asked to perform songs from the album to close out 2001 [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] ceremonies.

In 2003, Easton contributed vocals to "If You're Happy", a cover for a Japanese disc called ''Cover Morning Musume-Hello Project''. She also began to host ''Vegas Live'', a talk show with [[Clint Holmes]] (later replaced by [[Brian McKnight]]). In 2004, she was inducted into the Casino Legends Hall of Fame at the Tropicana Resort & Casino.
