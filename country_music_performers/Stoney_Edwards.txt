From an early age, Edwards dreamed of performing at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. After moving to the San Francisco area and raising a family there, Edwards would play music in his spare time. However, in 1968, a job-related accident would change his life forever. While working as a forklift operator in a steel refinery, Edwards got trapped in a sealed-up tank and suffered severe carbon dioxide poisoning. He was sidelined for the next two years in either a coma, a near-coma, or in a state bordering on insanity.<ref name='Poor-Folks'/>

As his condition improved, Edwards found work in odd jobs while at the same time devoting more of his energy to music. He sang in a [[honky tonk]] style reminiscent of [[Lefty Frizzell]] and [[Merle Haggard]].<ref name='OHS-Stoney'>{{cite web

In the wake of [[Charley Pride]]'s breakthrough success, the attorney knew that most labels were looking for a [[African-American|black]] country singer. Just six months after recovering from his accident, Edwards signed a contract with [[Capitol Records]].<ref name='Poor-Folks'/><ref name='AMG-Stoney'>{{cite web

Backed by a then little-known [[Bob Wills|Wills]] tribute band called [[Asleep at the Wheel]], Edwards entered the studio to record some songs. "A Two Dollar Toy," his first single at Capitol, was inspired by an incident in which his plans to leave his family were aborted by the sound of a child's toy.  Having refused to sue the steel company, Edwards would also not allow his wife to accept welfare.  Unable to support his family due to his disability, Edwards planned to sneak out of the house so that there would be one less mouth to feed.  However, as he was leaving, he stepped on a toy, waking his daughter, Janice.<ref name='Poor-Folks'/><ref name='Hillbilly'>{{cite web |url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=14940 |title=Stoney Edwards |publisher=Hillbilly-Music dawt com |accessdate=December 2, 2009 }}</ref><ref name='AMG-Stoney'/>

Edwards released five albums at [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] which included two singles to make the Top 20. While his chart success never reached the heights of [[Charley Pride]], Edwards had a devoted following. One of his biggest hits, "[[She's My Rock]]," which peaked at No.&nbsp;20 in 1973, was a No.&nbsp;6 single for [[Brenda Lee]] in 1975 (as "He's My Rock") and a No.&nbsp;2 hit for [[George Jones]] in 1984.<ref name='AMG-Stoney'/> On at least one occasion, Jones invited Edwards on stage to sing it.

Another one of his popular songs was "Hank and Lefty Raised My Country Soul," a tribute to [[Hank Williams]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]]. It hit the Top 40 in 1973.

In 1976, one of his last chart singles created the most controversy.  Many stations would not play, "Blackbird (Hold Your Head High)" because it contained the line "just a couple of country niggers" despite the song's affirmative message.<ref name='Poor-Folks'/><ref name='OHS-Stoney'/>

By the early 1980s, both his health and his career began to decline.  He died on April 5, 1997, of [[stomach cancer]].<ref name='SSDI'/><ref name='Poor-Folks'/><ref name='AMG-Stoney'/><ref name='FWIS-Liner'/>
