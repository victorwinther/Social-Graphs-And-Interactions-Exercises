'''Chapel Hart''', originally known as '''Hyperphlyy''', is an American [[country music]] vocal group from [[Poplarville, Mississippi]]. The group consists of sisters Danica Hart and Devynn Hart, and their cousin Trea Swindle, all three of whom are vocalists. Chapel Hart has independently released three studio albums and eleven singles. In July 2022, they competed in the [[America's Got Talent (season 17)|seventeenth season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', where they finished fifth. The group's music is defined by their vocal harmony and influence from other female country acts. The group's most popular song is "[[You Can Have Him Jolene]]", an [[answer song]] to [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]".

== Musical influences and style ==
In 2020, Danica told the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' that she was influenced by albums from [[George Strait]] and [[Kenny Rogers]]. She and Devynn have also cited [[Gretchen Wilson]] as a primary musical influence.<ref name="chron"/> Joey Guerra of the ''Houston Chronicle'' noted that Chapel Hart's sound is heavily reliant on their use of vocal harmony. He also found Danica's voice comparable to that of [[Etta James]], while also finding influences of a "classic [[girl group]]" sound on other songs.<ref name="chron"/> Later in 2020, Swindle told ''[[American Songwriter]]'' that she was aware of the unusual choice for an African American act to record country music, telling the publication: "You don't really choose [country music]. It was how we grew up and who we are."<ref name="zollo"/> Jessica Nicholson of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote of the group's style that it "blends tightly-woven, family harmonies with straight-from-the-heart lyrics".<ref name="devynn">{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/chapel-hart-glory-days-album-interview-1235331803/ | title=Chapel Hart On Unfiltered New Album ‘Glory Days’: ‘We Want to Tell Our Stories’ | publisher=Billboard | date=May 18, 2023 | accessdate=May 4, 2024 | author=Jessica Nicholson}}</ref> Devynn also said that the positive reception from their ''America's Got Talent'' performance of "You Can Have Him Jolene", which all three members of the trio wrote, inspired the trio to write more songs on ''Glory Days''.<ref name="devynn"/> [[AllMusic]] writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] describes Chapel Hart as "a spirited country music harmony group" and "steeped in tradition but ha[ving] a smart, knowing modern sensibility".<ref name="allmusic"/>
