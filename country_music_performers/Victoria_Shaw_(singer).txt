== Biography ==
Shaw was born in [[Manhattan]], New York City, on July 13, 1962.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p124297|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic Victoria Shaw Biography |access-date=November 5, 2007 |last=Bush |first=John |work=Allmusic}}</ref> Inspired by [[country rock]] musicians such as the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], she began writing songs at an early age.<ref name="allmusic" /> Later, she and her sister, Lori Shaw, found work performing together in the Los Angeles area. Shaw's mother, Carole Bergenthal, recorded for [[Capitol Records]] as Carole Bennett.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Bernarde|first=Scott R.|title=Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XI4-VnSrEcAC&pg=PA329 |year=2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=1-58465-303-5|page=329}}</ref> The Shaws moved to California when Shaw was about five years old. Her mother, who was Jewish, would sing Yiddish lullabies to her. By age thirteen, Shaw had founded a band called Solace, which performed at weddings and [[bar mitzvah]]s.<ref name="book" />

Eventually, Shaw moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she found a publishing contract and a record deal. A minor single, "Break My Heart", was released in 1984 on the MPB label, peaking at No.&nbsp;61 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Her first major hit as a songwriter came in 1992, when she co-wrote with [[Garth Brooks]] "[[The River (Garth Brooks song)|The River]]" which Brooks took to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' country singles chart.<ref name="oldies">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Victoria-Shaw.html |title=Victoria Shaw Biography |access-date=November 5, 2007 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> A year later, [[Doug Stone]] reached No. 1 on the country charts with Shaw's "[[Too Busy Being in Love]]". Later that same year, another Shaw-penned song — [[John Michael Montgomery]]'s "[[I Love the Way You Love Me]]" — also reached No. 1 the country charts and won an [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Song of the Year.<ref name="oldies" />

In 1994, Shaw signed to [[Reprise Records]], releasing her debut album ''In Full View'' that year. Three of this album's singles — "Cry Wolf", "Tears Dry" and "Forgiveness" — all reached the lower regions of the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. That same year, Brooks reached Number One with the song "[[She's Every Woman]]" which the two wrote together. In 1995, Shaw received a Top New Female Vocalist nomination from the [[Academy of Country Music]], losing to [[Chely Wright]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&s_site=ohio&p_multi=AK&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB631C7C5761AD4&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=30 Years of Country Music Saluted at Anniversary Show|access-date=September 18, 2009|publisher=[[Beacon Journal]]}}</ref>

Shaw's second album for Reprise, ''Victoria Shaw'', was released in 1997. However, it produced no chart singles. In 1998, Shaw collaborated with Brooks, [[Billy Dean]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Neal McCoy]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] and [[Bryan White]] for a charity single (written for the [[Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]]) entitled "One Heart at a Time", which charted at No.&nbsp;56 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Also that year, [[Trisha Yearwood]] recorded the song "Where Your Road Leads", which Shaw co-wrote and originally recorded on ''In Full View''. Yearwood's rendition of the song, which was recorded as a duet with Brooks, served as the title track to her 1998 album ''[[Where Your Road Leads]]'', from which it was released as a single.

After exiting Reprise in 1998, Shaw released her third album, ''Old Friends, New Memories'', in 2001 on the Taffeta label. This album included her renditions of the songs that she had written for other artists. In the mid-2000s, Shaw returned to songwriting as well. She has won two [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], in both 1999 and 2000, for co-writing songs for the daytime dramas [[One Life to Live]] and [[As the World Turns]].<ref>{{cite web | year = 2009 | url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1829395/awards| title = Awards for Victoria Shaw (III) | publisher = imdb.com | access-date = February 10, 2020}}</ref> Two of her songs, [[Emerson Drive]]'s "[[A Good Man (song)|A Good Man]]" and [[Eric Church]]'s "[[Two Pink Lines]]", both charted in 2006. She and [[Paul Worley]] co-produced [[Lady A]]'s self-titled [[Lady Antebellum (album)|debut album]], which was released in April 2008. Later that same year, Shaw released her fourth album, ''Bring On the Love''. Shaw also produced [[Jessie Farrell]]'s second album, ''[[Good, Bad & Pretty Things]]'', which was released in Canada in October 2009. In addition, she co-wrote [[Sarah Buxton (singer)|Sarah Buxton]]'s "Outside My Window."

As part of the show ''[[Property Brothers: At Home on the Ranch]]'', show hosts [[Drew Scott|Drew]] and [[Jonathan Scott (reality TV)|Jonathan Scott]]—along with Victoria Shaw and Chad Carlson—wrote and recorded two country singles that premiered during the third and fourth episode of the series.<ref name=Freshen>{{cite press release | title =HGTV'S Scott Brothers Freshen Up a Family Farm in 'Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch' | publisher =Scripps Network Interactive | date =October 28, 2015 | url =http://newsroom.scrippsnetworksinteractive.com/news/hgtv/hgtvs-scott-brothers-freshen-up-family-farm-in-property-brothers-at-home-on-ranch.htm | access-date =March 3, 2017 | archive-date =March 4, 2017 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170304041333/http://newsroom.scrippsnetworksinteractive.com/news/hgtv/hgtvs-scott-brothers-freshen-up-family-farm-in-property-brothers-at-home-on-ranch.htm | url-status =dead }}</ref>
