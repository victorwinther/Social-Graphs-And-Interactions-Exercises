'''Thomas Bradley Cotter''' (born September 29, 1970) is an American [[country music]] singer who won the 2004 season of ''[[Nashville Star]]'' a talent competition on the [[USA Network]]. Signed to [[Epic Records]] that year, he released his debut album ''[[Patient Man]]'', which produced three singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, including the No.&nbsp;35 "I Meant To". An independent EP, ''Continuity'', followed in 2007.

==Biography==
Born in [[Opelika, Alabama]], Cotter trained with Jerry Redd, who had performed with [[Elvis Presley]] and the [[gospel music]] group The Stamps Quartet. His first public performance was at the age of nine in a church in [[Columbus, Georgia]].  He recorded five gospel records in the next eight years, and was voted the "top child Gospel soloist in America". He dropped out of performing in his late teen years, then returned to music in Auburn, where he joined the group Silverado.

Cotter left Silverado in 1993 and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he tried to get work as a solo act and a songwriter, landing cuts by [[Tommy Shane Steiner]] and [[Chad Brock]], in addition to recording demos.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p660647/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Brad Cotter biography|last=Jeffries|first=David|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=June 4, 2009}}</ref> He later competed on and won ''[[Nashville Star]]'', then signed to a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]. Cotter's debut album ''[[Patient Man]]'' was released in mid-2004 via Epic, with production by songwriter Steve Bogard. This album produced three chart singles on the country charts, including the Top 40 "I Meant To", but Cotter exited the label before Epic closed its Nashville division in 2005. In 2007, Cotter signed with Adobe Road Records in Nashville, releasing an EP called ''Continuity''.

In 2009, Cotter and Bogard reunited, and Cotter signed to OMG Records. His second full album, ''Right on Time'', was released in June 2009.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Conaway|first=Alanna|date=June 15, 2009|title=Roller Coaster Ride: Brad Cotter has bounced back from tough times after winning ''Nashville Star''.|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=16|issue=18|pages=48}}</ref>
