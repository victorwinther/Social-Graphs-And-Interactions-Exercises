==Musical style==
According to Matt Bjorke of Roughstock, Big Smo is one of the foremost grassroots artists in a style known as [[rural rap]] or hick-hop, "which blends rural, Country themes and melodies with some rap elements (production and vocal delivery)".<ref name=roughstock>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/reviews/album-review-big-smo-kuntry-livin|title=Album Review: Big Smo - Kuntry Livin'|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|date=June 3, 2014|publisher=Roughstock|accessdate=June 24, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618220017/http://www.roughstock.com/reviews/album-review-big-smo-kuntry-livin|archivedate=June 18, 2014}}</ref> [[AllMusic]]'s Steve Legget commented that Big Smo "combines country themes and attitudes with rap and hip-hop in a style that prompted one reviewer to note 'If Kid Rock and Run–D.M.C. had a love child, he would be named Big Smo,' although combining Hank Williams Jr. with Nappy Roots might strike a bit closer."<ref name=am /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Big Smo as sounding like "If Run–D.M.C.'s 'Walk This Way' stomped out of Queens and ended up in the rural south."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=10 New Artists You Need to Know: June 2014|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-june-2014-20140619/big-smo-0538353|last=Murray|first=Nick|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 24, 2014|date=June 19, 2014}}</ref> The music on ''Kuntry Livin''' was described as spinning "rap rhymes about working-class values over hard-rock riffs."<ref name=usatoday>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/06/02/echo-bunnymen-big-smo-lp/9884569/|title=Listen Up: Other notable releases|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Mansfield|date=June 3, 2014|work=USA Today|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref>
