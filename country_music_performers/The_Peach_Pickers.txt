'''The Peach Pickers''' are an American [[songwriting]] team, composed of [[Rhett Akins]], [[Dallas Davidson]], and [[Ben Hayslip]].

Akins and Hayslip met while attending high school together in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], before Akins signed a contract with [[Decca Records]] in the mid-1990s. Davidson began songwriting in college, where he was roommates with singer [[Luke Bryan]] at Georgia Southern University.  He and Akins met in 2004 when the two co-wrote "Kiss My Country Ass", which both Akins and [[Blake Shelton]] recorded. After Akins brought Davidson to a songwriting session, the three began holding songwriting meetings every Wednesday.<ref name="peach">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.theboot.com/2011/01/31/peach-pickers-songs/ |title=Peach Pickers — Behind the Spotlight |publisher=Theboot.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2012/11/05/peach-pickers-success-from-peristent.html?page=all |title=Peach Pickers songwriting trio finds success with weekly quotas - Nashville Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2012-11-05 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> Among the songs that they have written together are Shelton's "[[All About Tonight (Blake Shelton song)|All About Tonight]]", [[Josh Turner]]'s "[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]", [[Jack Ingram]]'s "[[Barefoot and Crazy]]", [[Brooks & Dunn]]'s "[[Put a Girl in It]]", [[Joe Nichols]]' "[[Gimmie That Girl]]", and Bryan's "[[I Don't Want This Night to End]]".<ref name="row">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2012/11/the-insiders-view-the-peach-pickers/ |title=The Insider's View: The Peach Pickers : MusicRow – Nashville's Music Industry Publication – News, Songs From Music City |publisher=Musicrow.com |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> All three members of the team also have co-writers' credits outside their collaborations.<ref name="peach"/>
