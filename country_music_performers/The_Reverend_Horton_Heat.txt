He was influenced by [[country music]] artists such as [[Junior Brown]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Merle Travis]].

Adding bassist [[Jimbo Wallace]] and drummer [[Taz Bentley]] in 1989, Reverend Horton Heat recorded for [[Sub Pop]] at [[Reciprocal Recording]] in [[Seattle]] and Crystal Clear in [[Dallas]], which made up the majority of material on Reverend Horton Heat's debut album, ''[[Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em (The Reverend Horton Heat album)|Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em]]'' (1990).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jim Heath Is Reverend Horton Heat |url=https://tapeop.com/interviews/134/jim-heath-reverend-horton-heat/}}</ref> For their next album, the band recorded with [[Gibby Haynes]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] producing at [[Ardent Studios]] in Memphis: ''[[The Full-Custom Gospel Sounds of the Reverend Horton Heat]]'' (1993).

Heath has a signature guitar from the [[Gretsch]] Guitar company, the [[Gretsch 6120|6120RHH]].

His favorite amplifier was the [[Fender Super Reverb]] but is now the Gretsch Executive.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Heidt |first=John |date=April 2008 |title=Jim Heath: A Reverend By Any Other Name |journal=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]] |volume=22 |issue=6 |page=24}}</ref>
