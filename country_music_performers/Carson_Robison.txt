'''Carson Jay Robison''' ({{birth date|1890|8|4|mf=y}} – {{death date|1957|3|24|mf=y}})<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=349/350}}</ref> was an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. Although his impact is generally forgotten today, he played a major role in promoting country music in its early years through numerous recordings and radio appearances. He was also known as Charles Robison and sometimes composed under the pseudonym, Carlos B. McAfee.

==Early life==
Carson Jay Robison was born in [[Oswego, Kansas]], United States. His father was a champion fiddler; his mother played the piano and sang. Robison became a professional musician in the American Midwest at the age of 14, most notably as a backing musician for [[Victor Records]]'s [[Wendell Hall]] on the early 1920s music hall circuit.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He worked as a singer and [[Whistling|whistler]] at radio station [[WDAF-FM|WDAF]] ([[Kansas City, Missouri]]).

==Recording career==
In 1924, he moved to [[New York City]] and was signed to his first recording contract with the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]. Also that year, Robison started a professional collaboration with [[Vernon Dalhart]], one of the era's most notable singers.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  Through this relationship, Robison had success, mainly as a songwriter but also as a musician, accompanying Dalhart on guitar, harmonica, whistling, and harmony vocals.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In one of their first collaborations, Robison accompanied Dalhart on the landmark recording of "[[Wreck of the Old '97]]" b/w "[[The Prisoner's Song]]" (1924),<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> widely regarded as country music's first million-seller.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} During this period, Robison also became a successful composer of "event" songs, which recounted current events or tragedies in a predictable fashion, usually concluding in a moral lesson.  Some popular examples of his topical compositions include "The Wreck of the Shenandoah", ''[[Remember Pearl Harbor (slogan)|Remember Pearl Harbor]]'', "[[The Wreck of the Number Nine]]", and "The John T. Scopes Trial", about the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]].

Between 1927 and 1929 he also recorded with the Vernon Dalhart Trio, composed of  Robison, [[Vernon Dalhart]], and [[Adelyne Hood]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/5710164-Vernon-Dalhart-Trio?noanv=1 | title=Vernon Dalhart Trio | website=[[Discogs]] }}</ref>

In 1928, after Dalhart made a personnel change without consulting Robison, their relationship ended. Although the break up did not prove lucrative for either artist, Robison continued to record for decades to come. From 1928 to 1931 he teamed with [[Frank Luther]],<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> recording songs for various labels and appearing on WOR radio in New York City. In 1932, he started his own band, Carson Robison's Pioneers (later renamed The Buckaroos), and continued touring and recording through the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> It was during this period that Robison made some of the earliest tours of a country musician in [[Great Britain]],  appearing there in 1932, 1936, and 1938.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', his 1942 reworking of the standard "[[Turkey in the Straw]]", with new lyrics relating to [[World War II]], was that year's most popular song.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he appeared on the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. His most famous recording was 1948's "[[Life Gets Tee-Jus Don't It]]", a worldwide hit for MGM Records.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Although he played country music for most of his career, he is also remembered for writing expurgated lyrics for "[[Barnacle Bill (song)|Barnacle Bill the Sailor]]" with music by Frank Luther.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Also, in 1956, he wrote and recorded the novelty rock and roll song, "Rockin' and Rollin' With Grandmaw."<ref name = "allmusic">{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p22530/biography|pure_url=yes}} | last = Eder | first = Bruce | title = Carson Robison | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date = June 21, 2009}}</ref>

==Personal life ==
Robison was married twice.  His first wife was Rebecca. They had a son, Carson Donald Robison. Donald was raised by his grandmother after the untimely death of Rebecca from tuberculosis in her early 20s.  Eventually, both father and son settled in [[Pleasant Valley, New York]]. Donald had followed his father to this area to be close to New York City for his own career. During this time, Robison caught the eye of a young secretary working at the record label he was under contract to, Catherine "Catty".  Carson and Catty were married and had three children, Patricia, Robert, and Kenneth.
