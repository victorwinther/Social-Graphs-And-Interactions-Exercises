In 1994 Quartette released a self-titled album,<ref name=boro>[http://www.stalbertgazette.com/article/Quartette-brings-Christmas-to-Morinville-20151125 "Quartette brings Christmas to Morinville"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108190338/http://www.stalbertgazette.com/article/Quartette-brings-Christmas-to-Morinville-20151125 |date=2017-01-08 }}.

In 1995 and 1996 they were nominated for [[Juno Awards]] in the category of best country group.<ref Name=boro />

Peterson had toured and recorded with Quartette until early 1996, when she was diagnosed with cancer and was unable to perform with the band during her cancer treatment. She chose her friend and collaborator Gwen Swick to fill in for her,<ref>Ted Shaw, "Quartette copes with loss". ''[[Windsor Star]]'', December 14, 1996.</ref> and later died in Toronto on October 9 that year. She is interred in Little Lake Cemetery in Peterborough, Ontario.

All four current members of the group are also solo performers who have toured throughout Canada,<ref name="Inc.2000">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=Tyson album, stage show, draw on her life and long career in music|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aREEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|date=9 September 2000|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=60–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> having performed on ''[[Adrienne Clarkson Presents]]'' and at the [[Vancouver Folk Music Festival]]. 

Quartette's recordings and live performances have been reviewed favorably by ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]'' and ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''.

At the end of 2016, Quartette continued to perform live, completing a month-long tour in December.<ref>[https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/local-arts/a-quartette-christmas-with-sylvia-tyson-and-friends "A Quartette Christmas with Sylvia Tyson and friends"].
