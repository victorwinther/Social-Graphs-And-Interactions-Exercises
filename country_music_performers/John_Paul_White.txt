White is a co-owner of [[Single Lock Records]], which he founded in his hometown of Florence, Alabama, together with [[Ben Tanner]] (of the [[Alabama Shakes]]) and Florence financial consultant, Will Trapp.  The label has signed multiple artists from the Muscle Shoals area, including the legendary [[Donnie Fritts|"Funky" Donnie Fritts]], along with indie standouts like [[Lera Lynn]].  White often collaborates with the artists on the Single Lock label.

His album ''Beulah'' was released on August 19, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/06/09/481258114/songs-we-love-john-paul-white-the-martyr|title=Hear A Song From John Paul White's New Album, 'Beulah'|website=Npr.org|access-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref>

In 2017, White guested on the song "It Ain't Over Yet" with [[Rodney Crowell]] and [[Rosanne Cash]]. The track appeared on Crowell's album ''Close Ties''.

In 2018, White embarked on a house concert tour to get feedback on new material and in April 2019 released the album ''The Hurting Kind''. The album was a bit of a departure from White's Southern Rock and Americana roots, and was an intentional tribute to the country music he grew up listening to.  White co-wrote "I Wish I Could Write You a Song" with "Whispering" Bill Anderson, resulting in a distinctly Orbison feel on the track.  White toured in 2019 with several Single Lock artists, including acclaimed newcomer [[Erin Rae]].

In 2023, White and Williams individually participated in a [[Re-recording (music)|re-recording]] of "[[Safe & Sound (Taylor Swift song)|Safe & Sound]]" with [[Taylor Swift]], credited under their individual names.<ref>{{Cite web |last=MacCary |first=Julia |date=March 16, 2023 |title=Taylor Swift Is Dropping Four Unreleased Songs Ahead of Her Eras Tour Start |url=https://variety.com/2023/music/news/taylor-swift-unreleased-new-songs-eras-tour-1235556815/ |access-date=March 16, 2023 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref>
