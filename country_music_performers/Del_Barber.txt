Growing up in the [[St. Norbert, Winnipeg|St. Norbert]] neighbourhood of Winnipeg,<ref name=bioand2015junos/> he took up the guitar.

===''The Puck Drops Here'' and ''Easy Keeper'' (2016-2019)===
With ''Prairieography'' being dubbed as what could have been a career-making opus, Barber moved from Winnipeg to a farm in rural Manitoba to begin work on a follow-up album.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

On April 15, 2016; Barber along with the No Regretzkys released ''The Puck Drops Here'' through True North Records.<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/del_barber_and_the_no_regretzkys_lace_up_for_hockey-themed_lp_shoot_out_new_single|title=Del Barber & the No Regretzkys Lace Up for Hockey-themed LP, Shoot Out New Single|last=Murphy|first=Sarah|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>  With Barber being a hockey fan, this was a hockey themed album with distinct rock and country sounds.  Barber was in contact with True North sending them demos of songs he had been working on, but received no feedback.  Those songs would later be put on the album that would become ''Easy Keeper''. After not getting any feedback on those demos, Barber had the idea for a hockey themed album as it was never done before.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

It features covers of well-known songs such as [[Stompin' Tom Connors]]'s "[[The Hockey Song]]," ''Coach's Corner'' segment of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' theme "Flame of Victory," and [[Tom Cochrane]]'s "[[Big League (song)|Big League]]."  It also features covers of lesser known songs such as [[The Hanson Brothers]]' "Hockey Night Tonight" and [[The Pursuit of Happiness (band)|Pursuit of Happiness]]' "Gretzky Rocks."  Barber added some originals including "Hudson Bay Rules" and the single off the album "The Lights Go Out."<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere/>  The album was produced by [[Corb Lund]] guitarist Grant Siemens.<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere/>

Barber's refusal to promote the album led to tensions between himself and the label.  He was subsequently dropped by True North and his agent as a result.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

On June 10, 2018; Barber started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to raise money for his next album entitled ''Easy Keeper.''.<ref name=easykeeperkickstarter>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/248696342/easy-keeper-del-barbers-new-album/|title="Easy Keeper" - Del Barber's New Album!|date=June 10, 2018|work=Del Barber|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>  He stated that he took a hiatus and was now wanting to produce a new album.

<blockquote>"I wrote it before my dad passed—before he was even sick, but it became an anthem for me in the months after his passing.  Originally written from the perspective of Barber's neighbor who'd lost her husband, the song's interpretation of grief has such a universal quality that even Barber ended up applying to his own life, but maybe that was its purpose all along. "Looking back, I feel like this song was a gift from [my dad]."<ref name=thecountrynote/></blockquote>

The release date for ''Almanac'' was announced for April 28<ref name=holler>{{Cite web|url=https://holler.country/feature/premiere-del-barber-i-told-you-so|title=Del Barber - 'I told You So' Premiere|last=Owen|first=Jof|publisher=Holler|access-date=March 14, 2023}}</ref>  Barber wrote ''Almanac'' on his farm in Inglis, Manitoba which is 400&nbsp;km northwest of Winnipeg.  He recorded the album at No Fun Club in Winnipeg.  It took one week to record the album with Grant Siemens and Scott Franchuk.<ref name=thecountrynote/>

<blockquote>"It was a really beautiful session.  There were no grand intentions, just an aim to get good players and friends together and record a pile of my songs. Going into this session I really wanted to enjoy the process, not think too hard, and just keep it simple and honest. I had a group of great songs and I really didn't want to stand in their way."<ref name=thecountrynote/></blockquote>

==Contributions and collaborations==
Aside from his own solo work, he has writing credits on Blake Berglund and the Vultures 2014 album ''Jasper'' where he co-wrote the first six songs.  He also co-wrote "Funny Thing About You Leaving" with Berglund which is the B-side to Berglund's two-song single "Word's Gettin' Around" / "Funny Thing About You Leaving."
