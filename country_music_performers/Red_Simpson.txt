'''Joe Cecil''' "'''Red'''" '''Simpson''' (March 6, 1934 – January 8, 2016) was an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter best known for his [[trucker]][[truck-driving country|-themed]] country songs.

==Biography==
Joe Cecil Simpson<ref name=nytimes/><ref name= latimes/> was born in 1934 in [[Higley, Arizona]],<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/arts/music/red-simpson-singer-songwriter-who-helped-define-the-bakersfield-sound-dies-at-81.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fobituaries&action=click&contentCollection=obituaries&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront|title=Red Simpson, Who Made Trucks a Vehicle for the Bakersfield Sound, Dies at 81| last = Grimes | first = William|date = January 12, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}</ref> and was raised in [[Bakersfield]], California, the youngest of 12 children. At age 14, he wrote his first song. However, his father helped him listen to Ludwig van Beethoven.

Simpson was working at the Wagon Wheel in Lamont when Fuzzy Owen saw him and arranged for Simpson to work at his Clover Club as a piano player. He then got a job replacing [[Buck Owens]] at the Blackboard Club on weekends. Simpson was influenced by Owens, [[Merle Haggard]] and Bill Woods, who asked Red if he would write a song about driving trucks. (By the time Simpson handed him four truck songs, however, Woods had stopped recording.) Simpson began writing songs with Owens in 1962, including the Top Ten hit "Gonna Have Love".

In 1965, [[Capitol Records]] producer [[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]] was looking for someone to record some songs about trucking. His first choice was Haggard, who wasn't interested, but Simpson readily agreed. His first, [[Tommy Collins (country music)|Tommy Collins]]' "Roll, Truck, Roll", became a Top 40 country hit and Simpson recorded an album of the same name. That year he offered up two more trucking songs, both of which made it to the Top 50 or beyond. As a songwriter, he scored his first number one hit with "[[Sam's Place]]", recorded by Buck Owens. After that, Simpson decided to become a full-time writer. He returned to performing in 1971 with his Top Five hit "I'm a Truck", which had been written by postman Bob Staunton.

In 1972, he debuted on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and had two more "truck" hits for Capitol. In 1976, Simpson signed to [[Warner Brothers]] and released "Truck Driver's Heaven". The following year, he teamed up with Lorraine Walden for a series of duets that included "Truck Driver Man and Wife". In 1979, Simpson appeared for the last time on the charts with "The Flying Saucer Man and the Truck Driver". Haggard recorded his song "Lucky Old Colorado" in 1988. Later that year Simpson was diagnosed with skin cancer and underwent surgery. He fully recovered and continued his writing and performing career.

In the 1995, Red re-entered the studio to record a pair of duets with [[Junior Brown]]{{snd}} "Semi Crazy" and "Nitro Express".

Simpson performed frequently in the Bakersfield area, including a regular Monday night gig at Trout's in Oildale. Simpson's last release was "Hey, Bin Laden". He was also working on a project with Windsor Music tentatively entitled ''The Bard of Bakersfield''.

Simpson also appeared alongside Bakersfield business owner Gene Thome on his ode to Simpson, Haggard, and Owens "It's a Bakersfield Thing" released in early 2015.

Red Simpson died on January 8, 2016, at a hospital in Bakersfield, after suffering complications from a heart attack. He was 81.<ref name= latimes>{{cite news|last= Leovy |first= Jill |title= Red Simpson dies at 81; musician's trucker songs helped drive the Bakersfield sound |url= http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-red-simpson-20160114-story.html |accessdate=October 3, 2016|newspaper =[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mayer |first=Steven |url=http://www.bakersfield.com/news/breaking-news/2016/01/08/bakersfield-sound-pioneer-red-simpson-dies-at-81.html |title=Bakersfield Sound pioneer Red Simpson dies at 81 – The Bakersfield Californian |website=Bakersfield.com |date= January 8, 2016 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name=TasteOfCountry>{{cite web|last= Whitaker |first=Sterling |title= Country Music Pioneer Red Simpson Dead at 81 |url= http://tasteofcountry.com/red-simpson-dead-dies/|accessdate=October 3, 2016|newspaper =Taste Of Country |date=January 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name=RollingStone>{{cite news|last= Hudak |first= Joseph |title= 'Truck Driver' Singer Red Simpson Dead at 81 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/truck-driver-singer-red-simpson-dead-at-81-20160109 |accessdate=October 3, 2016|newspaper =[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 9, 2016}}</ref>
