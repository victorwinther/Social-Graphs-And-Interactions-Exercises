==Biography==

===Music career===
Mahood has been building her profile in the music scene throughout Canada and the United States since her debut album, ''[[Girl Out of the Ordinary]]'', was released in 1998. The album garnered multiple radio singles and music videos. She signed with [[143 Records]], a record label owned by record producer David Foster. With Foster, she was part of the female trio, [[Lace (band)|Lace]], releasing an album, ''[[Lace (album)|Lace]]'', in 1999. The first single, "I Want a Man", went to number 7 on the charts in Canada and was a number one video on CMT's ''Chevy Top 20''. A second solo CD, ''Moody Blue'', was released in 2004, receiving recognition with another number one CMT video for the single "The First Day You Wake Up Alone."

In addition to her own recorded material, Mahood co-wrote the hit single "Come to Me," recorded by [[Celine Dion]] on her 2005 ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]'' album. She also wrote "Good to Be Alive," the theme for the CMT reality series' ''Project Mother'' and ''Project Dad'', which was released to radio in 2007 with an accompanying music video airing on CMT. In May 2008, Mahood marked her return as a recording artist with the release of the song, "This Girl." A second single, "Rewrite History," was released in October 2008. Mahood's new album, ''Unmistakable'', was released on 18 November 2008. Her most recent Christmas album, ''This Christmas Celebrate Me Home'', was released on 4 November 2008. In May 2013, Mahood released a new single, "Hope & Gasoline," to Canadian country radio.  Mahood's fourth album was released on 12 November 2013. The album was re-released in 2017 as "New Religion" with extra tracks.

===Acting career===
In 2006, Mahood contributed her name and image to the Bootlegger Jean print campaign with her image appearing in stores across North America. As an actress, she has performed in ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' (2004), the stage production ''Heartthrobs'' (2003) and ''Castle Rocks'' ([[Lorraine Kimsa Theatre for Young People|Young People's Theatre]], 1998).

Mahood also sings the Telemiracle theme song "Thank You", which has been that telethon's theme since 2021.

She also performed at The Bohemian Ball in [[Toronto]] on 20 February 2009. The 2009 Bohemian Ball, organised by the Canada Czech Republic Chamber of Commerce, was held in support of the SickKids Foundation and the Hospital for Sick Children.

Mahood is a supporter of the following initiatives: the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Alberta's Children's Hospital, the David Foster Foundation and the CIBC Run for the Cure. She is also the spokesperson for the Pink Mitten Campaign, which raises money for breast cancer research, education and awareness programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinkmitten.com/|title=Pink Mitten – Geek Chic for the Win!|website=Pinkmitten.com|access-date=29 October 2021}}</ref>
