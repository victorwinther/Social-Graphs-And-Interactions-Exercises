'''Thomas James Hunter''', [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Order of Ontario|O.Ont]] (born March 20, 1937) is a Canadian [[country music]] performer, known as "Canada's Country Gentleman".

==Career==
In 1956, he began performing as a rhythm guitarist on the [[CBC Television]] show, ''[[Country Hoedown]]''. ''The Tommy Hunter Show'' began as a [[CBC Radio]] program in 1960, replacing the long-running variety show ''[[The Happy Gang]]'', and went on to replace ''Country Hoedown'' on CBC Television in 1965; Hunter's show was picked up by [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] in 1983 and ran on CBC until 1992. Performers on the show included singer-songwriter [[Gordon Lightfoot]] in the early years of his own musical career. 

The book ''Cue the Elephant'' by [[Knowlton Nash]] (1996, McClelland & Stewart) featured some disparaging remarks from the show's make-up artist. "He could sell himself terrifically but there was no love lost between Tommy and the crew. Some of the guys loathed him ... Everybody made snide remarks behind Tommy's back ... people might say he was the biggest jerk in the world. But that was not my experience. For me, I saw a very easy down-to-earth manner. But Tommy does generate anti as well as pro feelings from people ... he didn't trust people around him, he became a monster to some."

People who performed on ''The Tommy Hunter Show'' early in their careers include:
*[[Garth Brooks]]
*[[Shania Twain]], then known as Eileen Twain
*[[The Judds]]
