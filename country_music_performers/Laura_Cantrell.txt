Cantrell moved to New York City from her native Nashville to study English at [[Columbia University]]. She briefly recorded songs with future [[Superchunk]] guitarist [[Mac McCaughan]] and others in a [[lo-fi]] band called [[Bricks (band)|Bricks]] and deejaying on the university's radio station, [[WKCR]], until joining [[WFMU]] after her graduation in 1993.

Her singing career began when she was at college, performing with various local groups. She later befriended [[John Flansburgh]] of [[They Might Be Giants]], with whom she sings on the band's ''[[Apollo 18 (album)|Apollo 18]]'' (1992). Flansburgh also released her first solo material: an [[Extended play|EP]] on his "Hello CD of the Month Club" in June 1996, which was reissued in 2004 as ''The Hello Recordings''.
