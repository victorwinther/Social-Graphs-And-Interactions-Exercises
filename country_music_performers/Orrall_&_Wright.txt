'''Orrall & Wright''' was an American [[country music]] duo composed of [[Robert Ellis Orrall]] and [[Curtis Wright]]. Both members had recorded solo albums and had charted singles of their own prior to Orrall & Wright's inception. As Orrall & Wright, they charted two more singles and recorded a self-titled album on the [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant]] label.

Unlike most other country music duos present at the time, Orrall & Wright's members shared lead vocals on every song that they recorded.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |date=July 1994 |title=New Traditions: Orrall & Wright |journal=New Country |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=16 |issn=1074-536X}}</ref> Although active for only one year, they received a Duo of the Year nomination from the [[Country Music Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Robert_Ellis_Orrall.html |title=Robert Ellis Orrall |accessdate=2008-01-04 |work=Peer Music |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213154054/http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Robert_Ellis_Orrall.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472579/20030612/bellamy_brothers.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023836/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472579/20030612/bellamy_brothers.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=They Vocal Duo Dilemma: They Also Serve Those Who Also Ran |accessdate=2008-01-04 |last=Morris |first=Edward |date=2000-08-10 |work=[[Country Music Television]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cmaawards.net/2007/database/ByYear.aspx?year=1994 |title=Awards Database - 1994 |accessdate=2008-01-04 |work=[[Country Music Association]]}}</ref> By the end of 1994, both members resumed their solo careers.
