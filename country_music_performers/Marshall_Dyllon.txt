'''Marshall Dyllon''' was an American [[country music]] group formed in 2000, comprising vocalists Daniel Cahoon, Jesse Littleton, Michael Martin, Paul Martin, and Todd Michael Sansom. These five members were recruited by country music artist [[Kenny Rogers]] and talent manager [[Lou Pearlman]], in an attempt to bring the [[boy band]] sound to the country music scene.

Excluding Kenny Rogers himself, Marshall Dyllon was the first act to be signed to Dreamcatcher Records, an independent label which Rogers owned. The group's singular album, ''[[Enjoy the Ride (Marshall Dyllon album)|Enjoy the Ride]]'', was released that year. It accounted for the chart singles "Live It Up" and "You". The band released a third single, "[[She Ain't Gonna Cry]]", in 2001 before disbanding.
