==Personal life==

Brad and MaryLynne met when they were age 20.  The married couple has been together for sixteen years playing in bands and writing [[country pop]] music.

Brad played bass in rock bands for years, but was drawn to writing country. MaryLynne had never written songs until she met Brad. She grew up one of eight kids, which her late father supported as a musician (he was once a member of [[The Platters]]).

MaryLynne and Brad both performed in cover bands and hosted a weekly open mic where they eventually became a musical duo.  The couple also opened a 15,000-square-foot music school, The Music Scene, which included a stage and auditorium.<ref>[https://www.durhamregion.com/whatson-story/3480305-music-scene-owners-turn-heads-in-nashville/ "Music Scene owners turn heads in Nashville"].

Brad and MaryLynne have two daughters, [[Lennon Stella|Lennon]] and [[Maisy Stella|Maisy]], who are known for their roles on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]''.

==Career==

In 2009, The Stellas tried out for the U.S. show ''[[Can You Duet]]'', performing songs by [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]].  Following their audition for the [[Country Music Television]] show, The Stellas performed weekly for millions of American viewers and earned fourth place in the competition.<ref name="leaderpost" />  This led fellow Canadian and multi-platinum artist, [[Johnny Reid]], to offer The Stellas the opening slot on his sold-out Canadian tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Stellas on CBC Music|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/The-Stellas|website=[[CBC Music]]|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref>  Eventually, Brad and MaryLynne signed a deal with [[EMI|EMI Music Canada]].  In 2012, they released their self-titled album, which was produced by Britain's Nick Trevisick ([[Paramore]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]).  The Stellas wrote most of the songs on their 10-track [[The Stellas (album)|self-titled debut album]], except for a cover of [[Fairground Attraction]]'s “[[Perfect (Fairground Attraction song)|Perfect]]” and a live version of [[Boudleaux Bryant]]'s “[[Love Hurts]]”.

Collaborations on the album include Trevisick on “Take It Slow”, [[Pistol Annies]]’ [[Angaleena Presley]] on “I Can’t Listen to Love Songs” and multi-platinum Nashville songwriter [[John Scott Sherrill]] ([[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Willie Nelson]]) on “Wished for You”.

The Stellas were featured on volume 6 and volume 7 of the ''Now Country'' Canada albums. They are one of the two Canadian acts featured on those albums. They are also featured on ''The Best of Now Country'' Canada album that came out in May 2014.

The Stellas have supported multiple sold-out tours with [[Zac Brown Band]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Stellas Tour Dates|url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/37370-stellas|website=[[Songkick]]|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> Zac Brown recorded and released a song called "Let It Rain" that he wrote with Brad for his EP ''[[The Grohl Sessions, Vol. 1]]'' (released in 2013). It is the only song on that album that [[Dave Grohl]] plays drums on.

In July 2014, The Stellas released "Gravy", a blend of twang and tongue-in-cheek humor that doubles as the first single from the duo's second album. Fred Wilhelm, who helped The Stellas write "Gravy", co-wrote several other songs, including a track called "It Wouldn't Be This".

==Awards==

The Stellas have been nominated for eleven awards.  They won the 2013 [[Canadian Country Music Association|CCMA]] Group or Duo of the Year award,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Stephanie|title=2013 CCMA Award winners The Stellas credit their Ontario music roots|url=http://cmaontario.ca/newsletter/2013/09/2013-ccma-award-winners-the-stellas-credit-their-ontario-music-roots/|accessdate=July 30, 2014|work=Country Music Association of Ontario|date=September 26, 2013}}</ref> the 2013 CMAO Group or Duo of the Year award<ref>{{cite web|title=2013 CMAO Award Winners|url=http://cmaontario.ca/2013-awards-winners|website=Country Music Association of Ontario|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> and the 2012 CCMA Video of the Year award.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Van Evra|first1=Jennifer|title=2012 Canadian Country Music Awards - Winners List|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2012/9/2012-Canadian-Country-Music-Awards---Winners-List|accessdate=July 30, 2014|work=[[CBC Music]]|date=September 9, 2012}}</ref>  Brad has also been nominated for the Glenn Cole Award, RCTA, JUNOES, and RIAA awards.
