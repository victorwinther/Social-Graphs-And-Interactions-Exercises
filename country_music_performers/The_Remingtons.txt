'''The Remingtons''' were an American [[country music]] group founded in 1991. They consisted of guitarists and vocalists [[Jimmy Griffin]], Richard Mainegra, and Rick Yancey. Griffin was previously a member of the [[soft rock]] group [[Bread (band)|Bread]], while Mainegra and Yancey had previously been part of another soft rock group called [[Cymarron]]. Yancey left in 1992 and was replaced by Denny Henson. The band recorded two albums for [[BNA Records]] (then known as BNA Entertainment) and charted five country singles, including the number 10 "[[A Long Time Ago (song)|A Long Time Ago]]." The Remingtons broke up in 1993 and all four members continued in other projects.
