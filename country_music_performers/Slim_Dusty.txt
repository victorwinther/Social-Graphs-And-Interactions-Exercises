Slim Dusty "released more than a hundred albums, selling more than seven million records and earning over 70 gold and platinum album certifications". He was the first Australian to have a No.&nbsp;1 international hit song, with a version of [[Gordon Parsons (singer-songwriter)|Gordon Parsons]]' "[[A Pub with No Beer]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aso.gov.au/titles/music/a-pub-with-no-beer/notes/|title=Curator's notes A Pub With No Beer (1957) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online|website=Aso.gov.au|access-date=28 October 2019}}</ref> He received 38 [[Golden Guitar]]s and an [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) award.

In 2007, his domestic record sales in Australia surpassed seven million. During his lifetime, Dusty was considered an [[Australian National Living Treasure|Australian National Treasure]]. He performed "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", a very famous song in Australia, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]].

==Family and career==
===Childhood and early career===
David Gordon Kirkpatrick was born on 13 June 1927 in Nulla Nulla Creek west of [[Kempsey, New South Wales]], the son of a cattle farmer. His childhood home, "[[Homewood, Bellbrook|Homewood]]", survives and is now heritage-listed. He was known by his middle name, Gordon. He wrote his first song, "The Way the Cowboy Dies", in 1937 and adopted the stage name "Slim Dusty" in 1938 at age 11.<ref>"Senior Australian of the Year", 1999 award by the Australian government. Retrieved 10 March 2008.</ref> His earliest musical influences included American [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], New Zealander [[Tex Morton]], and Australia's [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]]. In 1945, Dusty wrote "[[When the Rain Tumbles Down in July]]" and released his first record that year at age 18. In 1946, he signed his first recording contract with Columbia Graphophone for the Regal Zonophone label.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/21/1063625259334.html "Slim Dusty: The boy who lived his dream"], ''The Age'' (Australia), 21 September 2003</ref>

===Influential wife, and children===
[[File:Cunnamulla Fella.JPG|thumb|Statue of the "[[Cunnamulla Fella]]" erected as a tribute to songwriter [[Stan Coster]] and Slim Dusty]]
In 1951, Dusty married singer-songwriter [[Joy McKean]] and, with her help, achieved great success around Australia. In 1954, the two launched a full-time business career, including the Slim Dusty Travelling Show. McKean was Dusty's wife and manager for over 50 years. 

McKean's sister Heather, half of the McKean Sisters music duo that preceded Joy's association with Dusty, was married to Australian country singer [[Reg Lindsay]], before separating and later divorcing in the 1980s, whereupon the McKean sisters re-started their music duo.

Together Dusty and Joy McKean had two children, [[Anne Kirkpatrick]] and David Kirkpatrick, who are also accomplished singer-songwriters.<ref name="slimdusty.com.au">{{cite web |url=http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |title=News |publisher=Slim Dusty |access-date=10 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430142753/http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |archive-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>

===Dusty hits written by Joy McKean===
McKean wrote several of Dusty's most popular songs, including "[[Lights On The Hill]]", "Walk a Country Mile", "Indian Pacific", "Kelly's Offsider", "The Angel of Goulburn Hill" and "[[The Biggest Disappointment]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |title=The Country Music Store – Slim Dusty Sings Joy McKean |publisher=Store.countrymusic.com.au |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-date=30 August 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830034755/http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Other songwriters' contributions===
Although himself an accomplished writer of songs, Dusty had a number of other songwriters, including Mack Cormack, [[Gordon Parsons (singer-songwriter)|Gordon Parsons]], [[Stan Coster]], and Kelly Dixon, who were typically short on formal education but big on personal experience of the [[Australian bush]]. Drawing on his travels and such writers over a span of decades, Dusty chronicled the story of a rapidly changing postwar Australian nation.

===First megahit===
Dusty's 1957 hit "[[A Pub with No Beer]]" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go gold and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc.<ref name="Guardian-obit">Dave Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries "Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003</ref> (The "Pub with No Beer" is a real place, in [[Taylors Arm, New South Wales|Taylors Arm]], not far from Kempsey, where Slim was born.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/north_coast_pub.htm|title=North Coast: The Pub With No Beer|publisher=[[NRMA]]|access-date=13 June 2008}}</ref> In 1959 and 1960, Dutch and German cover versions of the song became number one hits (even evergreens) in Belgium, Austria and Germany, brought by the Flemish country singer-guitarist and amusement park founder [[Bobbejaan Schoepen]].
In 1964 the annual Slim Dusty Australia-round tour, a {{Convert|48280|km|mi|0}} journey that went on for ten months, was started. This regular event was the subject of a feature film, ''[[The Slim Dusty Movie]]'', in 1984.

===Contributions of other songwriters===
Dusty recorded not only songs written by himself and other fellow Australian performers but also classic Australian poems by [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]], with new tunes to call attention to the old "bush ballads". An example is "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]" by Paterson. The 1980 album and songs ''The Man Who Steadies the Lead'' and ''The Pearl of Them All'' were the works of Paterson's rival for the title of Australia's bush balladeer, Scottish-Australian poet [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H. Ogilvie]] (1869–1963). In 1970, Dusty was made a member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] for services to music.<ref>[https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1084733 It's an Honour] – Member of the Order of the British Empire</ref>

==Awards and honors==
In 1973, Dusty won Best Single at the inaugural [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] at the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] (McKean won Song of the Year as writer of "[[Lights on the Hill (song)|Lights on the Hill]]"). By March 1976, Dusty had achieved 37 gold and two platinum records, more than any other Australian artist.<ref name="aus76">{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1976-03-13.pdf|title=Slim Dusty Inks Huge EMI Deal |magazine=[[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]]|via=World Radio History|page=55|date=13 March 1976|access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref>

Dusty and his wife were patrons of the National Truck Drivers' Memorial, located in [[Tarcutta]], New South Wales.

The general manager of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Bob Whitaker, invited Dusty and his wife to perform in 1997, recognising 50 years of contributing to country music. 

The following January, Dusty was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] for his service to the entertainment industry.<ref>[https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/870179 It's an Honour] – Officer of the Order of Australia</ref>

Dusty recorded and released his 100th album, ''Looking Forward, Looking Back'', in 2000 and became the first artist in worldwide commercial recording history to do so; second was [[Cliff Richard]]. All 100 albums were recorded with the same record label, EMI, making Dusty the first music artist in the world to record 100 albums with the same label.<ref name="nla.gov.au">{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-destra+Media~76AE0801-0FCD-4334-A8D0-86AA829BE178 |title=Music Australia – Slim Dusty |publisher=Nla.gov.au |date=3 April 2007 |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-date=29 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165046/http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-destra+Media~76AE0801-0FCD-4334-A8D0-86AA829BE178 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Country gospel music interest==
[[Slim Dusty discography|Dusty's repertoire]] included [[country gospel]] music, with which he liked to finish his shows.<ref>Per narration by Slim Dusty, ''Slim Dusty Live at Wagga Wagga''; Track 12, 1972</ref> His live albums usually carried the theme, and in 1971 he released the Gospel album ''Glory Bound Train'' featuring the eponymous hit ''Glory Bound Train'' and other songs of a Christian theme. ''Glory Bound Train'' was in turn the song selected to conclude the tribute concert held at Tamworth after his death. The "Concert for Slim" was recorded live on 20 January 2004, at the Tamworth Regional Entertainment Centre, and an all-star cast of Australian musicians sang out the show with Slim's ''Glory Bound Train''. The DVD was certified 3× Platinum in Australia.<ref name=ARIACert05>{{cite certification|region=Australia|artist=Various Artists|type=video|certyear=2005|access-date=17 December 2021}}</ref>

==Death==
Dusty died at his home in [[St Ives, New South Wales]], on 19 September 2003 at the age of 76 after a protracted battle with [[lung cancer|lung]] and [[kidney cancer]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/19/1063625203882.html "Slim Dusty dies"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 19 September 2003</ref>

Eminent figures, including the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Howard]], and the federal opposition leader, [[Simon Crean]], attended a [[state funeral]] at [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney]] on 26 September 2003, where thousands had gathered. In the funeral, the Anglican Dean of Sydney, [[Phillip Jensen]] paid tribute by leading the congregation of family, statesmen, fans and musicians in the singing of "A Pub With No Beer". Several tributes were featured from Dusty's children as well as words from other national musicians ([[Peter Garrett]] and [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]) and music from [[Graeme Connors]], [[Kasey Chambers]] and [[Troy Cassar-Daley]]. Around Australia, thousands of fans gathered to stand outside the cathedral; Dusty was later cremated.

Dusty had been working on his 106th album for EMI at the time of his death. On 8 March 2004 the album, ''[[Columbia Lane – the Last Sessions]]'', debuted at number five in the Australian album charts and number one on the country charts. Gold status was achieved after being on sale for less than two weeks.

''Columbia Lane'' is a tribute to the laneway juxtaposed to [[Parramatta Road]] in [[Strathfield]] (near the railway bridge link), where the EMI studios once stood (now a [[Kennards Self Storage]] store), and where he began his music career.
