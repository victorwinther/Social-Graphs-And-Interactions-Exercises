The '''Wilburn Brothers''' were an American [[country music]] duo from the 1950s to the 1970s, consisting of brothers '''Virgil Doyle Wilburn''' (1930–1982)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=447/8}}</ref> and '''Thurman Theodore''' "'''Teddy'''" '''Wilburn''' (1931<ref name="LarkinCountry" />–2003).<ref name="Independent" />

== Biography ==
The brothers were born in [[Hardy, Arkansas]].<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> They first attracted attention as child performers, beginning in 1937, in an act called The Wilburn Children;<ref name=d17>Diekman 2007, p.&nbsp;17.</ref> [[Roy Acuff]] discovered them and brought them to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1940.<ref>''Billboard'', February 17, 1968, Nielsen Business Media, p.&nbsp;30</ref> Due to federal [[child labor laws]], the Wilburns were forced to leave the Opry after six months.<ref name="LarkinCountry" />

After growing up, they continued to travel and were regulars on the similar ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' program in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] from 1948<ref name=h177>Hefley 1992, p.&nbsp;177.</ref> until 1951. After the family act disbanded, and the brothers served stints in the [[United States Army|US Army]] during the [[Korean War]], they continued in 1953 as The Wilburn Brothers touring with [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]].<ref name=c429>Carlin 2003, p.&nbsp;429.</ref> They signed with [[Decca Records]] in May 1954,<ref>''Billboard'', May 28, 1966, Nielsen Business Media, p.&nbsp;6</ref> and had their first hit record the same year, backing [[Webb Pierce]], on "Sparkling Brown Eyes."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/78rpm/record/29107|title=78 Record: Webb Pierce – Even Tho (1954)|access-date=August 11, 2021|website=45worlds.com}}</ref> Other notable hits include "Go Away With Me" (1956), "Which One Is To Blame" (1959), "Trouble's Back In Town" (1962), "It's Another World" (1965), and "Hurt Her Once For Me" (1967).<ref name="LarkinCountry" />

In 1956, the Wilburns were offered the chance to record "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]" before [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="Ace">{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Ace|title=Untold Gold: The Stories Behind Elvis's No.&nbsp;1 Hits|year=2005|publisher=Souvenir Press Ltd|isbn=978-0-285-63738-2|pages=10–18}}</ref> After hearing the song they decided against recording it, describing it as "strange and almost morbid".<ref name="Ace" />

In addition to being successful artists, the Wilburns formed the Sure-Fire Music Publishing Company (with [[Don Helms]]) in 1957,<ref name=bm91>Bush, Mitchell 2007, p.&nbsp;91.</ref> as well as  the Wil-Helm Talent Agency in the early 1960s.<ref name=c429 /> They were instrumental in launching the careers of many country musicians, most notably [[Loretta Lynn]],<ref name=e175>Ellison 1995, p.&nbsp;175.</ref> whom they signed to their music publishing company. Lynn was the "girl singer" of the Wilburns' touring show between 1960 and 1968,<ref name=hf637>Hoffman, Ferstler 2004, p.&nbsp;637.</ref> and she made weekly appearances on their syndicated television show from 1963 to 1971.<ref name=e175 /> They also helped develop the career of [[Patty Loveless]] between 1973 and 1975, by having her tour with them on weekends and during school breaks.

The Wilburn Brothers had a [[television syndication|syndicated]] television program, ''The Wilburn Brothers Show'',<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> that ran from 1963 to 1974, with 354 half-hour episodes produced. Reruns can still be seen on the cable network [[RFD-TV]] and in the UK on [[Rural TV]]. They were Opry members from 1953 until the time of Doyle's death from lung cancer on October 16, 1982 (at age 52).<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> Teddy continued with the Opry as a solo artist,<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> until his death on November 24, 2003, of congestive heart failure, just six days before his 72nd birthday.<ref name="Independent">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/teddy-wilburn-5547071.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220620/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/teddy-wilburn-5547071.html |archive-date=June 20, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Teddy Wilburn|date=December 2, 2003|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=August 11, 2021}}</ref>

They are both buried in the [[Nashville National Cemetery]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].
