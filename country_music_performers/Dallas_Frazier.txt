==Life and career==
Frazier was born in [[Spiro, Oklahoma]], on October 27, 1939,<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=146/7}}</ref> but was raised in [[Bakersfield, California]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> As a teenager, he played with [[Ferlin Husky]] and on the program ''[[Hometown Jamboree]]''; and released his first single, "Space Command", at age 14 in 1954.<ref name=allmusic/> As he told writer Edd Hurt in a 2008 profile for the music website [[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]], "We were part of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. We were the Okies who went out to California with mattresses tied on the tops of their Model A Fords. My folks were poor. At twelve I moved away from home, with my folks' permission. Ferlin [Husky] offered me a job, and I started working with him when I was twelve. Then I recorded a side for [[Capitol Records]] when I was fourteen, and I did some country. I cut in the big circular building that's still out there on Hollywood and Vine."

Frazier's 1957 song "[[Alley Oop (song)|Alley Oop]]", later taken to No. 1 in the US by [[The Hollywood Argyles]], was his first hit.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After ''Hometown Jamboree'' went off the air, Frazier moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and found work as a songwriter. Among his early successes was "Timber I'm Falling", a hit for Husky in 1964, and "[[There Goes My Everything (song)|There Goes My Everything]]", a big hit for [[Jack Greene]] in 1966,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> that earned him a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]].

In 1966, he released his solo debut album ''Elvira'', containing his song "[[Elvira (song)|Elvira]]". His follow-up, ''Tell It Like It Is'' (1967), was also a success.<ref name=allmusic/>

While his singing success was limited, Frazier became an oft-covered songwriter.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His tunes were recorded by [[O.C. Smith]], [[George Jones]] (who recorded [[Sings the Songs of Dallas Frazier|an entire album]] of Frazier's songs in 1968), [[Diana Ross]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Jack Greene]], [[Connie Smith]] (who also recorded an [[If It Ain't Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs|entire album]] of Frazier's songs in 1972), [[Willie Nelson]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Carola Standertskjöld|Carola]], [[Charley Pride]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Gene Watson]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Moe Bandy]], [[Roy Head]], [[Charlie Louvin]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Dan McCafferty]], [[Poco]] and [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. In 1970, Frazier earned his second [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]], which is awarded to the songwriter rather than the performer, for "[[All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)]], which became a No. 1 hit for [[Charley Pride]]. Many of the songs became hits into the 1980s; examples include the [[Oak Ridge Boys]] cover of "[[Elvira (song)|Elvira]]" and [[Emmylou Harris]]'s version of "Beneath Still Waters".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The cover of "Elvira" by the Oak Ridge Boys was a crossover hit, peaking at No. 1 on Billboard's [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles and Tracks]] chart and No. 5 on the all genre [[Billboard Hot 100]]; and earned Frazier his third Grammy nomination for Best Country song. [[Anne Murray]] with [[Glen Campbell]], [[George Strait]], [[Randy Travis]], and [[Patty Loveless]] have all also recorded Frazier tunes.<ref name=allmusic/> Frazier himself charted eight times on the U.S. country chart. He was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1976.

In 1988, Frazier left the music industry and became a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]].<ref name=allmusic/> Frazier suffered two strokes in late 2021, and died from related complications at a care facility in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], on January 14, 2022, at the age of 82.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/16/arts/music/dallas-frazier-dead.html|title = Dallas Frazier, Who Wrote Hits for Country Stars, Dies at 82|last = Friskics-Warren|first = Bill|date = January 16, 2022|accessdate = January 16, 2022|work = [[The New York Times]]|url-access = limited}}</ref>
