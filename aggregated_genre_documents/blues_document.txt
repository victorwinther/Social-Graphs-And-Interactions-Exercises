===Country music with Warner Brothers===
Al Downing's popularity continued to grow, and he had several hits on the country charts between 1978 and 1989. He compiled a list of his own songs, which he presented to his producer at Warner Brothers. In 1978, "Mr. Jones" reached the Top 20, followed by "Touch Me (I'll Be Your Fool Once More)" in 1979. That same year, Downing produced "Midnight Lace," which reached the 50s on the charts, and "I Ain't No Fool," which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the "Story Behind The Story" reached the Top 40 and "Bring It On Home" reached the Top 20.

Two years passed before Downing created another hit, this time with the Team label. In 1982, "I'll Be Loving You" reached the Top 50, followed by "Darlene," which reached the lower 60s. The next year, "It Takes Love" reached the Top 40, followed by "Let's Sing About Love," which peaked in the mid-60s. In 1984, "The Best Of Families" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, "There’ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong".

===Vine Street years===
In 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the "Oh How Beautiful You Are" (To Me) and "Just One Night Won't Do," both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, "I Guess By Now."

The popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: "Mary, Oh Mary" and "Heartbreak Hill". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby "Blue" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.

===Later career===
Downing built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including "Mr. Jones."

In July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.

In 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.

Downing continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at [[Ontario]]'s [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Roy Clark]]. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.

==Style==
Downing's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.

== Producer ==
In additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent. In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represented his last recording.

''[[Domestic Blues]]'', which was released in 1998, was produced by the "Twang Trust" of Earle and [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]],<ref name="allmusic Domestic Blues">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/domestic-blues-mw0000598926|publisher=AllMusic|title=Domestic Blues|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> and Earle played guitar and sang backing vocals on the record.<ref name="biography"/> The album also features [[slide guitar]] player [[Jerry Douglas]], guitarist [[Peter Rowan]] and singer [[Nanci Griffith]] amongst its session musicians.<ref name="Loose"/>

All the songs on ''Domestic Blues'' were written by Kennedy except ''Angel is the Devil'' which was written by Earle.<ref name="biography"/> Earle was later to describe Kennedy as "the best songwriter I ever saw".<ref name="biography"/> The album was released on Earle's record label [[E-Squared Records|E-Squared]] and received generally favorable reviews.<ref name="artistdirect"/><ref name="allmusic Domestic Blues"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bapkennedy.com/about-domestic-blues.html|publisher=bapkennedy.com|title=About Domestic Blues|accessdate=3 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120002203/http://www.bapkennedy.com/about-domestic-blues.html|archivedate=20 November 2013}}</ref> It was also a commercial success, charting at number eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="biography"/>

Several songs from the album were used for movie soundtracks, including ''Vampire'' appearing in the soundtrack for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominated<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203230/awards|publisher=IMDb|title=You Can Count on Me – Awards|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> film ''[[You Can Count on Me]]'',<ref name="artistdirect"/> which also won the Grand Jury Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name="IMDB"/> Three other songs from ''Domestic Blues'' were also used in the film ''[[Southie (film)|Southie]]''.<ref name="biography"/>

While he was in Nashville, Kennedy developed a keen interest in the music of [[Hank Williams]], whom Kennedy described as his "favourite song writer"<ref name="newsletter"/> and a major influence. After he had finished recording ''Domestic Blues'', Kennedy recorded an album of Hank Williams covers entitled ''Hillbilly Shakespeare'',<ref name="artistdirect"/> which featured [[pedal steel guitar]] playing from [[B.J.

===''Lonely Street'', ''Serendipity'' and ''Moonlight Kiss'' (2000–05)===
After returning to the UK, Kennedy briefly managed an [[Elvis impersonator]] named The King, and was the producer for The King's album ''Gravelands'' – a collection of songs by other deceased artists performed in the style of [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="cdbaby"/> The record became a firm favourite of [[John Peel]] and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].

The album, which was released in 2000 on Kennedy's Lonely Street Discs label,<ref name="cdbaby"/> features bass guitar playing by [[Herbie Flowers]],<ref name="biography"/> who is noted for playing the famous bass line on [[Lou Reed]]'s hit song [[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/bass/the-25-best-basslines-of-all-time-509265/10/1|work=MusicRadar|title=The 25 best basslines of all time (page 11 of 25)|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref> It received generally positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lonely-street-mw0000061425|publisher=AllMusic|title=Lonely Street – Bap Kennedy|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bapkennedy.com/about-lonely-street.html|publisher=bapkennedy.com|title=About Lonely Street|accessdate=3 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118195406/http://www.bapkennedy.com/about-lonely-street.html|archivedate=18 November 2013}}</ref> Kennedy's ballad "Moonlight Kiss" from the album was later used in the soundtrack for hit Hollywood movie [[Serendipity (movie)|Serendipity]] (starring [[John Cusack]] and [[Kate Beckinsale]]).<ref name="biography"/>

'''William Knight Kirchen''' (born June 29, 1948) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was a member of [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] from 1967 to the mid-1970s and later worked with [[Nick Lowe]]. ''Guitar Player'' magazine described Kirchen as "Titan of The [[Telecaster]]" for his prowess on the guitar.

==Early life==
Kirchen was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] but grew up in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]<ref name="New Haven"/> where he attended [[Pioneer High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Ann Arbor High School]] and learned to play the trombone.<ref name="AllMusic">Pendragon, Jana [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-kirchen-mn0000069922 Biography] AllMusic. Retrieved June 11, 2012</ref> He met a folksinger named David Siglin, long-time manager of local folk music venue [[The Ark (folk venue)|The Ark]], and joined the local folk scene. While learning to play banjo and guitar, his musical interest began to extend beyond folk music and included the blues and various string bands.<ref name="AllMusic"/> During his student days at [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], Kirchen started a "psycho folk-rock" band and later a country band that included [[George Frayne]] and [[John Tichy]] which formed the basis for the [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] band.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

==Career==
[[Image:BillKirchenAldenTheater.jpg|left|thumb|Onstage at the Alden Theater, McLean, Virginia (2004)]]
In 1969, Kirchen took Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen to California and they developed a reputation as musical "outlaws" that were praised by other outlaw musicians and bands like [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[The Grateful Dead]] and the [[Allman Brothers Band]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's band  "played a collection of rock 'n' roll, hard-core country, boogie and rockabilly sounds produced in a "high-octane mix" that made them a "happening" group in the San Francisco Bay area.<ref name="Crosstown">[http://64.33.96.73/CrosstownArts/client_music/kirchen/bkabout.htm Bill Kirchen and Too Much Fun] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424045324/http://64.33.96.73/CrosstownArts/client_music/kirchen/bkabout.htm |date=April 24, 2010 }} Crosstown Arts. Retrieved June 13, 2012</ref>

Kirchen began to develop as guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and performer. He became known for his vocal and guitar work on such songs as "Mama Hated Diesels",  "Down to Seeds and Stems Again Blues" from the band's albums, ''Hot Licks, Cold Steel & Truckers' Favorites'' and ''Lost in the Ozone''.<ref name="AllMusic"/> His live performance work was captured on the 1973 album ''Live From Deep in the Heart of Texas'', recorded at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in 1973.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's Commander Cody band broke apart in 1976 and he formed a "swing orchestra" called the Moonlighters and began a decades-long collaboration with British musician [[Nick Lowe]].  Lowe produced the Moonlighters' second album ''Rush Hour'', and Kirchen toured with Lowe and joined him in the studio from time to time. During this period Kirchen also worked on albums with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Gene Vincent]], and [[Link Wray]].<ref name="AllMusic"/>

[[Image:BillKirchenBehindHead.jpg|right|thumb|Onstage in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] (2005)]]
Around 1986, Kirchen moved to the Washington, D.C. area and formed the band Too Much Fun with Dave Elliot on drums and John Previti on bass.  In 1996, the band won ten Washington Area Music Awards including Musician and Songwriter of the Year.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Crosstown"/> Kirchen became a contemporary and associate of many D.C. guitarists such as the late [[Danny Gatton]] and [[Roy Buchanan]], Link Wray, [[Tom Principato]], [[Evan Johns]], [[Billy Hancock]], Linwood Taylor, Dave Chappell, [[Jimmy Thackery]], the Nighthawks and others who, during this time, forged an elite fraternity of Washington D.C. area roots rock performers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Kirchen recorded the album ''Tombstone Every Mile'' on Demon Records, while in England and then released the recording in the USA after he signed with Black Top Records in 1994.<ref name="AllMusic"/> He released the critically acclaimed and musically eclectic album, ''Have Love, Will Travel'' in 1996 and ''Raise a Ruckus'' on [[Hightone Records]] in 1999.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen followed up with more album releases on Hightone Records including ''Tied to the Wheel'' in 2001, ''Dieselbilly Road Trip'' in 2003, and ''King of Dieselbilly'' (2005).

In 2006, Bill kicked off his new deal with [[Proper Records]] by recording "Hammer of the Honky-Tonk Gods" at their London studio. The band on the album was Nick Lowe, [[Geraint Watkins]] and [[Robert Trehern]] and it was engineered by [[Paul Riley (musician)|Paul Riley]].

This was followed in 2010 by another album – "Word to the Wise", once again recorded at Proper's studio in London by Paul Riley, with a band comprising [[Austin de Lone]], [[Jonny Castle]] and [[Jack O'Dell (musician)|Jack O'Dell]]. The record featured many guests including: [[Paul Carrack]], Elvis Costello, [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[Blackie Farrell]], [[Dan Hicks (singer)|Dan Hicks]], Nick Lowe, [[Maria Muldaur]] and more.

In November 2012, Kirchen was a guest performer on [[Larry Monroe (radio personality)|Larry Monroe]]'s Texas Radio Live show on [[KDRP-LP|KDRP]].

2013 saw the third Proper Records album released – also recorded in London by Paul Riley.  The band on "Seeds And Stems" was Jack O'Dell and Maurice Cridlin with guest appearances from Austin de Lone and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] among others.

===Legacy===
Allmusic's Jana Pendragon credits Kirchen with being one of the musicians that pioneered the [[Americana music|Americana]] movement in the 1980s, and also with being a founding father of "twangcore," along with [[Dave Alvin]], [[Wilco]] and [[Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's signature sound has been dubbed "dieselbilly" and incorporates elements of [[country music|country]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[Western swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]], laced with themes of American truck driving music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Kirchen's work in the early 1970s with Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen helped set the stage for the singers like [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] and other [[outlaw country]] bands with his recordings of songs like "Seeds And Stems."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanamusicshow.com/episode159 |title=Bill Kirchen – Interview and Music |publisher=Americana Music Show |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2014}}</ref> Kirchen is said to have "one of the most distinctive, pure-Fender Telecaster tone guitar sounds in modern music".<ref name="New Haven"/>

Kirchen was named "The Titan of The Telecaster"  by ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine<ref name="New Haven"/> for his musical prowess on the [[Fender Telecaster]] guitar. He played a 1959 model with a maple fretboard and sunburst finish that he calls the "coal burner", acquired in 1967 when he exchanged his [[Gibson SG]] with a stranger on a bus.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Vintage Guitar Magazine|title=Bill Kirchen|date=November 2001|author=Ward Meeker}}</ref> He eventually retired that guitar.

==Personal life==
Kirchen is a father and has been married for more than 25 years.<ref name="AllMusic"/> In 2005 he moved to the West Coast and then to [[Manchaca, Texas]]. In early 2007, he returned to Maryland,{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} then subsequently moved to Austin, Texas in 2011.

'''William Smith Monroe''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|n|ˈ|r|oʊ}} {{respell|mən|ROH}}; September 13, 1911<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1992 |publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]] |isbn=0-85112-939-0 |editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] |edition=1st |pages=1729–1730}}</ref> – September 9, 1996)<ref name="Flippo"/> was an American [[mandolin]]ist, singer, and songwriter, and created the [[bluegrass music]] genre. Because of this, he is often called the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#M|Father of Bluegrass]]".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Klein|first=Bradley|title=Bill Monroe: Celebrating The Father Of Bluegrass At 100|website=NPR.org |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/12/140366232/bill-monroe-celebrating-the-father-of-bluegrass-at-100|publisher=NPR|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

The genre takes its name from his band, the '''Blue Grass Boys''', who named their group for the [[Poa pratensis|bluegrass]] of Monroe's home state of [[Kentucky]]. He described the genre as "Scottish [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bill Monroe |website=2022 Monroe Mandolin Camp |url=https://monroemandolincamp.com/bill-monroe/ |access-date=2022-11-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Monroe was born on [[Bill Monroe Farm|his family's farm]] near [[Rosine, Kentucky]], the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan "Buck" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother, [[Pendleton Vandiver|James Pendleton "Pen" Vandiver]], were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Bill was of [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]] and [[English Americans|English]] heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and [[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]] already played the [[fiddle]] and [[guitar]], Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable [[mandolin]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolin's eight strings so he would not play too loudly.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Monroe's mother died when he was ten, and his father died six years later.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Eventually, his brothers and sisters moved away, leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver, whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances. This experience inspired one of Monroe's most famous compositions, "Uncle Pen", recorded in 1950,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and the 1972 album ''Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen.'' On that album, Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver. Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe "a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bill's aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bones."<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith |first=Richard D. |url=https://archive.org/details/cantyouhearmecal00smit/ |title=Can't You Hear Me Callin': the Life of Bill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass |date= |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-316-80381-6 |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |page=27 |language=en |oclc=42690222 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Also significant in Monroe's musical life was [[Arnold Shultz]], an influential [[fiddle]]r and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the [[blues]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Bluegrass Breakdown: The Making of the Old Southern Sound|author=Robert Cantwell|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|date=2003|isbn=9780252071171|pages=30–32}}</ref><ref>''The Father of Bluegrass Music'', DVD Documentary (1993)</ref>

==Professional career==
In 1929, Monroe moved to [[Indiana]] to work at an oil refinery with his brothers [[Birch Monroe|Birch]] and Charlie.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Together with a friend, Larry Moore, they formed the "Monroe Brothers", to play at local dances and house parties.

Birch and Moore soon left the group, and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo, eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations, first in Indiana and then, sponsored by Texas Crystals, on several radio broadcasts in [[Shenandoah, Iowa]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] from 1934 to 1936.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> [[RCA Records#Previous labels|RCA Victor]] signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song "What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul?" and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victor's [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label between 1936 and 1938.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Monroe: American Musician|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Monroe|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>

After the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938, Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but the group only lasted for three months.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Monroe then left Little Rock for [[Atlanta, Georgia]], to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boys,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> with singer/guitarist [[Cleo Davis]], fiddler Art Wooten, and bassist [[Amos Garren]].

In October 1939, Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], impressing Opry founder [[George D. Hay]] with his energetic performance of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]'s "[[Mule Skinner Blues]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Monroe recorded that song, along with seven others, at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940; by this time, the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singer/guitarist [[Clyde Moody]], fiddler Tommy Magness, and bassist Bill Wesbrooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doodah.net/bgb/|title=Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys|website=Doodah.net|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>

While the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks, Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group. He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings, often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers. A 1945 session for [[Columbia Records]] featured an [[accordion]], soon dropped from the band. Most importantly, Monroe added [[banjo]] player [[David "Stringbean" Akeman]] to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos. Monroe's pre-1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the [[string band|string-band tradition]] from which he came and the musical innovation to follow.

{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2022}}
Key developments occurred in Monroe's music with the addition of [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing. Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive three-finger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences. Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler [[Chubby Wise]] and bassist [[Howard Watts]], who often performed under the name "Cedric Rainwater".

In retrospect, this line-up of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the "Original Bluegrass Band", as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music, including breakneck tempos, sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements, and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or "breaks" on the mandolin, banjo, and fiddle. By this time, Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model "Lloyd Loar" mandolin, which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his career.<ref>Rosenberg, Neil V. (2005). ''BLUEGRASS: A History''. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press; {{ISBN|0-252-07245-6}}</ref>

The 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre, including "Toy Heart", "Blue Grass Breakdown", "[[Molly and Tenbrooks]]", "Wicked Path of Sin", "My Rose of Old Kentucky", "Little Cabin Home on the Hill", and Monroe's most famous song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954, appearing as the B-side of his first single for [[Sun Records]]. Monroe gave his blessing to Presley's [[rock and roll]] cover of the song, originally a slow [[ballad]] in [[waltz]] time, and re-recorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presley's version became a hit.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Several gospel-themed numbers are credited to the "Blue Grass Quartet", which featured four-part vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar – Monroe's usual practice when performing "sacred" songs.

Both Flatt and Scruggs left Monroe's band in early 1948, soon forming their own group, the [[Foggy Mountain Boys]]. In 1949, after signing with Decca Records, Monroe entered what has been called the "golden age" of his career<ref>''Bill Monroe and Bluegrass'' by Roughstock staff, January 27, 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |title=Roughstock's History of Country Music - Bill Monroe and Bluegrass |access-date=June 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620032558/http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |archive-date=June 20, 2009  }}</ref> with what many consider the classic "high lonesome" version of the Blue Grass Boys, featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of [[Jimmy Martin]], the banjo of [[Rudy Lyle]] (replacing [[Don Reno]]), and fiddlers such as Merle "Red" Taylor, [[Charlie Cline]], [[Bobby Hicks]], and [[Vassar Clements]].

This band recorded a number of bluegrass classics, including "My Little Georgia Rose", "On and On", "Memories of Mother and Dad", and "Uncle Pen", as well as instrumentals such as "Roanoke", "Big Mon", "Stoney Lonesome", "Get Up John", and the mandolin feature "Raw Hide". [[Carter Stanley]] joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when [[The Stanley Brothers]] had temporarily disbanded.

On January 16, 1953, Monroe was critically injured in a two-car wreck.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He and "Bluegrass Boys" bass player, [[Bessie Lee Mauldin]], were returning home from a fox hunt north of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. On highway 31-W, near White House, their car was struck by a drunken driver. Monroe, who had suffered injuries to his back, left arm and nose, was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville. It took him almost four months to recover and resume touring.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In the meantime [[Charlie Cline]] and [[Jimmy Martin]] kept the band together.<ref name="Rosenberg"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2024}}

By the late 1950s, however, Monroe's commercial fortunes had begun to slip.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The rise of rock-and-roll and the development of the "[[Nashville sound]]" in mainstream [[country music]] both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass. While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry, Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts, and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances.

==Folk revival==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}
Monroe's fortunes began to improve during the [[American folk music revival]] of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified.

The word "bluegrass" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, [[Reno and Smiley]], [[Jim & Jesse|Jim and Jesse]], and the [[Osborne Brothers]]. While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of [[Ralph Rinzler]], a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine ''[[Sing Out!]]'' that first publicly referred to Monroe as the "father" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at [[Roanoke, Virginia]] in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In 1964, before the [[Grateful Dead]] got together, [[Jerry Garcia]] caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gardenandgun.com/articles/jerry-garcias-bluegrass-roots/|title=Jerry Garcia's Bluegrass Roots|date=May 3, 2018|website=Gardenandgun.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

The growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] and singer/guitarist [[Peter Rowan]] from Massachusetts,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist [[Roland White]] and fiddler [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]] from California.

==Later years==

Even after the folk revival faded in the mid-1960s, it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music. Bluegrass festivals became common, with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances.

In 1967, Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at [[Beanblossom, Indiana|Bean Blossom]] in southern Indiana, a park he had purchased in 1951,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands; a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt, and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973. The annual ''Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival'' is now the world's oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/loc.afc.afc-legacies.200002995/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905004417/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/IN/200002995.html|url-status=dead|title=Bill Monroe Bluegrass Festival in Brown County|first=Representative (9th District) Baron P.

Monroe's compositions during his later period were largely instrumentals, including "Jerusalem Ridge", "Old Dangerfield" (originally spelled Daingerfield after [[Daingerfield, Texas|the town in East Texas]]),<ref>"Stoney Lonesome Fiddle Book", by Stacy Phillips</ref> and "My Last Days on Earth"; he settled into a new role as a musical patriarch who continued to influence younger generations of musicians. Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s; the first featured collaborations with country stars such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musicians.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Monroe also kept a hectic touring schedule.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> On April 7, 1990, Monroe performed for [[Farm Aid|Farm Aid IV]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana along with [[Willie Nelson]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Neil Young]] and with many other artists.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Dawn |date=18 June 2007 |title=RetroIndy: Farm Aid IV raised a bumper crop of cash |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2017/06/18/farm-aid-iv-raised-bumper-crop-cash/395865001/ |access-date=2024-05-08 |website=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Death ===
Monroe's last performance occurred on March 15, 1996. He ended his touring and playing career in April, following a stroke. Monroe died on September 9, 1996, in [[Springfield, Tennessee]], four days before his 85th birthday.<ref name="Flippo">{{cite magazine|last1=Flippo|first1=Chet|title=Industry Mourns Father of Bluegrass|magazine=Billboard|date=September 21, 1996|pages=6, 79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9|access-date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Jon Pareles |author-link1=Jon Pareles |title=Bill Monroe Dies at 84; Fused Musical Roots Into Bluegrass |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/10/arts/bill-monroe-dies-at-84-fused-musical-roots-into-bluegrass.html |url-access=subscription |access-date=31 October 2021 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 September 1996 |page=D 22}}</ref>

== Legacy and influence ==

According to [[Ralph Rinzler]], Bill Monroe impacted music in the following five ways:<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Live Recordings 1963-1980: Off the Record Volume 2 |title-link= |last=Rinzler |first=Ralph |author-link=Ralph Rinzler |first2= |last2= |author-link2= |others= |url=https://folkways-media.si.edu/docs/folkways/artwork/SFW40064.pdf#page=6 |date=1993 |access-date= |chapter= |page=7 |pages= |at= |type= |publisher=[[Smithsonian Folkways]] |id= |location= }}</ref>

# When others were going electric, Bill created a space for an acoustic string band tradition to continue to grow and develop within country music.
# He developed a distinct vocal tradition - the "high lonesome" sound.
# He established the mandolin as a virtuoso string band instrument
# He composed a diverse repertoire of songs and instrumental tunes which have become standard fare among bluegrass, country, and some pop musicians.
# More than any other musician of his time, he skillfully infused country music with archaic tonal subtlety, including Anglo-Scots-Irish and Blues influences.

Bill Monroe was made an honorary [[Kentucky Colonel]] in 1966.<ref name="Rosenberg">{{Cite book |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Neil V. |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/jj.13944080 |title=The music of Bill Monroe |last2=Wolfe |first2=Charles K. |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-252-05623-9 |series=Music in American life |location=Urbana, IL |publication-date=2007 |jstor=10.5406/jj.13944080 |oclc=1431193963 |access-date=}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2024}} He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1970,<ref name="LarkinGE" /> the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1971,<ref name="LarkinGE" /> and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (as an "early influence") in 1997. [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams Sr.]], and [[Johnny Cash]] are the only other performers honored in all three. As the "father of bluegrass", he was also an inaugural inductee into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame|International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] in 1991. Monroe was a recipient of a 1982 [[National Heritage Fellowship]] awarded by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/1982|title=NEA National Heritage Fellowships 1982 |author=<!--Not stated-->  |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=November 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929133224/https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/1982 |archive-date=September 29, 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref> That year's fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA. In 1993, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], and he was awarded the [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]] in 1995. His well-known song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" has been covered not only by bluegrass but also rock and country artists, most notably Elvis Presley, [[Paul McCartney]], and [[Patsy Cline]]. In 2003, [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] had Bill Monroe ranked No.&nbsp;16 on ''CMT 40 Greatest Men of Country Music''.

Artists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe. He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass. He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards, "That ain't no part of nothin'." Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a "musical giant" and recognize that "there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroe."<ref>{{cite news|author=Teachout, Terry|title=Kentucky Troubadour: A biography of Bill Monroe and the bluegrass music he invented.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/09/17/reviews/000917.17teachot.html|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>

More than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroe's performing career. Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right. Some of Monroe's band members who went on to greater prominence include singer/guitarists [[Clyde Moody]], [[Lester Flatt]], Jack Cook, [[Mac Wiseman]], [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Carter Stanley]], [[Del McCoury]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Roland White]], Roland Dunn and [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Doug Green]]; banjo players [[Earl Scruggs]], Bob Black, [[Butch Robins]], [[Buck Trent]], [[Don Reno]], [[David "Stringbean" Akeman|Stringbean]], [[Osborne Brothers|Sonny Osborne]], and [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]]; and fiddlers Tommy Magness, [[Chubby Wise]], [[Vassar Clements]], [[Byron Berline]], [[Kenny Baker (fiddler)|Kenny Baker]], [[Bobby Hicks]], [[Gordon Terry]], [[Randall Franks]] and Glen Duncan. Monroe also regularly performed with flat-picking guitar virtuoso [[Doc Watson]].

Modern bluegrass singer and mandolin player [[Ricky Skaggs]] was influenced by Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha, Kentucky. He stated, "I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong. He was so influential: I think he's probably the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his band."<ref name="Music">{{cite book

He has made numerous recordings, primarily in the [[rockabilly]] genre but also has a large body of recorded work in [[rock 'n' roll]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[country music]]. He performed live primarily in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area, but also played regularly at European roots music festivals.

==Early life==
Hancock was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and raised in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], where he has lived most of his life.  He attended George Washington High School in Alexandria, graduating in 1964. He came from a musical family. His maternal grandmother Katie sang with Minstrel shows in black face accompanying herself on piano and harmonica. Two of his aunts Eileen and Anita were a singing duo in the 1940s who sang at two or three Washington DC radios stations on a regular basis. His paternal grandfather Mitchell (Mitch) Hancock played mandolin from about 1897 until 1902. He often played on River Boats in New Orleans and recorded for the Edison Label. Billy's father worked for the Southern Railway and his mother worked for Waxie Maxie's, a local record store chain, and other record stores. The records his mother brought home from work, primarily rhythm and blues from the late 1940s, played a large and influential role in his musical development.

==Career==
Hancock began his career playing in bands around Washington, D.C., while still a teenager. After graduating from high school, he played with bands in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] before returning to the Washington area. In 1968, he moved to [[Baltimore]] to attend the [[Peabody Conservatory]], and continued to play in bands in the Baltimore area.

In the early 1970s, Hancock began a collaboration with [[Danny Gatton]] and they formed Danny and the Fat Boys with Hancock (bass, vocals), Gatton (guitars), and Dave Elliott (drums, vocals). In 1975, the group released ''American Music'' on a label owned by Hancock and his brother. The album's title was taken from a rhythm and blues song Hancock had written. It was later re-issued on CD.

In 1978, Hancock recorded four rockabilly songs under the name Billy Hancock and the Tennessee Rockets for [[Ripsaw Records]], a small independent label. He continued to record rockabilly for Ripsaw under that name for two years. Ripsaw released four singles during that time and licensed those and other titles to larger labels both in the U.S. and France. It is these rockabilly recordings for which Hancock is known internationally.

In 1983, Hancock recorded another rockabilly record, "Hey! Little Rock And Roller", that was released in France on the Big Beat Label. Later that year, he returned to Ripsaw to record various rock and roll songs, six of which Ripsaw released in 1985. All of the Ripsaw material was later released on CDs by Finnish Bluelight Records.

Throughout his career, Hancock played in backing bands for prominent musicians, including [[Fats Domino]], [[Gene Vincent]], blues guitarist [[Roy Buchanan]], rockabilly [[Charlie Feathers]], [[the Clovers]], [[Amos Milburn]], and country musicians [[Dottie West]] and [[Jean Shepard]]. He co-produced and played guitar on [[Tex Rubinowitz]]'s rockabilly song "Hot Rod Man."

In 2002, Hancock and his brother the television director, Dale Hancock founded Turkey Mountain Records, an independent record label. The label was formed to find and promote talented artists of all genres who, for whatever reasons, have been ignored by other record labels. Their Archival Series re-released material on artists of the past whose works have been unavailable until now. Turkey Mountain Records' roster of artists included: Danny Gatton, The British Walkers (featuring Roy Buchanan), Bobbie (The Kid) Howard with Link Wray and The Ray Men, Charlie Feathers, The Fallen Angels, and Billy Hancock himself.

In 2005, the [[Washington Area Music Association]] WAMA awarded Hancock a Special Recognition Award for his 40-plus years as a vocalist, musician, songwriter, producer, promoter, and label owner. In 2006, WAMA presented him with two "Wammie" awards for 2005 Roots Rock Vocalist and Roots Rock Recording.  In 2012, WAMA presented Hancock as one of "The Fallen Angels" a special recognition award.

In 2010, Hancock was inducted into the Southern Legends Hall of Fame. He is already a member of three other International Halls of Fame.

Hancock was also the television host for ''American Music'' in Arlington, Virginia, where he interviewed and showcased songwriters and a music historian.

He was also a member of the resurrected art rock group from the sixties, The Fallen Angels.

On 4 November 2012 Hancock was inducted into The Northern Virginia Blues Society, Blues Hall of Fame in Manassas, Va.

Kramer in Latham, Sean (ed.), 2021, ''The World of Bob Dylan'', pp. 251–263.</ref>

Dylan was born and raised in [[St. Louis County, Minnesota]]. Following [[Bob Dylan (album)|his self-titled debut album]] of traditional [[Folk-songs|folk songs]] in 1962, he made his breakthrough with ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963). The album featured "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]", which adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He released the politically charged ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [[Electric Dylan controversy|drew controversy]] among folk purists when he adopted [[Amplifier|electrically amplified]] rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most influential rock albums of the 1960s: ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]''. When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to rock, the mix became more complex. His six-minute single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.<ref name=LARS>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-20110516| title=500 Greatest Songs Of All Time| date=April 7, 2011| access-date=January 6, 2020|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| archive-date=October 31, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031103816/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-2-54028/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Rogovoy|first=Seth| title=How Bob Dylan's greatest song changed music history — a deep-dive into an accidental masterpiece| url=https://forward.com/culture/475865/how-bob-dylans-greatest-song-changed-music-history-a-deep-dive-into-an/| date=September 27, 2021| access-date=September 30, 2021| url-status=live| archive-date=September 28, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928170718/https://forward.com/culture/475865/how-bob-dylans-greatest-song-changed-music-history-a-deep-dive-into-an/| quote=Bruce Springsteen, who was originally touted as a 'new Dylan' when he was signed to Columbia Records, Dylan's label, by the same label honcho, John Hammond, who signed Dylan, said this about 'Like a Rolling Stone':<br />'Dylan freed your mind and showed us that because the music was physical did not mean it was anti-intellect. He had the vision and talent to make a pop song so that it contained the whole world. He invented a new way a pop singer could sound, broke through the limitations of what a recording could achieve, and he changed the face of rock 'n' roll for ever and ever.'| publisher=[[The Forward]]}}</ref>

In July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|a large body of songs]] with members of [[the Band]], who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were later released as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored [[country music]] and rural themes on ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967), ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969) and ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970). In 1975, he released ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and released three albums of contemporary [[gospel music]] before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's [[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|''Time Out of Mind'']] (1997) marked the beginning of a career renaissance. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since, most recently ''[[Rough and Rowdy Ways]]'' (2020). He also recorded a trilogy of albums covering the [[Great American Songbook]], especially songs sung by [[Frank Sinatra]], and an album smoothing his early rock material into a mellower [[Americana (music)|Americana]] sensibility, ''[[Shadow Kingdom]]'' (2023). Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the [[Never Ending Tour]].<ref>Heylin, Clinton, 2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind The Shades, The 20th Anniversary Edition'', pp. 646–652.</ref>

Since 1994, Dylan has published [[Bob Dylan bibliography#Art books by Bob Dylan|nine books of paintings and drawings]], and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 125 million records,<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bob-dylan-sells-entire-catalog-recorded-music-sony-music-rcna13434| title = Bob Dylan sells his entire catalog of recorded music to Sony| author = Lenthang, Marlene| date = January 25, 2022| access-date = June 11, 2024| website = NBC News}}</ref> making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling musicians ever]].

In the  early 1950s Dylan listened to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] radio show and heard the songs of [[Hank Williams]]. He later wrote: “The sound of his voice went through me like an electric rod.”<ref name="chronicles95"/> Dylan was also impressed by the delivery of [[Johnnie Ray]]: “He was the first singer whose voice and style, I guess, I totally fell in love with…  I loved his style, wanted to dress like him too.” <ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Christian|title=Bob Dylan In His Own Words|location=New York|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=1993|page=7|isbn= 0711932190}}</ref> As a teenager, Dylan heard [[rock and roll]] on radio stations broadcasting from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]].<ref name="Shelton-38">Shelton, pp. 38–39.</ref>

{{blockquote|The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough ... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.<ref name="Crowe-1985"/>}}

During this period, he began to introduce himself as "Bob Dylan".<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 7.</ref> In his memoir, he wrote that he considered adopting the surname ''Dillon'' before unexpectedly seeing poems by [[Dylan Thomas]], and deciding upon the given name spelling.<ref>Dylan, pp. 78–79.</ref><ref group="a">According to Dylan biographer [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], Dylan first confided his change of name to his high school girlfriend, Echo Helstrom, in 1958, telling her that he had found a "great name, Bob Dillon". Shelton surmises that Dillon had two sources: [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the TV western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing's principal families. While Shelton was writing Dylan's biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him, "Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance." At the University of Minnesota, Dylan told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. He later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton added that only when he reached New York in 1961 did he begin to spell his name "Dylan", by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44–45.</ref> In a 2004 interview, he said, "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."<ref name="60minutes2005" />

===1960s===
====Relocation to New York and record deal====
In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]]<ref>Sounes, p. 72</ref> at [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].<ref>Dylan, p. 98.</ref> Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances.

By the release of Dylan's second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer-songwriter. Many songs on the album were labeled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]'s topical songs.<ref>Shelton, pp. 138–142.</ref> "[[Oxford Town]]" was an account of [[James Meredith]]'s ordeal as the first Black student to enroll at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>Shelton, p. 156.</ref> The first song on the album, "Blowin' in the Wind", partly derived its melody from the traditional [[Slave Songs of the United States|slave song]] "No More Auction Block",<ref>The booklet by [[John Bauldie]] accompanying Dylan's ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991]]'' (1991) says: "Dylan acknowledged the debt in 1978 to journalist Marc Rowland: ''Blowin' In The Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'—that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' In The Wind follows the same feeling.{{' "}} pp. 6–8.''</ref> while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].<ref name="PPM">{{cite magazine|author=Eder, Bruce|title=Peter, Paul and Mary biography|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/331058/peter-paul-and-mary/biography|access-date=June 5, 2015|magazine=Billboard|archive-date=November 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101000237/http://www.billboard.com/artist/331058/peter-paul-and-mary/biography|url-status=dead}}</ref> "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]" was based on the folk ballad "[[Lord Randall]]". With its apocalyptic premonitions, the song gained resonance when the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 101–103.</ref><ref group="a">In a May 1963 interview with [[Studs Terkel]], Dylan broadened the meaning of the song, saying "the pellets of poison flooding the waters" refers to "the lies people are told on their radios and in their newspapers." Cott (2006), p. 8.</ref> Both songs marked a new direction in songwriting, blending a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]], [[imagism|imagist]] lyrical attack with traditional folk form.<ref>Ricks, pp. 329–344.</ref>

Dylan's topical songs led to his being viewed as more than just a songwriter. [[Janet Maslin]] wrote of ''Freewheelin{{'}}'': <blockquote>These were the songs that established [Dylan] as the voice of his generation—someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about [[nuclear disarmament]] and the growing [[Civil Rights Movement]]: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.<ref>Maslin, Janet in Miller, Jim (ed.) (1981), ''The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll'', 1981, p. 220</ref><ref group="a">The title "Spokesman of a Generation" was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came to feel it was a label the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Volume One|Chronicles]]'', Dylan wrote: "The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline 'Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman.' I felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs." Dylan (2004), p.119</ref></blockquote> ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' also included love songs and surreal [[talking blues]]. Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona,<ref>Scaduto, p. 35.</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including [[the Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said of the album: "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude—it was incredibly original and wonderful".<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993. p. 97</ref>

The rough edge of Dylan's singing unsettled some but attracted others. Author [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying".<ref>Hedin, p. 259.</ref> Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as [[Joan Baez]], who became Dylan's advocate and lover.<ref>Sounes, pp. 136–138.</ref> Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.<ref>Joan Baez entry, Gray (2006), pp. 28–31.</ref> Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included [[the Byrds]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[the Hollies]], [[the Association]], [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Turtles]].

"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]", recorded during the ''Freewheelin''' sessions with a backing band, was released as Dylan's first single in December 1962, but then swiftly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and [[Sun Records]]".<ref>[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]]. Musicians on "Mixed Up Confusion": George Barnes & [[Bruce Langhorne]] (guitars); [[Dick Wellstood]] (piano); [[Gene Ramey]] (bass); [[Herb Lovelle]] (drums)</ref>

====Protest and ''Another Side''====
{{Listen|type=music
 |filename=Bob Dylan - The Times They Are a-Changin'.ogg
 |title = "The Times They Are a-Changin{{'"}}
 |description= Dylan said of "The Times They Are a-Changin{{'"}}: "This was definitely a song with a purpose. I wanted to write a big song, some kind of theme song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close and allied together at that time."<ref name="Crowe-1985"/>}}
In May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that "[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]" was potentially [[libelous]] to the [[John Birch Society]]. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.<ref>Dylan had recorded "Talkin' John Birch Society Blues" for his [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|''Freewheelin'']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including "[[Masters of War]]". See Heylin (2000), pp. 114–115.</ref>

Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963. Dylan performed "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" and "[[When the Ship Comes In]]".<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 49.</ref>

Dylan's third album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin'<nowiki/>]]'', reflected a more politicized Dylan.<ref>Gill, pp. 37–41.</ref> The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" addressing the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]], and the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" the death of Black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll at the hands of young White socialite William Zantzinger.<ref>Ricks, pp. 221–233.</ref> "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]" and "[[North Country Blues]]" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "[[Boots of Spanish Leather]]" and "[[One Too Many Mornings]]".<ref>Williams, p. 56.</ref>

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.<ref>Shelton, pp. 200–205.</ref> Accepting the "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award" from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee|Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] shortly after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].<ref>Part of Dylan's speech went: "There's no black and white, left and right to me any more; there's only up and down and down is very close to the ground. And I'm trying to go up without thinking of anything trivial such as politics...I got to admit that the man who shot President Kennedy, Lee Oswald, I don't know exactly where --what he thought he was doing, but I got to admit honestly that I too – I saw some of myself in him. I don't think it would have gone – I don't think it could go that far. But I got to stand up and say I saw things that he felt, in me – not to go that far and shoot. (Boos and hisses) You can boo..."; see, Shelton, pp. 200–205.</ref>
[[File:Bob Dylan in November 1963.jpg|alt=A spotlight shines on Dylan as he performs onstage.|left|thumb|''Bobby'' Dylan, as the college yearbook lists him: [[St. Lawrence University]], upstate New York, November 1963]]
''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'', recorded in a single evening on June 9, 1964,<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 60.</ref> had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on "[[I Shall Be Free No. 10]]" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare". "[[Spanish Harlem Incident]]" and "[[To Ramona]]" are passionate love songs, while "[[Black Crow Blues]]" and "[[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]]" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. "[[It Ain't Me Babe]]", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him.<ref>Shelton, p. 222.</ref> His new direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] "[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]", which sets [[social commentary]] against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as "chains of flashing images,"<ref group="a">In an interview with Seth Goddard for ''Life'' (July 5, 2001) Ginsberg said Dylan's technique had been inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]: "(Dylan) pulled ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' from my hand and started reading it and I said, 'What do you know about that?' He said, 'Somebody handed it to me in '59 in St. Paul and it blew my mind.' So I said 'Why?' He said, 'It was the first poetry that spoke to me in my own language.' So those chains of flashing images you get in Dylan, like 'the motorcycle black Madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom lover,' they're influenced by Kerouac's chains of flashing images and spontaneous writing, and that spreads out into the people". {{cite book|editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Schumacher|title=First Thought: Conversations with Allen Ginsberg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ch0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT322|date=2017|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-1-4529-4995-6|pages=322–}}</ref> and "[[My Back Pages]]", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions.<ref>Shelton, pp. 219–222.</ref>

In the latter half of 1964 and into 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to [[folk-rock]] pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [[Carnaby Street]] wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed "[[Beatle boot]]s". A London reporter noted "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of [[Leicester Square]]. He looks like an undernourished [[cockatoo]]."<ref>Shelton, pp. 267–271, 288–291.</ref> Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Asked about a movie he planned while on [[Les Crane]]'s television show, he told Crane it would be a "cowboy horror movie." Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, "No, I play my mother."<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 178–181.</ref>

Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements.<ref>Lee, p. 18.</ref>

In 1965, headlining the [[Newport Folk Festival]], Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a [[pickup group]] featuring [[Mike Bloomfield]] on guitar and [[Al Kooper]] on organ.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 208–216.</ref> Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 was met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs.

Dylan's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.<ref>Shelton, pp. 305–314.</ref><ref>A year earlier, [[Irwin Silber]], editor of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', had published an "Open Letter to Bob Dylan", criticizing Dylan's stepping away from political songwriting: "I saw at Newport how you had somehow lost contact with people. Some of the paraphernalia of fame were getting in your way." ''Sing Out!'', November 1964, quoted in Shelton, p. 313. This letter has been mistakenly described as a response to Dylan's 1965 Newport appearance.</ref> In the September issue of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time&nbsp;...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers&nbsp;... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel".<ref>''Sing Out!'', September 1965, quoted in Shelton, p. 313.</ref> On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording "[[Positively 4th Street]]".

At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 238–243.</ref> The Nashville sessions produced the double album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966), featuring what Dylan called "that thin wild mercury sound".<ref>"The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the ''Blonde on Blonde'' album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." Dylan Interview, ''Playboy'', March 1978; reprinted in Cott, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 204.</ref> Kooper described it as "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical worlds of Nashville and of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.<ref>Gill, p. 95.</ref>

On November 22, 1965, Dylan quietly married 25-year-old former model [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]].<ref name="Sounes-p193">Sounes, p. 193.</ref> Some of Dylan's friends, including Ramblin' Jack Elliott, say that, immediately after the event, Dylan denied he was married.<ref name="Sounes-p193"/> Writer [[Nora Ephron]] made the news public in the ''[[New York Post]]'' in February 1966 with the headline "Hush! Bob Dylan is wed".<ref>Shelton, p. 325.</ref>

Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and harmonica. In the second, backed by the Hawks, he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and [[Slow clap|slow clapped]].<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 244–261.</ref> The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [[Free Trade Hall]] in England on May 17, 1966.<ref>{{cite magazine| url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-bootleg-series-vol-4-the-royal-albert-hall-concert-193009/ | title = The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4: The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert| date = October 6, 1998| access-date= January 25, 2020|magazine= Rolling Stone}}</ref> A recording of this concert was released in 1998: ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]''. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" to which Dylan responded, "I don't believe you&nbsp;... You're a liar!" Dylan turned to his band and said, "Play it fucking loud!"<ref>Dylan's dialogue with the Manchester audience is recorded (with subtitles) in Martin Scorsese's documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]''</ref>

During his 1966 tour, Dylan was described as exhausted and acting "as if on a death trip".<ref>Heylin (2011), p. 251.</ref> D. A. Pennebaker, the filmmaker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else".<ref>Heylin (2011), p. 250.</ref> In a 1969 interview with [[Jann Wenner]], Dylan said, "I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things&nbsp;... just to keep going, you know?"<ref>''Rolling Stone'', November 29, 1969. Reprinted in Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 140.</ref>

====Motorcycle accident and reclusion====
On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his motorcycle, a [[Triumph Tiger 100]], near his home in [[Woodstock, New York]]. Dylan said he broke several [[vertebrae]] in his neck.<ref name="Sounes-217">Sounes, pp. 217–219.</ref> The circumstances of the accident are unclear since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.<ref name="Sounes-217" /><ref name="crash">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/email/articles/web/20060729-bob-dylan-motorcycle-woodstock-methamphetamine-robert-shelton-howard-sounes-ed-thaler.shtml |title=The Bob Dylan Motorcycle-Crash Mystery |author=Scherman, Tony |date=July 29, 2006 |access-date=June 18, 2014 |publisher=American Heritage |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106200746/http://www.americanheritage.com/email/articles/web/20060729-bob-dylan-motorcycle-woodstock-methamphetamine-robert-shelton-howard-sounes-ed-thaler.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2006 }}</ref> Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered him the chance to escape the pressures around him.<ref name="Sounes-217" /><ref name="shades268">Heylin (2000), p. 268.</ref> Dylan concurred: "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered.

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, but they rejected it as incomprehensible to mainstream audiences.<ref>Sounes, p. 216.</ref> The film, titled ''[[Eat the Document]]'' on [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies, has since been screened at a few film festivals.<ref>Lee, pp. 39–63.</ref> Secluded from public gaze, Dylan recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|over 100 songs]] during 1967 at his Woodstock home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, "[[Big Pink]]".<ref>Sounes, pp. 222–225.</ref> These songs were initially offered as demos for other artists to record and were hits for [[Julie Driscoll]], the Byrds, and Manfred Mann. The public heard these recordings when ''[[Great White Wonder]]'', the first "[[bootleg recording]]", appeared in West Coast shops in July 1969, containing Dylan material recorded in Minneapolis in 1961 and seven Basement Tapes songs. This record gave birth to a minor industry in the illicit release of recordings by Dylan and other major rock artists.<ref>Heylin, 2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', p. 280.</ref> Columbia released a Basement selection in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''.

In late 1967, Dylan returned to studio recording in Nashville,<ref name="BjornerJWH">{{cite web|title=Columbia Studio A, Nashville, Tennessee, John Wesley Harding sessions|url=http://www.bjorner.com/DSN01620%201967.htm#DSN01640|access-date=November 10, 2008|publisher=Bjorner's Still On the Road}}</ref> accompanied by [[Charlie McCoy]] on bass,<ref name="BjornerJWH" /> [[Kenny Buttrey]] on drums<ref name="BjornerJWH" /> and [[Pete Drake]] on steel guitar.<ref name="BjornerJWH" /> The result was ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'', a record of short songs thematically drawing on the [[American West]] and [[the Bible]]. The sparse structure and instrumentation, with lyrics that took the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition seriously, was a departure from Dylan's previous work.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 282–288.</ref> It included "[[All Along the Watchtower]]", famously covered by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name="Crowe-1985">[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]].</ref><ref group="a">Later recorded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], whose version Dylan acknowledged as definitive.</ref> [[Woody Guthrie]] died in October 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a memorial concert held at [[Carnegie Hall]] on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by the Band.<ref>Heylin (2011), p. 289.</ref>

In 1969, Dylan was asked to write songs for ''Scratch'', [[Archibald MacLeish]]'s musical adaptation of "[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]". MacLeish initially praised Dylan's contributions, writing to him "Those songs of yours have been haunting me—and exciting me," but creative differences led to Dylan leaving the project.

Dylan traveled to England to top the bill at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]] on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the [[Woodstock Festival]] closer to home.<ref>Sounes, pp. 248–253.</ref>

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable.

[[Olivia Newton-John]] covered "If Not For You" on her [[If Not for You (album)|debut album]] and "[[The Man in Me]]" was prominently featured in the film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998).

''[[Tarantula (poetry collection)|Tarantula]]'', a freeform book of prose-poetry, had been written by Dylan during a creative burst in 1964&ndash;65.<ref>Heylin,  2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', pp. 195–198.</ref> Dylan shelved his book for several years, apparently uncertain of its status,<ref>Heylin,  2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', pp. 264–6.</ref> until he suddenly informed [[Macmillan Inc.|Macmillan]] at the end of 1970 that the time had come to publish it.<ref>Heylin,  2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', p. 325.</ref> The book attracted negative reviews but later critics have suggested its affinities with ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' and ''[[A Season In Hell]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bobdylan.com/books/tarantula/| title = Tarantula| author =Spitzer, Mark| date = November 27, 2013| access-date = March 12, 2024| website =bobdylan.com}}</ref>

Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan recorded with [[Leon Russell]] at [[Blue Rock Studio|Blue Rock]], a small studio in Greenwich Village. These sessions resulted in "[[Watching the River Flow]]" and a new recording of "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]".<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 128.</ref> On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded "[[George Jackson (song)|George Jackson]]", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] in [[San Quentin State Prison]].<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 342–343.</ref> Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's [[Concert for Bangladesh]] on August 1, 1971, attracted media coverage as his live appearances had become rare.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 328–331.</ref>

In 1972, Dylan joined [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', providing [[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)|the soundtrack]] and playing "Alias", a member of Billy's gang.<ref>C. P. Lee wrote: "In Garrett's ghost-written memoir, ''[[The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid]]'', published within a year of Billy's death, he wrote that 'Billy's partner doubtless had a name which was his legal property, but he was so given to changing it that it is impossible to fix on the right one.

Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, [[David Geffen]]'s [[Asylum Records]], when his contract with Columbia Records expired.<ref>Heylin (2011), pp. 352–354</ref> His next album, ''[[Planet Waves]]'', was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour.<ref>Heylin (2011), pp. 354–360</ref> The album included two versions of [[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|"Forever Young"]], which became one of his most popular songs.<ref name="Sounes-p273">Sounes, pp. 273–274.</ref> As one critic described it, the song projected "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan",<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 354.</ref> and Dylan said "I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental".<ref name="Crowe-1985"/> Columbia Records simultaneously released ''[[Dylan (1973 album)|Dylan]]'', a collection of studio outtakes, widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 358.</ref>

In January 1974, Dylan, backed by the Band, embarked on a [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|North American tour]] of 40 concerts—his first tour for seven years. A live double album, ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before the Flood]]'', was released on Asylum Records. Soon, according to [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records sent word they "will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold".<ref name="Shelton-378">Shelton, p. 378.</ref> Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, unhappy that Geffen had sold only 600,000 copies of ''Planet Waves'' despite millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour;<ref>Heylin (2011), p. 358</ref> he returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.<ref>Shelton (1986), p. 436</ref>

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged.

In ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', journalist Bill Wyman wrote: <blockquote>''Blood on the Tracks'' is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.<ref>{{cite news| title=Bob Dylan | work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | date=May 5, 2001 | url=http://www.salon.com/2001/05/22/dylan_3/ | access-date=September 7, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

In the middle of 1975, Dylan championed boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]], imprisoned for triple murder, with his ballad "[[Hurricane (Bob Dylan song)|Hurricane]]" making the case for Carter's innocence.

The 1975 tour with the Revue provided the backdrop to Dylan's film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'', a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences.

''[[Slow Train Coming]]'' (1979) featured [[Dire Straits]] guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]] and was produced by veteran [[R&B]] producer [[Jerry Wexler]].

When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:

{{blockquote|Years ago they&nbsp;... said I was a prophet. I used to say, "No I'm not a prophet", they say "Yes you are, you're a prophet." I said, "No it's not me."

===1980s===
In late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. His second Christian album, ''[[Saved (Bob Dylan album)|Saved]]'' (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as "the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, ''Slow Train Coming II'' and inferior".<ref>Gray (2000), p. 11.</ref> His third Christian album was ''[[Shot of Love]]'' (1981).<ref name="Thompson2000">{{cite book|author=John Joseph Thompson|title=Raised by Wolves: The Story of Christian Rock & Roll|url=https://archive.org/details/raisedbywolvesst0000thom|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-421-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/raisedbywolvesst0000thom/page/n258 73]–}}</ref> The album featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs.

[[File:Bob Dylan in Toronto2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dylan, onstage and with eyes closed, plays a chord on an electric guitar.|Dylan in Toronto, April 18, 1980]]
Reception of Dylan's 1980s recordings varied. Gray criticized Dylan's 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.<ref>Gray (2000), pp. 11–14.</ref> ''[[Infidels (Bob Dylan album)|Infidels]]'' (1983) employed Knopfler again as lead guitarist and also as producer; the sessions resulted in several songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were "[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]", which was both a tribute to the [[Blind Willie McTell|eponymous blues musician]] and an evocation of [[African American history]],<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 56–59.</ref> "Foot of Pride" and "[[Lord Protect My Child]]". These three songs were later released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991]]''.<ref>Sounes, pp. 354–356.</ref>

Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded ''[[Empire Burlesque]]''.<ref name=Sounes362>Sounes, p. 362.</ref> [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and [[Cyndi Lauper]], was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound "a little bit more contemporary".<ref name=Sounes362/> In 1985 Dylan sang on [[USA for Africa]]'s famine relief single "[[We Are the World]]". He also joined [[Artists United Against Apartheid]], providing vocals for their single "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3023454/steven-van-zandt-tells-the-story-of-sun-city-and-fighting-apartheid-in-south-africa |title=Steven Van Zandt Tells The Story Of 'Sun City' And Fighting Apartheid In South Africa |work=Fast Company |date=December 13, 2013 |access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref> On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[JFK Stadium]], Philadelphia. Backed by [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]], he performed a ragged version of "Ballad of Hollis Brown", a tale of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience: "I hope that some of the money&nbsp;... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe&nbsp;... one or two million, maybe&nbsp;... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks".<ref>Sounes, p. 367.</ref> His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but inspired [[Willie Nelson]] to organize a concert, [[Farm Aid]], to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.<ref>Sounes, pp. 365–367.</ref> 

In October 1985, Dylan released [[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], a box set featuring 53 tracks, 18 of them previously unreleased. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote: “Historically, ''Biograph'' is significant not for what it did for Dylan's career, but for establishing the box set, complete with hits and rarities, as a viable part of rock history.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/biograph-mw0000189728#:~:text=AllMusic%20Review&text=But%20Biograph%20is%20really%20remarkable,the%20more%20impressive%20in%20retrospect.| title=Biograph Review| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| access-date=February 28, 2024| website=allmusic.com}}</ref> ''Biograph'' also contained liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] in which Dylan discussed the origins of some of his songs.<ref>Bell, 2013, ''Time Out of Mind: The Lives of Bob Dylan''. p. 31.</ref>

In April 1986, Dylan made a foray into [[rap]] when he added vocals to the opening verse of "Street Rock" on [[Kurtis Blow]]'s album ''[[Kingdom Blow]]''.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 63</ref> Dylan's next studio album, ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'' (1986), contained three covers (by [[Junior Parker]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and the gospel hymn "[[Precious Memories (hymn)|Precious Memories]]"), plus three collaborations (with [[Tom Petty]], Sam Shepard and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]), and two solo compositions by Dylan. A reviewer wrote that "the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating."<ref>{{cite web| url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6448|pure_url=yes}}| title=Knocked Out Loaded| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| access-date=May 2, 2010| website=AllMusic}}</ref> It was the first Dylan album since his 1962 debut to fail to make the Top 50.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 595.</ref> Some critics have called the song Dylan co-wrote with Shepard, "[[Brownsville Girl]]", a masterpiece.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 95–100.</ref>

In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the [[Grateful Dead]] in 1987, resulting in the live album ''[[Dylan & The Dead]]'', which received negative reviews; Erlewine said it was "quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead".<ref>{{cite web| url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r54428|pure_url=yes}}| title=Dylan & The Dead| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| date=July 27, 1989| access-date=September 10, 2009| website=AllMusic}}</ref> Dylan initiated what came to be called the [[Never Ending Tour]] on June 7, 1988, performing with a back-up band featuring guitarist [[G. E. Smith]]. Dylan would continue to tour with a small, changing band for the next 30 years.<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 297–299.</ref> In 1987, Dylan starred in [[Richard Marquand]]'s movie ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'', in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover ([[Fiona (singer)|Fiona]]) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation ([[Rupert Everett]]).<ref>Sounes, pp. 376–383.</ref> Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—"Night After Night", and "Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of [[John Hiatt]]'s "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 599–604.</ref>

[[File:Bob Dylan Barcelona.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Dylan plays his guitar and sings into a microphone onstage.|Dylan in Barcelona, Spain, 1984]]

Dylan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1988. Bruce Springsteen, in his introduction, declared, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual".<ref name=":Sprinsgteen"/> ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' (1988) sold even more poorly than ''Knocked Out Loaded''.<ref name="Sounes 385">Sounes, p. 385.</ref> Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13">Gray (2000), p. 13.</ref> The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] Dylan co-founded with George Harrison, [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Roy Orbison]] and Tom Petty. In late 1988, their ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' reached number three on the US albums chart,<ref name="Sounes 385"/> featuring songs described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 627–628.</ref> Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]''.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 638–640.</ref>

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with ''[[Oh Mercy]]'', produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. Gray praised the album as "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13"/> "[[Most of the Time]]", a lost-love composition, was prominently featured in the film [[High Fidelity (film)|''High Fidelity'']] (2000), while "[[What Was It You Wanted]]" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<ref>Ricks, pp. 413–420.</ref> The religious imagery of [[Ring Them Bells (song)|"Ring Them Bells"]] struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.<ref>Scott Marshall wrote: "When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods. For Dylan, the world will eventually know that there is only one God." Marshall, ''Restless Pilgrim'', p. 103.</ref>

===1990s===
Dylan's 1990s began with ''[[Under the Red Sky]]'' (1990), an about-face from the serious ''Oh Mercy''. It contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and [[Carolyn Dennis]], Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 174.</ref> Musicians on the album included George Harrison, [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Elton John]]. The record received negative reviews and sold poorly.<ref>Sounes, p. 391.</ref> In 1990 and 1991 Dylan was described by his biographers as drinking heavily, impairing his performances on stage.<ref>Heylin, 2000, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 661–665.</ref><ref>Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 396–398.</ref> In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Dylan dismissed allegations that drinking was interfering with his music: "That's completely inaccurate. I can drink or not drink. I don't know why people would associate drinking with ''anything'' I do, really".<ref>Cott (ed.), 2006, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 421.</ref>

Defilement and remorse were themes Dylan addressed when he received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] from [[Jack Nicholson]] in February 1991.<ref name =Lifetime>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/bob-dylan-before-the-nobel-12-times-he-accepted-an-honor-w451097/the-grammy-lifetime-achievement-award-1991-w451107| title=Bob Dylan Before the Nobel: 12 Times He Publicly Accepted an Honor| author=Greene, Andy| date=November 18, 2016| access-date=August 25, 2017| magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The event coincided with the start of the [[Gulf War]] and Dylan played "[[Masters of War]]"; ''Rolling Stone'' called his performance "almost unintelligible".<ref name=":R&REncylopedia"/> He made a short speech: "My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways{{'"}}.<ref name =Lifetime/><ref name="Heylin-664">Heylin (2000), pp. 664–665.</ref> This was a paraphrase of 19th-century Orthodox Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]'s commentary on Psalm 27.<ref>Bell, 2012, ''Once Upon a Time: The Lives of Bob Dylan.'', p. 101.</ref> On October 16, 1992, the thirtieth anniversary of Dylan's debut album was celebrated with a concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], christened "Bobfest" by Neil Young and featuring [[John Mellencamp]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Eddie Vedder]], Dylan and others. It was recorded as the live album ''[[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration]]''.<ref name=":R&REncylopedia"/> 

Over the next few years Dylan returned to his roots with two albums covering traditional folk and blues songs: ''[[Good as I Been to You]]'' (1992) and ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'' (1993), backed solely by his acoustic guitar.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/world-gone-wrong-mw0000103945| title=World Gone Wrong| author=Erlewine, Thomas| date=April 10, 2004| access-date=February 1, 2020| publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref> Many critics and fans noted the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim",<ref>Gray (2006), p. 423.</ref> written by a 19th-century teacher. In August 1994, he played at [[Woodstock '94]]; ''Rolling Stone'' called his performance "triumphant".<ref name=":R&REncylopedia"/> In November, Dylan recorded two live shows for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by [[Sony]] executives who insisted on hits.<ref>Sounes, pp. 408–409.</ref> The resulting album, ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'', included [[John Brown (song)|"John Brown"]], an unreleased 1962 song about how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.<ref>Heylin (2009), pp. 100–101.</ref>

With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch,<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 693.</ref> Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's [[Criteria Studios]] in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 697.</ref> Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with life-threatening [[pericarditis]], brought on by [[histoplasmosis]]. His scheduled European tour was canceled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon".<ref>Sounes, p. 420.</ref> He was back on the road by mid-year, and performed before [[Pope John Paul II]] at the World Eucharistic Conference in [[Bologna]], Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 to a [[homily]] based on Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind".<ref>Sounes, p. 426.</ref>

In September, Dylan released the new Lanois-produced album, [[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|''Time Out of Mind'']]. With its bitter assessments of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] called it "a thrilling return to form."<ref name=":Ross">{{cite magazine| last=Ross| first=Alex| title=The Wanderer| date=May 2, 1999| magazine=[[The New Yorker]]| url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/05/10/the-wanderer}}</ref> "[[Cold Irons Bound]]" won Dylan another Grammy For Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, and the album won him his first [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/40th-annual-grammy-awards-1997| title=1997 Grammy Winners| date=April 10, 2015| access-date=May 6, 2020| website=grammy.com}}</ref> The album's first single, "[[Not Dark Yet]]", has been called one of Dylan's best songs<ref>{{cite news| last=Docx| first=Edward| title=Beyond Mr. Tambourine Man: 80 Bob Dylan songs everyone should know| work=The Guardian| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/22/beyond-mr-tambourine-man-80-bob-dylan-songs-everyone-should-know}}</ref> and "[[Make You Feel My Love]]" was covered by [[Billy Joel]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Adele]] and others.

In September 2021, Dylan's touring company announced a series of tours which were billed as the "[[Rough and Rowdy Ways World Wide Tour|Rough and Rowdy Ways World Wide Tour, 2021–2024]]". The Rough and Rowdy Ways World Tour replaced Dylan's varied set lists with a more stable repertory, performing nine of the ten songs on his [[Rough and Rowdy Ways|2020 album]]. <ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.mojo4music.com/articles/stories/bob-dylan-live-in-austin-review/#| title =Bob Dylan Live In Austin Review: Latest chapter of The Never Ending Tour comes to a masterful close| author =Blackstock, Peter| date = April 6, 2024| access-date = April 8, 2024| website = mojo4music.com}}</ref> Nevertheless, the tour has been referred to by the media as an extension of his ongoing Never Ending Tour.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Levy|first=Piet|title=Bob Dylan is resuming his 'Never Ending Tour,' beginning with a show at Milwaukee's Riverside Theater|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/09/27/bob-dylan-resuming-his-never-ending-tour-beginning-show-milwaukees-riverside-theater/5883872001/|access-date=2022-01-03|website=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Romantic relationships===
====Echo Helstrom====
[[Echo Helstrom]] was Dylan's high school girlfriend. The couple listened together to rhythm-and-blues on the radio, and her family exposed him to singers such as [[Jimmie Rodgers]] on [[Phonograph record#78 rpm disc developments|78 RPM records]], and a plethora of folk music magazines, sheet music, and manuscripts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.startribune.com/the-original-girl-from-the-north-country-bob-dylan-s-high-school-sweetheart-has-died/470716473/ |title=The original 'Girl From the North Country,' Bob Dylan's high school sweetheart has died |author=Matt Steichen |date=January 25, 2018 |work=[Minneapolis] Star-Tribune |accessdate=October 21, 2021}}{{cite book |last=Dylan |first=Bob |title=Chronicles, Volume 1 |pages=59–60 |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=9780743228152}}{{cite web |url=https://uminnpressblog.com/2018/01/25/lookin-to-get-silly-in-hibbing-toby-thompson-on-echo-star-helstrom-the-girl-from-the-north-country/ |title=Lookin' to get silly in Hibbing: Toby Thompson on Echo Star Helstrom, the 'Girl from the North Country' |author=Toby Thompson |date=January 25, 2018 |work=University of Minnesota Press Blog |accessdate=October 20, 2021}}</ref> Helstrom is believed by some to be the inspiration for Dylan's song "[[Girl from the North Country]]", though this is disputed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/4391880-dylans-presumed-girl-north-country-has-died |title=Dylan's presumed 'Girl from the North Country' has died |author= |date=January 22, 2018 |work=Duluth News-Tribune |url-access=registration |accessdate=October 21, 2021}} {{cite web |url=http://english.la.psu.edu/faculty-staff/cwt1 |title=Penn State professor, biographer reflects on Dylan at 70 |author=Toby Thompson |date=May 20, 2011 |work=Penn State Live |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}(quoted in Thompson's Penn State faculty biography){{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/obituary-echo-helstrom-kqdmkgwxk |title=Echo Helstrom (obituary) |author=<!--staff--> |date=February 3, 2018 |work=The Times |accessdate=October 22, 2021 |quote=[In 1963, Dylan] paid Helstrom an even greater compliment by making her the muse of his folk ballad ''Girl From the North Country''... |url-access=subscription}}{{cite web |url=https://www.startribune.com/the-original-girl-from-the-north-country-bob-dylan-s-high-school-sweetheart-has-died/470716473/ |title=The original 'Girl From the North Country,' Bob Dylan's high school sweetheart has died |author=Matt Steichen |date=January 25, 2018 |work=[Minneapolis] Star-Tribune |accessdate=October 21, 2021}}>{{cite web |url=https://www.record-bee.com/2018/01/25/dylans-girl-from-the-north-country-maybe-dies-in-california/ |title=Dylan's 'Girl from the North Country' (maybe) dies in California |author=Christa Lawler and Digital First Media |date=January 25, 2018 |work=Lake Country Record-Bee |accessdate=October 22, 2021}}{{cite book |last=Heylin |first=Clinton |title=Revolution in the Air: The Songs of Bob Dylan, 1957–1973 |year=2012 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=978-1613743362 |pages=119–121}}</ref>

====Suze Rotolo====
Dylan's first serious relationship was with artist [[Suze Rotolo]], a daughter of [[Communist Party USA]] radicals. According to Dylan, "She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen&nbsp;... The air was suddenly filled with banana leaves. We started talking and my head started to spin".<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles'', 2004, p. 265.</ref> Rotolo was photographed arm-in-arm with Dylan on the cover of his album ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan''. Critics have connected Rotolo to some of Dylan's early love songs, including "[[Don't Think Twice It's All Right]]". The relationship ended in 1964.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 2006, pp. 592–594.</ref> In 2008, Rotolo published a memoir about her life in Greenwich Village and relationship with Dylan in the 1960s, ''A Freewheelin' Time''.<ref>Suze Rotolo, A Freewheelin' Time, Aurum Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84513-392-4}}</ref>

====Joan Baez====
When [[Joan Baez]] met Dylan in April 1961, she had already released her [[Joan Baez (album)|first album]] and was acclaimed as the "Queen of Folk".<ref>Hajdu, ''Positively 4th Street'', 2001, p. 76</ref> On hearing Dylan perform his song "[[With God on Our Side (song)|With God on Our Side]]", Baez later said, "I never thought anything so powerful could come out of that little toad".<ref>{{Cite magazine| url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/04/bob-on-bob| title = Bob on Bob| author = Menand, Louis| date = September 4, 2006| access-date=December 20, 2016| magazine = The New Yorker}}</ref> In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets over the next two years.<ref name=GrayBaez>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 2006, pp. 28–31.</ref> By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.<ref name=GrayBaez/> Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76. Baez also starred as "The Woman In White" in the film ''Renaldo and Clara'' (1978), directed by Dylan.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/martin-scorsese-bob-dylan-documentary| title = Scorsese's New Dylan Documentary Is the Rebirth Myth America Need| author = Hogan, Mike| date = June 10, 2019| access-date = February 22, 2020|newspaper = [[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with [[Carlos Santana]].<ref name=GrayBaez/>

Baez recalled her relationship with Dylan in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s documentary film ''No Direction Home'' (2005). Baez wrote about Dylan in two autobiographies—admiringly in ''Daybreak'' (1968), and less admiringly in ''And A Voice to Sing With'' (1987). Her song "[[Diamonds & Rust (song)|Diamonds & Rust]]" has been described as "an acute portrait" of Dylan.<ref name=GrayBaez/>

====Sara Lownds====
Dylan married [[Sara Lownds]], who had worked as a model and secretary at [[Robert Drew|Drew Associates]], on November 22, 1965.<ref name =Gray198/> They had four children: [[Jesse Dylan|Jesse Byron Dylan]] (born January 6, 1966), Anna Lea (born July 11, 1967), Samuel Isaac Abram (born July 30, 1968), and [[Jakob Dylan|Jakob Luke]] (born December 9, 1969). Dylan also adopted Sara's daughter from a prior marriage, Maria Lownds (later Dylan, born October 21, 1961). Sara Dylan played the role of Clara in Dylan's film ''Renaldo and Clara'' (1978). Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on June 29, 1977.<ref name =Gray198>Gray (2006), pp. 198–200.</ref>

====Carolyn Dennis====
Dylan and his backing singer [[Carolyn Dennis]] (often professionally known as Carol Dennis) have a daughter, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, born on January 31, 1986.<ref>Sounes, pp. 371–373.</ref> The couple were married on June 4, 1986, and divorced in October 1992. Their marriage and child remained a closely guarded secret until the publication of [[Howard Sounes]]'s biography ''Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan'', in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1273409.stm| title = Dylan's Secret Marriage Uncovered| access-date=September 7, 2008|work=BBC News | date = April 12, 2001}}</ref>

===Home===
When not touring, Dylan is believed to live primarily in [[Point Dume]], a promontory on the coast of [[Malibu, California]], though he owns property around the world.<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://variety.com/2013/biz/features/bob-dylan-house-designer-1200406286/| title = Bob Dylan's Designer Brings It All Back Home| author = Chagollan, Steve| date = April 26, 2013| access-date = September 16, 2017| magazine = Variety.com}}</ref><ref name=Marty>{{cite book| last =Newman| first =Martin Alan| title =Bob Dylan's Malibu| publisher =EDLIS Café Press| year =2021| location =Hibbing, Minnesota| isbn =9781736972304}}</ref>

===Religious beliefs===
Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small, close-knit Jewish community, and Dylan had his [[Bar Mitzvah]] in May 1954.<ref>According to Robert Shelton, Dylan's teacher was "Rabbi Reuben Maier of the only synagogue on the [[Iron Range]], Hibbing's Agudath Achim Synagogue". See Shelton, pp. 35–36.</ref><ref name="Haaretz" /> Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], founder of the New York-based [[Jewish Defense League]].<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 328.</ref>

In the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the [[Vineyard Christian Fellowship|Vineyard School of Discipleship]].<ref name =Vineyard>{{cite web| url = http://blog.oup.com/2017/01/bob-dylan-christianity/| title = The year Bob Dylan was born again: a timeline| author = McCarron, Andrew
| date = January 21, 2017| access-date=January 24, 2017| publisher = Oxford University Press
}}</ref> Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen recalled: "Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying yes, he did in fact want Christ in his life. And he prayed that day and received the Lord".<ref>Heylin (2000), ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 494.</ref><ref>Gray, 2006, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 76–80.</ref> From January to March 1979, Dylan attended Vineyard's Bible study classes in [[Reseda, California]].<ref name =Vineyard/><ref>Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 206.</ref>

By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the "[[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]" label. He told [[Kurt Loder]] of ''Rolling Stone'': "I've never said I'm 'born again'. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come."<ref>''Rolling Stone'', June 21, 1984, reprinted in Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 288.</ref> In 1997, he told [[David Gates (author)|David Gates]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'':

{{blockquote|Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like "Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain" or "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]"—that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/dylan-revisited-174056|title=Dylan Revisited|author=Gates, David| date=October 6, 1997|access-date=June 8, 2010|work=Newsweek}}</ref>}}

Dylan has supported the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] movement,<ref>Fishkoff, p. 167.</ref> and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including his sons' Bar Mitzvahs and services at [[Hadar Hatorah]], a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[yeshiva]]. In 1989 and 1991, he appeared on the Chabad [[telethon]].<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 317, 343.</ref>

Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has made passing references to his religious faith, such as in a 2004 interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', when he told [[Ed Bradley]], "the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God". He explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the "chief commander—in this earth and in the world we can't see".<ref name="60minutes2005">{{cite news| url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-bob-dylan-rare-interview-2004/| title = Dylan Looks Back| author = Leung, Rebecca| date = June 12, 2005| access-date=February 25, 2009| work = CBS News}}</ref>

Speaking to Jeff Slate of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in December 2022, Dylan reaffirmed his religious outlook: "I read the scriptures a lot, meditate and pray, light candles in church. I believe in damnation and salvation as well as [[predestination]]. The [[Five Books of Moses]], [[Pauline Epistles]], [[Intercession of saints|Invocation of the Saints]], all of it."<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bobdylan.com/news/bob-dylan-interviewed-by-wall-street-journals-jeff-slate/| title = Bob Dylan Q&A about "The Philosophy of Modern Song"| author = Slate, Jeff| date = December 20, 2022| access-date = December 22, 2022

==Legacy==
Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|''Time'' 100: The Most Important People of the Century]], where he was called "master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation".<ref name="Time100Dylan">{{cite news| url = http://www.shrout.co.uk/TIME%20Bob%20Dylan.html| title = The Time 100: Bob Dylan| author=Cocks, Jay| date = June 14, 1999| access-date=October 5, 2008| work=shrout.co.uk/TIME }}</ref> [[Paul Simon]] suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: "[Dylan's] early songs were very rich&nbsp;... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while."<ref>Fong-Torres, ''The Rolling Stone Interviews, Vol. 2'', p. 424.

For many critics, Dylan’s greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums—''Bringing It All Back Home'', ''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''. In [[Mike Marqusee]]'s words:

{{blockquote|Between late 1964 and the middle of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, [[British beat]], [[Symbolist poetry|symbolist]], [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist]] and [[Beat poetry|Beat]] poetry, [[surrealism]] and [[Dada]], advertising jargon and social commentary, [[Fellini]] and [[Mad magazine|''Mad'' magazine]], he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.<ref name="Marqusee139">Marqusee, p. 139.</ref>}}

Dylan's lyrics began to receive critical study as early as 1998, when [[Stanford University]] sponsored the first international academic conference on Bob Dylan held in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 7, 2017|title=Dylan Conference|url=https://tinomarkworth.com/dylan-conference/|access-date=February 12, 2023|website=tinomarkworth.com|language=en}}</ref> In 2004, [[Richard F.

Dylan's voice also received critical attention. [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] described his early vocal style as "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s".<ref>Shelton, pp. 108–111.</ref> His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" as "at once young and jeeringly cynical".<ref>Gray (2006), p. 413.</ref> As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal ''[[Oral Tradition (journal)|Oral Tradition]]'': <blockquote>Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs—this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in "[[Everything is Broken]]" (on the album ''[[Oh Mercy]]'') is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://journal.oraltradition.org/wp-content/uploads/files/articles/22i/Lebold.pdf| title=A Face like a Mask and a Voice that Croaks: An Integrated Poetics of Bob Dylan's Voice, Personae, and Lyrics| author=Lebold, Christophe| date=March 1, 2007| access-date=May 3, 2010| work=Oral Tradition }}</ref></blockquote>

Dylan's music has inspired artists in other fields. [[Dave Gibbons]] recalls how he and [[Alan Moore]] were inspired by the lines of "[[Desolation Row]]" beginning "At midnight, all the agents/ And the superhuman crew...": <blockquote>It was a glimpse, a mere fragment of something; something ominous, paranoid and threatening.

If Dylan's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music,<ref name="Marqusee139"/> critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. In his review of ''I'm Not There'', [[J. Hoberman]] wrote:

{{blockquote|Elvis might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan.

They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in.

'''Bonnie Lynn Raitt''' ({{IPAc-en|r|eɪ|t}};<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/organization/standards-guidelines/qrst/#r|title=Say How: R|publisher=National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled|access-date=December 31, 2020}}</ref> born November 8, 1949) is an American [[blues rock]] singer, guitarist, and songwriter. In 1971, Raitt released her [[Bonnie Raitt (album)|self-titled debut album]].

She was also a frequent session player and collaborator with other artists, including [[Warren Zevon]], [[Little Feat]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[the Pointer Sisters]], [[John Prine]], and [[Leon Russell]].

==Early life==
Bonnie Lynn Raitt was born on November 8, 1949, in [[Burbank, California]].{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=11}} Her mother, Marge Goddard (née Haydock), was a pianist, and her father, [[John Raitt]], was an actor in [[musical theatre|musical]] productions such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and ''[[The Pajama Game]]''.<ref name="Official Website Biography"/> Raitt is of Scottish ancestry; her ancestors constructed [[Rait Castle]] near [[Nairn]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Italie |first1=Hillel |title=Bonnie Raitt discovers her roots |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19910714&id=R1cyAAAAIBAJ&pg=6928,3407930 |access-date=24 December 2016 |work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=14 July 1991|page=4D}}</ref> As a child, Raitt would often play with her two brothers, Steve and David and was a self-described [[tomboy]].{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=10}} John Raitt's job as a theater actor meant Bonnie did not interact with him as much as she would have liked. Raitt grew to resent her mother, as she became the main authority figure of the household whenever John was away.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}}

Raitt's musically inclined parents had a strong influence on her life. From a young age, she and her brothers were encouraged to pursue music.{{sfn|Bego|1995|pp=12–13}} Initially, Raitt played the piano but was intimidated by her mother's abilities.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}} She instead began playing a [[Stella (guitar)|Stella]] guitar, which she received as a Christmas gift in 1957 at the age of eight.<ref name="Official Website Biography"/>{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}} Raitt did not take lessons; she was instead influenced by the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1950s. She was also influenced by the [[beatnik]] movement, stating "It represented my whole belief [...] I'd grow my hair real long so I looked like a beatnik."{{sfn|Bego|1995|pp=13–14}}

From ages eight through fifteen, Raitt and her brothers attended a [[summer camp]] in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] called Camp Regis.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=13}}{{sfnm|1a1=Schmidt|1a2=Rooney|1y=1979|1p=305}} It was there where Raitt learned of her musical talents, when camp counselors would ask her to play in front of the campers.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=14}} Learning how to play songs from folk albums then became a hobby for Raitt.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=14}} As a teenager, Raitt was self-conscious about her weight and her [[freckle]]s, and saw music as an escape from reality.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=15}} "That was my saving grace. I just sat in my room and played my guitar," said Raitt.{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=15}}

After graduating from [[Oakwood Friends School]] in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1967, Raitt entered [[Radcliffe College]] of [[Harvard University]], majoring in [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Social Relations]] and [[African studies]].<ref name="Official Website Biography">{{cite web|url=https://www.bonnieraitt.com/bio|title=Bonnie Raitt Biography|website=Official Bonnie Raitt website|access-date=April 19, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213020807/http://www.bonnieraitt.com/bio|archive-date=February 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She said her "plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President [[Julius Nyerere]] was creating a government based on democracy and socialism".<ref name="oprah">{{cite journal|url=https://www.oprah.com/spirit/bonnie-raitts-aha-moment|title=Bonnie Raitt's Aha!

Raitt said it was an "opportunity that changed everything."<ref name="oprah" />

==Career==
===1970–1976===
In the summer of 1970, she played with her brother David on stand-up bass with [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]] at the [[Philadelphia Folk Festival]] as well as opening for [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond]] at [[the Gaslight Cafe]] in New York. She was seen by a reporter from ''[[Newsweek]]'', who began to spread the word about her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from [[Warner Bros.]], who soon released her debut album, ''[[Bonnie Raitt (album)|Bonnie Raitt]]'', in 1971.<ref name="LarkinBlues">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Blues]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-673-1|page=300}}</ref> The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.

While admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'', was released in 1972 to positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Bonnie Raiit: Give It Up |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/give-it-up-mw0000196849 |website=AllMusic |access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref> One journalist described the album as "an excellent set" and "established the artist as an inventive and sympathetic interpreter".<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> However, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's ''[[Takin' My Time]]'' was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

Raitt began to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', but with 1974's ''[[Streetlights (Bonnie Raitt album)|Streetlights]]'', reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> By this point, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's ''[[Home Plate (album)|Home Plate]]''. In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].

She was influenced by the playing style of [[Lowell George]], of the band [[Little Feat]], particularly his use of a pre-amp [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] with a [[slide guitar]]. [[B.B. King]] once called Raitt the "best damn slide player working today".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/bonnie-raitt-and-the-fugitive-emotions-evoked-by-slide-guitar | title=Bonnie Raitt and the Fugitive Emotions Evoked by Slide Guitar | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=April 9, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bluesguitarinsider.com/blues-guitarists/lowell-george | title=Lowell George | date=August 2013 }}</ref>

===1977–1988===
[[File:Bonnie Raitt2.jpg|thumb|230px|Raitt performing at the [[Berkeley Community Theater]], 1976–1977]]
1977's ''[[Sweet Forgiveness]]'' album gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough,<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> when it yielded a hit single in her remake of [[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|"Runaway".]] Recast as a heavy [[rhythm and blues]] recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by [[Al Green]], Raitt's version of "Runaway" was disparaged by many critics. However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. "There was this big Columbia–Warner war going on at the time", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. "[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia... And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia – no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal."{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=76}}

Warner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, ''[[The Glow (Bonnie Raitt album)|The Glow]]'', in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Raitt had one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five concerts of [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Those shows spawned the three-record gold album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', as well as a Warner Brothers feature film [[No Nukes (film)|of the same name]], and featured co-founders [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], and Raitt as well as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[James Taylor]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and others.

In 1980, she appeared as herself in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' where she sang "Don't It Make You Wanna Dance".

For her next record, 1982's ''[[Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)|Green Light]]'', Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this had a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

====''Tongue and Groove'' and release from Warner Brothers====
In 1983, Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, ''Tongue and Groove''. The day after mastering was completed on ''Tongue & Groove'', the record company dropped Raitt from its roster, not being happy with her commercial performance up to that point.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> The album was shelved and not released, and Raitt was left without a record contract. At this time Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.<ref name="notbroken">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bonnie-raitt-will-not-be-broken/ |title=Bonnie Raitt Will Not Be Broken |work=[[CBS News]] |last=Benjamin |first=Scott |date=February 18, 2009 |access-date=2012-04-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422171711/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |archive-date=April 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Despite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]", the anti-[[apartheid]] song written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow, Russia]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in [[Los Angeles]] for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and others.

Two years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the ''Tongue and Groove'' album. "I said it wasn't really fair," recalled Raitt. "I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''." That album, released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

In late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, she was clean and sober, having resolved her problems with substance abuse. She later credited [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] for his help in a [[Minnesota State Fair]] concert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |title=Grand stands: A longtime fairgoer's most unforgettable shows |author=Jon Bream |date=August 22, 2002 |publisher=StarTribune.com |access-date=2011-04-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828220833/http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |archive-date=August 28, 2007 }}</ref> the night after Vaughan's 1990 death. During this time, Raitt considered signing with the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-owned [[Paisley Park|Paisley Park Records]], but they could not come to an agreement and negotiations fell through. Instead, she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock songs under the production guidance of [[Don Was]] at [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

Raitt had met Was through [[Hal Willner]], who was putting together ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', a tribute album to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] music for [[A&M Records|A&M]]. Was and Willner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for "[[Baby Mine (song)|Baby Mine]]", the lullaby from ''[[Dumbo]]''. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Was to produce her next album.

===1989–1999: Commercial breakthrough===
[[Image:Bonnie Raitt.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt at the 1990 [[Grammy Awards]]]]
After working with Was on the ''Stay Awake'' album, Raitt's management, Gold Mountain, approached numerous labels about a new record deal and found interest from [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Raitt was signed to Capitol by A&R executive [[Tim Devine]]. With her first Capitol Records release, and after nearly twenty years in the business, Raitt achieved commercial success with ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'', her tenth overall album of her career.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Released in the spring of 1989, ''Nick of Time'' went to number one on the U.S. album chart following Raitt's Grammy sweep in early 1990.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> This album has also been voted number 230 in the ''Rolling Stone'' list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Raitt later stated that her 10th try was "my first sober album."<ref>{{cite magazine

At the same time, Raitt received a fourth [[Grammy Award]] for her duet "[[I'm in the Mood (John Lee Hooker song)|I'm in the Mood]]" with [[John Lee Hooker]] on his album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> ''Nick of Time'' was also the first of many of her recordings to feature her longtime rhythm section of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[James "Hutch" Hutchinson]] (although previously Fataar had played on her ''Green Light'' album and Hutchinson had worked on ''Nine Lives''), both of whom continue to record and tour with her. Since its release in 1989, ''Nick of Time'' has currently sold over five million copies in the US alone.

Raitt followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her next album, 1991's ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'', which sold seven million copies in the United States. Three years later, in 1994, she added two more Grammys with her album ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'', her second number one album, that sold two million copies in the US.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Raitt's collaboration with Don Was amicably came to an end with 1995's live release ''[[Road Tested]]''.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> Released to solid reviews, it was certified [[Music recording certification|gold]] in the US.

"[[Rock Steady (Bonnie Raitt and Bryan Adams song)|Rock Steady]]" was a hit written by [[Bryan Adams]] and [[Gretchen Peters]] in 1995. The song was written as a duet with Bryan Adams and Bonnie Raitt for her Road Tested tour, which also became one of her albums. The original demo version of the song appears on Adams' 1996 single "Let's Make a Night to Remember".

For her next studio album, Raitt hired [[Mitchell Froom]] and [[Tchad Blake]] as her producers. "I loved working with [[Don Was]] but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different," Raitt stated. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on ''[[Fundamental (Bonnie Raitt album)|Fundamental]]'' in 1998.

===2000–2007===

===Drug and alcohol use and recovery===
Raitt was a user of alcohol and drugs, but began [[psychotherapy]] and joined [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] in the late 1980s. "I thought I had to live that partying lifestyle in order to be authentic," she said, "but in fact if you keep it up too long, all you're going to be is sloppy or dead."<ref name="ontheredcarpet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Bonnie-Raitt-talks-new-album--25-years-of-sobriety--Whitney-Houston-Video/8616790|title=Bonnie Raitt talks new album,' 25 years of sobriety and Whitney Houston – 04/11/2012 &#124; Entertainment News from|publisher=OnTheRedCarpet.com|access-date=2014-04-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218153631/http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Bonnie-Raitt-talks-new-album--25-years-of-sobriety--Whitney-Houston-Video/8616790|archive-date=December 18, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She has been sober since 1987.

==Political activism==
[[File:Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt 1997-09-24 61236-12.jpg|thumb|Raitt with musician Jackson Browne at a 1997 press conference opposing the proposed [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]]]]

Raitt's political involvement goes back to the early 1970s. Her 1972 album ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'' had a dedication "to the people of [[North Vietnam]] ..." printed on the back. Raitt's web site urges fans to learn more about preserving the environment. She was a founding member of [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] in 1979 and a catalyst for the larger [[anti-nuclear movement]], becoming involved with groups like the [[Abalone Alliance]] and Alliance for Survival. In 1994 at the urging of [[Dick Waterman]], Raitt funded the replacement of a headstone for one of her mentors, blues guitarist [[Fred McDowell]] through the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]]. Raitt later financed memorial headstones in Mississippi for musicians [[Memphis Minnie]], [[Sam Chatmon]], and [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]] again with the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund.

In 2002, Raitt signed on as an official supporter of [[Little Kids Rock]], a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools throughout the U.S. She has visited children in the program and sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary member.

At the [[Stockholm Jazz Festival]] in July 2004, Raitt dedicated a performance of "Your Good Thing (Is About to End)", from her 1979 album ''[[The Glow (Bonnie Raitt album)|The Glow]]'', to sitting (and later re-elected) U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]. She was quoted as saying "We're gonna sing this for George Bush because he's out of here, people!".{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

In 2008, Raitt donated a song to the [[Aid Still Required]]'s CD to assist with relief efforts in Southeast Asia from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]]. Raitt worked with [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]], a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 fall/winter and 2006 spring/summer/fall tours.<ref>{{cite web

==Guitar==
Raitt's principal touring guitar is a customized [[Fender Stratocaster]] that she nicknamed Brownie. This became the basis for a signature model in 1996. Raitt was the first female musician to receive a signature Fender line.

{{blockquote|My brown Strat—the body is a '65 and the neck is from some time after that. It's kind of a hybrid that I got for $120 at 3 o' clock in the morning in 1969. It's the one without the paint, and I've used that for every gig since 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Bonnie_Raitt_Return_of_the_Blues_Baroness|title=Bonnie Raitt: Return of the Blues Baroness|date=March 9, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223022339/http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Bonnie_Raitt_Return_of_the_Blues_Baroness|archive-date=February 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}

'''Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives''' (June 14, 1909 – April 14, 1995) was an American musician, singer and actor with a career that spanned more than six decades.

Ives began his career as an itinerant singer and guitarist, eventually launching his own radio show, ''The Wayfaring Stranger'', which popularized traditional [[Folk music|folk]] songs. In 1942, he appeared in [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[This Is the Army]]'' and became a major star of [[CBS Radio]]. In the 1960s, he successfully crossed over into [[country music]], recording hits such as "[[A Little Bitty Tear]]" and "[[Funny Way of Laughin']]". Ives was also a popular film actor through the late 1940s and '50s. His film roles included parts in ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1948) and ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), as well as the role of Rufus Hannassey in ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), for which he won an [[31st Academy Awards|Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and the film noir ''[[Day of the Outlaw]]'' (1959).

Ives is often associated with the Christmas season. He did voice-over work as Sam the Snowman, narrator of the classic 1964 Christmas television special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]''. Ives also worked on the [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (soundtrack)|special's soundtrack]], including the songs "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]" and "[[Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]", both of which continue to chart annually on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] holiday charts into the 2020s.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Holiday 100 Chart|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-holiday-songs|access-date=2021-04-21|magazine=Billboard|date=January 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Early life==
Ives was born in [[Hunt City, Illinois|Hunt City]], an unincorporated town in [[Jasper County, Illinois]], near [[Newton, Illinois|Newton]], to Levi "Frank" Ives (1880–1947) and Cordelia "Dellie" (née White; 1882–1954). He had six siblings: Audry, Artie, Clarence, Argola, Lillburn, and Norma. His father was first a farmer and then a contractor for the county and others. One day, Ives was singing in the garden with his mother, and his uncle overheard them. He invited his nephew to sing at the old soldiers' reunion in Hunt City. The boy performed a rendition of the folk ballad "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]" and impressed both his uncle and the audience.<ref>Burl Ives (1948). ''Wayfaring Stranger''. New York: Whittlesey House, pp. 15–20. ISBN 9781787204898</ref>

From 1927 to 1929, Ives attended Eastern Illinois State Teachers College (now [[Eastern Illinois University]]) in [[Charleston, Illinois]], where he played football.<ref>Betsy Cole, "Eastern Mourns Burl Ives", ''Daily Eastern News'', April 17, 1995.</ref> During his junior year, he was sitting in English class, listening to a lecture on ''[[Beowulf]],'' when he suddenly realized he was wasting his time. As he walked out of the door, the professor made a snide remark and Ives slammed the door behind him, shattering the window in the door.<ref>Ives, ''Wayfaring Stranger'' pp. 108–109.</ref> Sixty years later, the school named a building after its most famous dropout.<ref>Associated Press, "Eastern Illinois University Honors Famed Dropout Burl Ives," ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'', May 3, 1990, p. 71. Accessed via NewsBank.</ref> Ives was a member of the Charleston Chapter of [[DeMolay International|The Order of DeMolay]] and is listed in the DeMolay Hall of Fame. He was also initiated into [[Scottish Rite Freemasonry]] in 1927.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140328141228/http://scottishrite.org/headquarters/virtual-tour/burl-ives-museum/ Burl Ives Museum] ''Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite''.</ref> He was elevated to the 33rd and highest degree<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons |title=Famous Freemasons in the course of history |language=en |website=St. John Lodge No 11 F.A.A.M. |access-date=September 30, 2018 |quotation=Magnolia Lodge (now Magnolia-La Cumbre Lodge) No. 242 in Santa Barbara, California.

On July 23, 1929, in [[Richmond, Indiana]], Ives made a trial recording of "Behind the Clouds" for the Starr Piano Company's [[Gennett Records|Gennett]] label, but the recording was rejected and destroyed a few weeks later. In later years Ives did not recall having made the record.<ref>Tony Russell, ''Country Music Records: A Discography, 1921–1942'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 17, 369.</ref>

==Music career==
{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2023}}

===1930s–1940s===
Ives traveled about the U.S. as an itinerant singer during the early 1930s, earning his way by doing odd jobs and playing his [[banjo]]. He was jailed in [[Mona, Utah]], for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and for singing "[[Foggy Dew (English song)|Foggy Dew]]" (an English folk song), which the authorities decided was a [[bawdy song]].<ref>''Wayfaring Stranger'' pp. 129–132.</ref> Around 1931, he began performing on WBOW radio in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. He also went back to school, attending classes at Indiana State Teachers College (now [[Indiana State University]]).<ref>''Wayfaring Stranger'' p. 145.</ref> In 1933, Ives also attended the [[Juilliard School]] in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1938 with a small role in [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s hit musical, ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]''. In 1939, he joined his friend and fellow actor [[Eddie Albert]], who had the starring role in ''The Boys from Syracuse'', in Los Angeles. The two shared an apartment for a while in the [[Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles|Beachwood Canyon]] community of Hollywood.

In 1940, Ives named his own radio show, ''The Wayfaring Stranger'', after one of his ballads. Over the next decade, he popularized several traditional folk songs, such as "Foggy Dew", "[[The Blue Tail Fly]]" (an old [[Blackface minstrelsy|minstrel]] tune now better known as "[[Jimmy Crack Corn]]"), and "[[Big Rock Candy Mountain]]" (an old [[hobo]] song). He was also associated with the [[Almanac Singers|Almanacs]], a folk-singing group which at different times included [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Will Geer]], [[Millard Lampell]], and [[Pete Seeger]]. The Almanacs were active in the [[American Peace Mobilization]] (APM), a far left group initially opposed to American entry into [[World War II]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s pro-Allied policies. They recorded such songs as "Get Out and Stay Out of War" and "Franklin, Oh Franklin".<ref name="revival">{{cite journal |first1=Ron |last1=Eyerman |first2=Scott |last2=Barretta |title=The Folk Music Revival in the United States |journal=[[Theory & Society]] |location=New York City |volume=25 |issue=4 |date=August 1996 |pages=501–543 |doi=10.1007/BF00160675|s2cid=142024250 }}</ref>

In June 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]], the APM abandoned its pacifist stance and reorganized itself into the pro-war American People's Mobilization. Ives and the Almanacs rerecorded several of their songs to reflect the group's new stance in favor of US entry into the war. Among them were "Dear Mr. President" and "Reuben James" (the name of a [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|US destroyer sunk by the Germans]] before the official US entry into the war).<ref name="revival"/>

In early 1942, Ives was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]]. He spent time first at [[Camp Dix]], then at [[Camp Upton]], where he joined the cast of [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[This Is the Army]].'' He attained the rank of corporal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} When the show went to Hollywood, he was transferred to the [[Army Air Force]]s. He was honorably discharged, apparently for medical reasons, in September 1943. Between September and December 1943, Ives lived in California with actor [[Harry Morgan]]. In December 1943, Ives went to [[New York City]] to work for [[CBS Radio]] for $100 a week.<ref>"Testimony of Burl Icle Ives, New York, N.Y. [on May 20, 1952]," ''Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Eighty-Second Congress, Second Session on Subversive Infiltration of Radio, Television, and the Entertainment Industry''. Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1952. Part 2, p. 206.</ref> In 1944, he recorded ''The Lonesome Train'', a ballad about the life and death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], written by [[Earl Robinson]] (music) and Lampell (lyrics).

In 1946, Ives was cast as a singing cowboy in the film ''[[Smoky (1946 film)|Smoky]]''.<ref>[http://www.sitcomsonline.com/photopost/showphoto.php/photo/43959 Burl Ives Biography], ''Sitcoms Online''.</ref>

In 1947, Ives recorded one of many versions of "The Blue Tail Fly", but paired this time with the popular [[Andrews Sisters]] (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne). The flip side of the record was a fast-paced "I'm Goin' Down the Road". Ives hoped the trio's success would help the record sell well, which it did, becoming both a best-selling disc and a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit.<ref>{{cite book| title=Swing It!

His version of the song "[[Lavender Blue]]" became his first hit and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] after Ives introduced it in the 1949 film ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]''.

Music critic [[John Rockwell]] said, "Ives' voice ... had the sheen and finesse of opera without its latter-day [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccinian]] vulgarities and without the pretensions of operatic ritual. It was genteel in expressive impact without being genteel in social conformity. And it moved people".<ref>{{cite book| first=John| last=Rockwell| title=Outsider, John Rockwell on the Arts, 1967–2006| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrKByWgDc-kC&q=ives+voice&pg=PA548| date=May 1, 2009| publisher=Hal Leonard Corp| page=479| isbn=978-0879103675}}</ref>

Ives was identified in the 1950 pamphlet ''[[Red Channels]]'' and [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] as an entertainer with supposed Communist ties.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael D.|last=Murray|title=Encyclopedia of Television News|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|date=1998|page=18}}</ref> In 1952, he cooperated with the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) and agreed to testify, fearful of losing his source of income. Ives's statement to the HUAC ended his blacklisting, allowing him to continue acting in movies, but it also led to a bitter rift between Ives and many folk singers, including [[Pete Seeger]], who accused Ives of naming names and betraying the cause of cultural and political freedom to save his own career. Seeger publicly ridiculed Ives for attempting to distance himself from many of the far left organizations he had supported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturalequity.org/alan-lomax/friends/ives|title = Burl Ives &#124; Association for Cultural Equity}}</ref> In 1993, Ives, by then using a wheelchair, reunited with Seeger during a benefit concert in New York City, having reconciled years earlier.

Ives expanded his appearances in films during this decade. His movie credits include the role of Sam the Sheriff of Salinas, California, in ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', Big Daddy in ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', roles in ''[[Desire Under the Elms (film)|Desire Under the Elms]]'', ''[[Wind Across the Everglades]]'', ''[[The Big Country]]'', for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], ''[[Ensign Pulver]]'', the sequel to ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'', and ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'', based on the [[Graham Greene]] novel.

Barred for a while from American employment, he frequently played on BBC Radio's ''[[Children's Hour]]'', with such favorites as "Big Rock Candy Mountain", "She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain", and "Lavender Blue". Ives also performed at the Royal Coronation festival in 1952 which purportedly was also attended by a young [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney|Paul Mccartney.]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gary James' Interview With Burl Ives |url=https://www.classicbands.com/BurlIvesInterview.html |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=www.classicbands.com}}</ref>

He was the Mystery Guest on the August 7, 1955 and February 1, 1959, episodes of ''[[What's My Line]]''.

===1960s–1990s===
In the 1960s, Ives began singing [[country music]] with greater frequency. In 1962, he released three songs that were popular with both country music and popular music fans: "[[A Little Bitty Tear]]", "Call Me Mister In-Between", and "[[Funny Way of Laughin']]". His records, recorded in Nashville for [[Decca Records]], were produced by [[Owen Bradley]], one of the record producers who (along with [[Chet Atkins]]) helped define the [[Nashville Sound]] style of country music that expanded the music's appeal to a wider audience. Bradley used the [[Nashville A-Team]] of session musicians behind Ives, including the [[Anita Kerr Singers]], which enhanced Ives' appeal. Bradley also produced the recording of Ives's perennial Holiday favorite "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]" in Nashville.

Ives had several film and television roles during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, he sang the folk song, "[[I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]" for a short film of the same name produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjK4pnbW-6o&ab_channel=NFB | title=I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly | website=[[YouTube]] | date=October 26, 2016 }}</ref> In 1962, he starred with [[Rock Hudson]] in ''[[The Spiral Road]],'' which was based on a novel of the same name by [[Jan de Hartog]]. He also starred in Disney's ''[[Summer Magic (film)|Summer Magic]]'' with [[Hayley Mills]], [[Dorothy McGuire]], and [[Eddie Hodges]], and a score by [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert]] and [[Richard M. Sherman|Richard Sherman]]. In 1964, he played the genie in the movie ''[[The Brass Bottle (1964 film)|The Brass Bottle]]'' with [[Tony Randall]] and [[Barbara Eden]].

Ives's "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]" and "Silver and Gold" became Christmas standards after they were first featured in the 1964 NBC-TV presentation of the [[Rankin/Bass]] stop-motion animated family special [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'']]. [[Johnny Marks]] had composed the title song (originally an enormous hit for singing cowboy [[Gene Autry]]) in 1949, and producers [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]] retained him to compose the TV special's soundtrack. Ives voiced Sam the Snowman, the banjo-playing "host" and narrator of the story, explaining how Rudolph used his "nonconformity", as Sam refers to it, to save Christmas from being cancelled due to an impassable blizzard. The following year, Ives rerecorded all three of the Johnny Marks hits which he had sung in the TV special, but with a more "pop" feel. He released them all as singles for the 1965 holiday season, capitalizing on their previous success.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} In 2022, 27 years after his death, "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]", made the [[Billboard Year-End]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Hot 100 Songs | magazine=Billboard | date=January 2, 2013 | url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/hot-100-songs/ | access-date=June 22, 2023}}</ref>

Ives performed in other television productions, including ''[[Pinocchio (1968 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]].''

He starred in short-lived ''O.K. Crackerby!'' (1965–66), a comedy which costarred Hal Buckley, Joel Davison, and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]], about the presumed richest man in the world, which replaced [[Walter Brennan]]'s somewhat similar ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]'' on the ABC schedule from the preceding year.

He played Walter Nichols in the drama ''[[The Bold Ones: The Lawyers]]'' (1969–72), a segment of the [[wheel series]] ''[[The Bold Ones]]''.

Ives narrated the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|1971 season]] highlight film for the [[Washington Commanders|Washington Redskins]] of the [[National Football League]] produced by [[NFL Films]]. The Executive Producer was NFL Films founder [[Ed Sabol]], and chief producer was Ed's son, [[Steve Sabol]]. Ed and Steve Sabol are members of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

Ives occasionally starred in macabre-themed productions. In 1970, for example, he played the title role in ''The Man Who Wanted to Live Forever'', in which his character attempts to harvest human organs from unwilling donors. In 1972, he appeared as old man Doubleday in the episode "The Other Way Out" of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'', in which his character seeks a gruesome revenge for the murder of his granddaughter.

In honor of Ives's influence on American vocal music, on October 25, 1975, he was awarded the [[University of Pennsylvania Glee Club]] Award of Merit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/gleeclub/MEMBERS_merit.html |title = The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit Recipients |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209191432/http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/gleeclub/MEMBERS_merit.html |archive-date=February 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> This award, initiated in 1964, was "established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year who has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression."

When [[America Sings]] opened at [[Disneyland]] in 1974, Ives voiced the main host, Sam Eagle, an [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]].

In 1976, Ives was featured as a main character in ''Little House on the Prairie'' season 3 episode 10 titled "The Hunters". Ives played an old fur trapper who was blind and afraid to leave the comfort and safety of his cabin which he shared with his adult son (Johnny Crawford). In this episode Ives paired off with Laura Ingalls (Melissa Gilbert) to help rescue her injured father who was accidentally shot while hunting for venison.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The Odessa American |location=Odessa, Texas| date=December 19, 1976 | page=101 | title=Burl Ivest Cast as Blind Man | url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-odessa-american-burl-ives-blind-man/123170223/}}</ref>

Ives lent his name and image to the U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]]'s "This Land Is Your Land – Keep It Clean" campaign in the 1970s. He was portrayed with the program's fictional spokesman, [[Johnny Horizon]].

Burl Ives was seen regularly in television commercials for [[Luzianne]] tea for several years during the 1970s and 1980s, when he was the company's commercial spokesman.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jun/30/summertime-perfect-time-southern-style-sw-20110630/| title=Summertime perfect time for Southern-style sweet tea| newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]| first=Jeannie| last=Stone|access-date=2020-03-26| date=June 30, 2011}}</ref>

In 1982 he played Carruthers, a dog trainer, in [[Samuel Fuller]]'s controversial and critically acclaimed film ''[[White Dog (1982 film)|White Dog]]''.

In 1989, Ives officially announced his retirement from show business on his 80th birthday. However, he continued to do occasional benefit concert performances of his own accord until 1993.

James started playing the guitar at 13 and within a year was playing on stage. James has played acoustic sets with his mother, and blues with his older brother.  He has also played with country and rock bands.<ref>Montgomery, James (May 19, 2010).

Before ''American Idol'', he played with his band, The Casey James Band, consisting of James, his brother, Billy Cole (bass), and Jacy McCann (drums). They recorded four songs, including the first song that James ever wrote, "Freezing," back in 2002.

==Musical influences==
James cites blues guitarist [[Doyle Bramhall II]] as a major musical influence and whom he would most like to perform with in his Idol Q&A.<ref name="AI-contCJ"/> Another major influence is [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]; James named Vaughan's ''[[In the Beginning (Stevie Ray Vaughan album)|In the Beginning]]'' (1992) as a formative album in his early years.

<blockquote>I got an album called “In the Beginning” and I learned every note on it, which was easier to do because it was early on in his career [it was recorded in 1980]. I learned all those notes and it opened me up to the blues. When you look what he was doing, a lot of it was covers, and then you go back and start listening to those guys -- the originals Albert King, Freddie King, Albert Collins -- those influences changed me, too.</blockquote>

Other influences cited in the article are southern rockers [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[Pearl Jam]].<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/americanidoltracker/2010/05/casey-james-the-soundtrack-to-my-life.html "Casey James: The soundtrack to my life."]. Idol Tracker. May 19, 2010. LA Times.</ref>

==''American Idol''==
James was a contestant on ''[[American Idol]]'' during its ninth season. He made it to the Top 3 before being eliminated on May 19, 2010. James had tried out for and been selected to compete in the ninth season of ''Idol'' in 2009 in spite of the fact that he had never seen the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2010/03/casey-james-turns-into-a-triple-threat-with-gavin-degraw-and-his-guitar/1 |title=Casey James turns into a triple threat with Gavin DeGraw and his guitar |work=USA Today: Idol Chatter |date=March 2, 2010 |access-date=March 17, 2010}}</ref> He was the oldest contestant to be selected for the Top 24 of the ninth season at the age of 27. James was voted off of the competition on May 19, 2010, and finished in third place. During the finale of ''American Idol'', he performed a duet of "[[Every Rose Has Its Thorn]]" with [[Bret Michaels]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100606165914/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/06/03/bret-michaels-casey-james/ "Bret Michaels And Casey James Hit It Off Right Away: The MTV News Quote Of The Day"]. June 3, 2010. MTV Newsroom. MTV Networks.</ref>

''[[USA Today]]'' music critic [[Brian Mansfield]] suggested that James was "the best guitar player the show [''American Idol''] has seen."<ref>{{cite news |title=Here's the scoop on the 'American Idol' Chosen 12 |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |date=March 12, 2010 |access-date=March 17, 2010 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2010-03-12-idolfinalists12_ST_N.htm |work=USA Today |quote=Casey James: Arguably the broadest musical background of the 12 and best guitar player the show has seen.}}</ref>

Crockett noted "I taught myself how to play and started to write songs immediately, without any chord knowledge or anything. I didn't know what key I was in for 12 years, but my ear was really good, and I could play in any key and any chord. I just didn't know what it was."<ref name="Austin" /> His early musical influences came from hearing [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and he became fascinated with the [[sampling (music)|samples]] used.  Crockett said, "I got into [[Curtis Mayfield]] through samples of his songs by other artists, and [[Nina Simone]] was through a sample. Even [[J. Cole]], I was listening to a song of his ("Kenny Lofton"), and it was based on the sample from [[the Manhattans]] version of '[[Hurt (Roy Hamilton song)|Hurt]]{{'"}}.<ref name="Chron" />

Crockett played music on the streets in the French Quarter of New Orleans and in [[Deep Ellum, Dallas]] as a teenager. Later he traveled further afield by hitchhiking and riding freight, and by 2009 he was busking in New York City.<ref name="Dmag"/><ref name="AMG"/> As he improved his performance skills, Crockett organized a street band called the Trainrobbers, which caught the attention of a Manhattan-based representative for [[Sony Music]].

==Biography==
Poole was born near the mill town of [[Franklinville, North Carolina]]. He was the son of John Philip Poole and Elizabeth Johnson. In 1918, he moved to the town of Spray, [[North Carolina]], now part of [[Eden, North Carolina|Eden]]. As a child, he learned to play the [[banjo]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He played [[baseball]], and his three-fingered technique was the result of an accident.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Whilst betting that he could catch a baseball without a glove, the ball broke his thumb as he closed his hand too soon, resulting in a permanent arch in his right hand.

Poole bought his first banjo, an Orpheum No. 3 Special, with profits from making [[moonshine]]. He later appeared in the 1929 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Company]] catalog to promote their banjo.

He spent much of his adult life working in [[textile mills]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

=== The North Carolina Ramblers ===
[[File:MilwaukeeBlues.ogg|thumb|Milwaukee Blues]]
Poole and his brother-in-law, fiddle player [[Posey Rorer]], whom he had met in [[West Virginia]] in 1917 and whose sister he married, formed a trio with guitarist Norman Woodlief<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> called the North Carolina Ramblers.<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> They auditioned in [[New York (state)|New York]] for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> After signing a contract, they recorded "Don't Let Your Deal Go Down Blues" on July 27 1925.<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> This song was successful, selling over 106,000 copies at a time when there were estimated to be only 6,000 [[phonograph]]s in the southern [[United States]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}, according to Poole's biographer and great-nephew, Kinney Rorrer. The band was paid $75 for the session.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rorrer |first=Kinney |date=2015 |title=The North Carolina Rambler: Charlie Poole |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26341083 |journal=Appalachian Journal |volume=42 |issue=3/4 |pages=255 |jstor=26341083 |via=JSTOR}}</ref>

For the next five years, Poole and the Ramblers were a popular band.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The band's sound remained consistent, although several members came and left (including Posey Rorer and Norm Woodlief).<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The band recorded over 60 songs for Columbia Records during the 1920s, including "Sweet Sunny South", "White House Blues", "He Rambled", and "Take a Drink on Me". Former [[railroad engineer]] [[Roy Harvey (musician)|Roy Harvey]] was one of the [[Guitarist|guitarists]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> [[Fiddle|Fiddlers]] in various recording sessions were Posey Rorer, Lonnie Austin and Odell Smith.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

[[Bill C. Malone]], in his history of country music, ''Country Music, U.S.A.'', says, "The Rambler sound was predictable: a bluesy fiddle lead, backed up by long, flowing, melodic guitar runs and the finger-style banjo picking of Poole. Predictable as it may be, it was nonetheless outstanding. No string band in early country music equaled the Ramblers' controlled, clean, well-patterned sound."<ref>''Country Music, U.S.A.'', Bill C. Malone, [[University of Texas Press]], 2002</ref>

Poole composed few of his recordings, mostly covering old folk songs. Nevertheless, his dynamic renditions were popular with a broad audience in the Southeast United States. He is considered a primary source for [[old-time music]] revivalists and aficionados. Songs like "Bill Morgan and His Gal", "Milwaukee Blues", and "Leavin' Home", have been resurrected by banjo players. Poole developed a unique fingerpicking style, a blend of melody, arpeggio, and rhythm (distinct from [[Clawhammer|clawhammer/ frailing]] and [[Earl Scruggs|Scruggs]]' variations).<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Poole had been invited to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to play background music for a film, but died before this could happen in May 1931.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His cause of death was a heart attack due to alcohol poisoning.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> According to some reports, he had been disheartened by the slump in record sales due to the [[Great Depression|Depression]].

==Legacy==
Poole's music saw a revival in the 1960s, most likely due to his inclusion on the 1952 ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'', and his renditions have been re-recorded by numerous artists, such as [[John Mellencamp]] with "White House Blues", [[The Chieftains]], [[New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Holy Modal Rounders]] and [[Hot Tuna]] with "Hesitation Blues", and [[Joan Baez]] with "Sweet Sunny South". The [[Grateful Dead]]'s popular song "Deal" was influenced by "Don't Let Your Deal Go Down".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} His recordings have also appeared on numerous compilations of [[old-time music]]. Since 1995, Poole's legacy has been carried on every year in Eden, North Carolina, during the month of June when the Piedmont Folk Legacies, Inc, a non-profit organization, hosts the Charlie Poole Music Festival. [[Bob Dylan]] in his [[Nobel Lecture]] acknowledged Poole and several lyrics of his song "You Ain't Talkin To Me".<ref>{{cite speech |last=Dylan |first=Bob |title=Bob Dylan—Nobel Lecture |date=June 4, 2017 |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2016/dylan-lecture.html |access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>

Columbia issued a three-CD box set of his music, entitled ''You Ain't Talkin' to Me: Charlie Poole and the Roots of Country Music'' in 2005. The album, produced by Henry "Hank" Sapoznik, was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s. It chronicles the music made for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] by Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers between 1925 and 1931, including such important songs as "Don't Let Your Deal Go Down", "Can I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?", "Old and Only in the Way" (the title of which was used by Jerry Garcia to name his 1970s bluegrass band with [[David Grisman]], Old and in the Way), and "White House Blues", adapted by John Mellencamp, who in 2004 updated the politically charged lyrics and changed the title to "To Washington". In addition to 43 of Poole's original recordings, the package features performances by other early roots music players and singers, including [[Fred Van Eps]], [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]], [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], Floyd Country Ramblers, [[Uncle Dave Macon]] and [[The Red Fox Chasers]].

The original liner notes, by [[Peter Stampfel]], state, "Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers recorded an incredible number of songs that are personal favorites of mine. Poole is, in fact, one of the great musicians of the century. No doubt about it." The album's cover art was created by [[Robert Crumb]], the celebrated illustrator and an old-time music aficionado.

Kinney Rorer penned a biography of Charlie Poole, entitled ''Ramblin' Blues: The Life and Songs of Charlie Poole'' in 1982. Rorer is a descendant of Poole's fiddler Posey Rorer, and is the banjo player for the old-time music group The New North Carolina Ramblers.

A double-CD album paying tribute to Poole was released by singer-songwriter [[Loudon Wainwright III]] in August 2009. The album, entitled ''[[High Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project]]'', features 30 tracks, including new versions of songs originally recorded by Poole, as well as tunes composed by Wainwright and producer Dick Connette on the artist's life and times; it was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]].

==''American Idol''==
Bowersox auditioned for ''American Idol'' in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She sang "[[Piece of My Heart]]". Guest judge [[Shania Twain]] commented that she had a "raw, natural talent."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/Bowersox+Idol+idolize/3056262/story.html |title= Bowersox an Idol to idolize |author= Alex Strachan |publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date= May 21, 2010 |access-date= July 30, 2010}}</ref>

On March 2, 2010, Bowersox was hospitalized due to [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) from [[type 1 diabetes]], forcing a last minute switch in scheduling to give her extra time to recuperate. Bowersox confirmed the illness on the May 19, 2010 results show during an interview with host [[Ryan Seacrest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cnmnewsnetwork.com/11618/crystal-bowersox-hospital-2010-american-idol-contestant-hospitalized-for-diabetes/ |title=Crystal Bowersox Hospital: 2010 American Idol Contestant Hospitalized for Diabetes? |author=Bella Horton |publisher=CNN |date=March 3, 2010 |access-date=March 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306130832/http://cnmnewsnetwork.com/11618/crystal-bowersox-hospital-2010-american-idol-contestant-hospitalized-for-diabetes/ |archive-date=March 6, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959174/crystal-bowersoxs-american-idol-future-uncertain |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'American Idol' Future Uncertain |agency=Associated Press |date=March 3, 2010 |access-date=March 25, 2010}}</ref> The men competed that day instead of the women.

The following week, her strong performance prompted [[Simon Cowell]] to state, "Right now, you are the one everyone has to beat."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633573/20100309/story.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312132906/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633573/20100309/story.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 12, 2010 |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'Give Me One Reason' Dominates 'American Idol' |author=James Montgomery |publisher=MTV |date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=March 25, 2010}}</ref>

After [[Siobhan Magnus]]'s elimination from the top 6 of ''[[American Idol]]'', Bowersox became the last remaining female contestant in the competition.

Bowersox was the first female contestant to make it to the finale since [[Jordin Sparks]] won the title in 2007. She is also the first contestant in ''American Idol'' history to have one of their original songs played on the show, or at least during their hometown package.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slezak |first=Michael |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/05/22/american-idol-crystal-bowersox-lee-dewyze/ |title='Idolatry': Breaking down the Crystal-Lee finale (and bidding adieu to Casey) on 'American Idol' |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 22, 2010 |access-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref> Crystal's original song "Holy Toledo" was played on the May 19 Top 3 Results show as the background music for her homecoming package - when she returned to Toledo, Ohio and Elliston, Ohio the previous weekend - and segued into her live performance of the same song at "Bowerstock".

During her time on ''Idol'', Bowersox dated Tony Kusian, but the couple broke up just hours before the ''Idol'' finale.<ref>{{cite news | title = Crystal Bowersox and Boyfriend Split Before Idol Finale | publisher = People | date = May 27, 2010 | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20420919,00.html | access-date = September 25, 2010 | archive-date = September 28, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100928121354/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20420919,00.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>

On the final performance day, in [[Simon Cowell]]'s final critique on ''American Idol'', he called her performance of "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]" "outstanding" and "by far, the best performance and song of the night".

On May 26, 2010, Bowersox was named runner-up to winner [[Lee DeWyze]]. She announced that after her ''Idol'' career, she wants to bring more awareness to type 1 diabetes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2010/05/crystal-bowersox-and-lee-dewyze-dish-on-judges-picks-why-viewers-should-vote-for-them/1/ |title=Crystal Bowersox and Lee DeWyze dish on judges' picks, why viewers should vote for them|date=May 20, 2010|work=USA Today|access-date=May 30, 2010}}</ref>

Bowersox is the third ''Idol'' Runner-Up (preceded by [[Clay Aiken]] and [[David Archuleta]]) to never be in the Bottom 3 or Bottom 2.

* <small>{{note|1|Note 1}} Due to the judges using their one 'save' for [[Michael Lynche]], the Top 9 remained intact for another week.</small>
* <small>{{note|2|Note 2}} Though Crystal Bowersox was the last contestant announced to be 'safe' and moving on to the Top 3, [[Ryan Seacrest]] stressed on the Top 4 Results Night that 'safe' contestants would be announced "in no particular order."<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_20368739.html]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515045646/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20312226_20368739.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}</ref> Thus, the audience has no way of knowing which of the Top 3 was the second-lowest vote-getter that night after [[Michael Lynche]], who was eliminated.</small>

==Post-''Idol'' career==
On May 27, 2010, one day after Bowersox's second place ''Idol'' finish, it was announced that she had signed with [[19 Entertainment]]/[[Jive Records]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/television/29arts-AMERICANIDOL_BRF.html?ref=todayspaper/ |title=''American Idol'' Finalists Sign Record Deals|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 28, 2010 |access-date=May 28, 2010|last1=Itzkoff |first1=Compiled by Dave }}</ref> Her single "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]" has since been released to radio stations and iTunes.

== Early life ==
Shawanda was born in [[Wiikwemkoong First Nation]], [[Manitoulin Island|Manitoulin Island, Ontario]].  Where she began performing at 6 years old, she began acting with Debajemujig Theatre when she was 9, and began getting paid when she was 10, and recorded her first album in Nashville,TN, with Canadian producer Gary Buck, when she was 13. She spent her first 3 years of high school in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]], where she attended Korah C.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sootoday.com/local-entertainment/crystal-shawanda-finds-her-wings-604507|title=Crystal Shawanda finds her wings|work=SooToday.com|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en|archive-date=2018-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315004217/https://www.sootoday.com/local-entertainment/crystal-shawanda-finds-her-wings-604507|url-status=live}}</ref> Her surname translates to "Dawn of a New Day",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hearsomethingcountry.com/artists/shawanda.html|title=HearSomethingCountry.com|date=June 2, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602084339/http://hearsomethingcountry.com/artists/shawanda.html|archive-date=2008-06-02}}</ref> which was the inspiration of the title track of her debut album of the same name.

At 16 Crystal moved to Nashville,TN,where she busked on street corners, and sitting in at Songwriters rounds, she moved back home to Wiikwemkoong for a couple years, and then back to Nashville again, she went back and forth one more time before permanently making it her home, and has been a resident ever since. Upon returning the final time she played for tips at the world famous Tootsie's Orchid Lounge,down on Broadway. She signed a publishing deal with Island Bound Music in 2014,and then signed a production deal with Scott Hendricks in 2015, and signed with RCA records in 2016.

Many of Shawanda's songs have been inspired by her connections to Wiikwemkoong and part of her 2016 album was recorded at the Debajehmujig Creation Centre in [[Assiginack|Manitowaning, Manitoulin Island]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|title=Crystal Shawanda talks about her two new albums set to release this summer|last=Burridge|first=Robin|date=2016-04-27|work=Manitoulin Expositor|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070442/http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|archive-date=2018-03-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Music career==
Shawanda's first album, ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]'', was released in Canada on June 24, 2008, and in the United States on August 19. The album entered the Canadian Country Albums chart at number 2, and the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart at number 16. It became the highest charted album by a full-blooded Canadian First Nations country artist in the SoundScan era.<ref>[http://www.sonybmgnashville.com/pressreleases/details.cfm?artistid=1000010&pressid=1000520]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

Shawanda toured with various artists across Canada and the northern United States in 2008. In 2009, she toured Canada and the United States with [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Dierks Bentley]] as a special guest on the Paisley Party 2009 tour. Her first single, "You Can Let Go", peaked at number 21 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. In mid-2009, Shawanda left RCA Nashville and, through her own record label, New Sun Records, and a distribution deal with EMI released a Christmas album titled ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''.

In 2010, Shawanda released a single, "Beautiful Day", via her own label, New Sun Records. Shawanda also performed at the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in 2010, performing "Let's Come Together" and "This Is My Land".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |title=Crystal Shawanda to Perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade « Nashville.com |accessdate=2014-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222192231/http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref> She then released another single, "Love Enough", on August 15, 2011, in both Canada and the United States, and in promotion she went on to tour with Reba. Shawanda's second studio album, ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]'', was released by New Sun on April 24, 2012, and won a Juno award for Aboriginal Album of the year in 2013. She became the first full blood Indigenous woman as the CEO of a record label, to procure these milestones.

In 2014, Shawanda made a departure from country music and released a Blues album titled "The Whole World's got the Blues",she focused on rather than regurgitating someone else's blues, she told her story as an Indigenous woman in "Pray Sister Pray", which raised awareness of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous women issue, across Canada. She filmed a music video in her hometown with the help of her community, and the music video is now being used in schools across Canada, as a teaching tool of this rising issue. This album was nominated for "Aboriginal Album of the year", and Shawanda was invited to perform at the Juno Awards opening Gala.

In 2016, Shawanda released her 4th album "Fish out of water", feeling torn between her future and her past, the album had a mix of Blues and country music songs, which ended up having am Americana sound. Perhaps best said by DMME.net "She's a force of nature, Crystal Shawanda, the Canadian singer may reside in Nashville, but her casting as a country artist, whitewashed as the genre demands, is hopefully over".

In 2017, Shawanda released "Voo Doo Woman", consisting of 6 covers of blues standards, and 4 originals. Later that year Crystal signed a record deal with True North Records, who rereleased the album later that year, and they achieved moderate airplay at Blues Radio in America.

In 2020, Shawanda released "Church House Blues",which had extensive airplay at Blues Radio in America, and in Europe. She also went on to become the first Indigenous woman to win a Juno award for "Blues album of the year".

In 2022 Crystal released "Midnight Blues", which debuted at #8 on the American Billboard blues chart, and she became the first full blood Indigenous person to appear on this chart. She also received extensive airplay at Blues radio. This album was also nominated for "blues album of the year" at the Juno awards.

The Devil's Carnival]]'', stating that Darren Bousman, Terrance Zdunich and Sean DeMott invited him to the first film's premiere in Los Angeles, after which he was invited to be in its sequel, while he was excited he had to cancel since it initially clashed with tour times, however, after the tour was cancelled he asked to be involved again and was written into the film to play the part of the blacksmith-type character called "the Smith".<ref name=":0" /> After his involvement he went and got a manager and an agent and is looking for another project.

== Personal life ==
Worsnop has had a history of [[substance abuse]] and [[alcoholism]], even appearing [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] during a 2011 performance by Asking Alexandria, which eventually led to Worsnop seeking help via [[drug rehabilitation]].<ref name="Am I Insane – biography" /><ref>{{cite web|title = Asking Alexandria plead onstage for frontman to go to rehab – News – Alternative Press|url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/asking_alexandria_plead_onstage_for_frontman_to_go_to_rehab|website = Alternative Press|access-date = 17 February 2016}}</ref> Snippets from the audio of the incident were included on the intro part of the song "Don't Pray for Me" from the band's third studio album ''[[From Death to Destiny]]'', released in 2013. He dedicated the song "Room 138" to an incident where he claims he overdosed. The song is the closing track on the band's [[Asking Alexandria (album)|self-titled fifth album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/asking_alexandria_self_titled_track_by_track/2|title=Asking Alexandria self-titled track-by-track: The stories behind each song|website=AltPress|access-date=24 May 2020|date=13 December 2017}}</ref> According to [[Ben Bruce]], Worsnop re-joined the band in 2016 "completely sober".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/asking-alexandria-ben-bruce-like-a-house-on-fire-slipknot-sobriety-2669600|title=Asking Alexandria: "Corey Taylor told us this record would piss people off"|website=NME|access-date=24 May 2020|date=15 May 2020}}</ref>

During his initial leaving of Asking Alexandria in January 2015, he fell into conflict with some of the other members, particularly Ben Bruce, who was said to be his "best friend".

==Hootie & the Blowfish==
Darius Rucker has been the lead singer of [[Hootie & the Blowfish]] since its formation in 1986. He met fellow band members [[Mark Bryan]], [[Jim Sonefeld|Jim "Soni" Sonefeld]],<ref name="Puterbaugh" /> and [[Dean Felber]] while attending the [[University of South Carolina]].

As the frontman, Rucker began to be called simply "Hootie" by fans,<ref name="cohen">Cohen, Rich (August 10, 1995), "Southern comfort". ''Rolling Stone'' (714):42</ref> though the band title combines the nicknames of his college friends.<ref name="Gray" /> Before his rise to fame, he lived in the basement of the [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] house at the University of South Carolina, attempting to launch his career through the college bar scene.

Rucker's signature contribution to the band is his baritone voice, which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has called "ingratiating,"<ref>DeCurtis, Anthony, David Wild (May 13, 1999). "Rock + roll." ''Rolling Stone'' (812):60</ref> ''[[TIME]]'' has called "low, gruff, [and] charismatic,"<ref name="Farley" /> and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' has characterized as a "barrelhouse growl."<ref name="browne">Browne, David (April 26, 96), "`Fairweather' report". ''Entertainment Weekly'' (324):55</ref> Rucker said they "flipped" the formula of the all black band with a white frontman, like [[Frank Sinatra]] performing with [[Count Basie]].<ref name="cohen" /> Musically, he has sometimes been criticized or spoofed for not being "black enough".<ref name="Kennedy" /> ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ran a sketch of [[Tim Meadows]] playing Rucker leading beer-drinking, white [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in a counter-march to [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s [[Million Man March]].<ref name="Farley" /><ref name="Balwin">Baldwin, Kristen (November 3, 1995), "The week".

(299):54</ref> He also received death threats for singing the Hootie song "Drowning," a protest song against the flying of the [[Confederate flag]] above the South Carolina statehouse.<ref name="Farley" />

Shortly after gaining a measure of fame, Felber and Rucker (who consider themselves best friends) moved into an apartment in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].<ref name="Kennedy" /> With Rucker's recognition as the frontman of a successful band came increased opportunities. In October 1995, he was asked to sing the national anthem at the [[World Series]].<ref name="Balwin" /> Frank Sinatra invited him to sing at his 80th birthday party; he sang "[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]."<ref>Russell, Lisa, Carolyn Ramsay (December 4, 1995).

In regard to the future of Hootie & the Blowfish, Rucker was quoted by CBS news as stating in late 2011, "I don't think we'll ever break up totally. We're Hootie & the Blowfish. ...

'''David Allan Coe''' (born September 6, 1939) is an American singer and songwriter.<ref>Tucker, Stephen R. (1998). "David Allan Coe." In ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p.&nbsp;102.</ref> Coe took up music after spending much of his early life in reform schools and prisons, and first became notable for [[busking]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He initially played mostly in the [[blues]] style, before transitioning to [[country music]], becoming a major part of the 1970s [[outlaw country]] scene. His biggest hits include "[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]", "[[Longhaired Redneck (song)|Longhaired Redneck]]",  "[[The Ride (David Allan Coe song)|The Ride]]", "[[Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile]]", and "[[She Used to Love Me a Lot]]".

His most popular songs performed by others are the number-one hits "[[Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone) (song)|Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)]]"  sung by [[Tanya Tucker]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]]'s rendition of "[[Take This Job and Shove It]]". The latter inspired [[Take This Job and Shove It (film)|the movie of the same name]]. Coe's rebellious attitude, wild image, and unconventional lifestyle set him apart from other country performers, both winning him legions of fans and hindering his mainstream success by alienating the music industry establishment. Coe continues to be a popular performer on the country music circuit.

== Biography ==
Coe was born in [[Akron, Ohio]],<ref name="Brennan" /> on September 6, 1939.<ref>{{cite web |title=David Allan Coe |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-allan-coe-p1560/charts-awards/billboard-singles/peak_pos-asc |access-date=August 21, 2011 |website=AllMusic}}</ref> His favorite singer as a child was [[Johnny Ace]].<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/15/twisted-tales-david-allan-coe-takes-the-outlaw-country-lifestyl/ |title=Twisted Tales: David Allan Coe Takes the Outlaw Country Lifestyle to the Extreme |author=James Sullivan |date=January 15, 2010 |publisher=Spinner |access-date=August 21, 2011 |archive-date=September 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921054215/http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/15/twisted-tales-david-allan-coe-takes-the-outlaw-country-lifestyl/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> After being sent to the Starr Commonwealth For Boys reform school at the age of nine, he spent much of the next two decades in correctional facilities, including three years at the [[Ohio Penitentiary]]. Coe said he received encouragement to begin writing songs from [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], with whom he had spent time in prison.<ref name=Leroy />

After concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a [[hearse]] which he parked in front of the [[Ryman Auditorium]] while he performed on the street. He caught the attention of [[Shelby Singleton]], owner of the independent record label [[Plantation Records]] and signed a contract with his label.<ref name=Brennan>{{cite book |author=Sandra Brennan |others=[[Michael Erlewine]] | title=All Music Guide to Country |year=1997 |isbn=0-87930-475-8 |pages=95–96 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation }}</ref> Coe is a retired member of the [[Louisville, Kentucky]], chapter of the [[Outlaws Motorcycle Club]].<ref>[https://www.countrythangdaily.com/david-allan-coe/ 10 Badass David Allan Coe Facts You Should Know] countrythangdaily.com (March 27, 2022) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221002210608/https://www.countrythangdaily.com/david-allan-coe/ |date=October 2, 2022 }}</ref><ref name=Nash>{{Cite book|title = Behind Closed Doors: Talking with the Legends of Country Music |first=Alanna |last=Nash |year= 1988 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=9780815412588 |pages=85}}</ref>

He is the father of Tyler Mahan Coe, the creator of the ''[[Cocaine & Rhinestones]]'' podcast, which chronicles the history of country music. He has four children (Tyler, Tanya, Shyanne and Carson) with Jody Lynn Coe. <ref name="NYer_Larson_7Mar18">{{cite news |last1=Larson |first1=Sarah |date=7 March 2018 |title="Cocaine & Rhinestones," an Addictive, Sparkling Podcast About Country Music |work=NewYorker.com |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/cocaine-and-rhinestones-an-addictive-sparkling-podcast-about-country-music |accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>

== Music career ==

=== Early career (1970–1975) ===

Early in 1970, Coe released his debut album, ''[[Penitentiary Blues]]'', followed by a tour with [[Grand Funk Railroad]].<ref name=Brennan /> In October 1971, he signed as an exclusive writer with Pete and Rose Drake's publishing company Windows Publishing Company, Inc. in Nashville, Tennessee, where he remained until 1977. Although he developed a cult following with his performances, he was not able to develop any mainstream success, but other performers achieved charting success by recording songs Coe had written, including [[Billie Jo Spears]]' 1972 recordings "Souvenirs & California Mem'rys" and [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 1973 single "Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)", which was a No. 1 hit and responsible for Coe becoming one of Nashville's hottest songwriters and Coe himself being signed by [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=Brennan /> Coe recorded his own version of the song for his second Columbia album, ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'', released in 1975.<ref name=AllmusicRhyme /> [[AllMusic]] writer Thom Jurek said of the song, "The amazing thing is that both versions are definitive."<ref name=AllmusicRhyme>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/once-upon-a-rhyme-r105958/review |title=Once Upon a Rhyme – David Allan Coe |website=Allmusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

Unlike Coe's first two albums, his third showed full commitment to country music, and Coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as [[outlaw country]]. The title of Coe's third album, ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'', refers to the gimmick Coe adopted several years before [[Glen Campbell]] had a hit with the song "[[Rhinestone Cowboy]]": dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a Lone Ranger mask. The singer later recalled to Michael Buffalo Smith in 2004, "I guess I have to blame it on [[Mel Tillis]]. I met him when I first went to Nashville and he had an office down on [[Music Row]]. I was over there talking to him in his office, and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits. I just freaked out on that. He looked at me and said 'You like that shit, I don't even wear those, if you want 'em take 'em!' He gave me those rhinestone suits and I wore them everywhere."<ref name="swampland">{{cite web|url=http://swampland.com/articles/view/title:david_allan_coe|title=The Original Outlaw: David Allan Coe|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=June 2004|work=Swampland.com|access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Coe maintained the idea for the mask came from his father:

{{blockquote| Then I got the mysterious rhinestone thing from my father. He asked me, 'You know the only way that [[The Lone Ranger]] can go into town? I said, 'No, I don't know what you mean.' He said that he has to take his mask off. I thought, what is my dad talking about and trying to tell me? He said, 'Well son, you have to wear a mask and then when you don't want to be David Allan Coe, you can take your mask off and go anywhere and not be like [[Elvis]] with people messin' with you all the time.'<ref name="swampland"/>}}

Coe's second album ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'' contains one of his biggest hits, "[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]", written by [[Steve Goodman]] and [[John Prine]] and which first appeared on Goodman's 1971 debut release. Coe's version became his first country Top 10 hit single, peaking at No. 8 in 1975, and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with Goodman, who stated the song he had written was the 'perfect country and western song'. Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of [[cliché]]s: "mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk". Goodman's equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coe's requirements, and upon receiving it, Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the 'perfect country and western song' and included the last verse on the record:

<blockquote>Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison<br/>And I went to pick 'er up in the rain<br/>But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck<br/>She got runned over by a damned ol' train</blockquote>

Coe was a featured performer in ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'', a 1975 documentary film by [[James Szalapski]]. Other performers featured included [[Guy Clark]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Steve Earle]], and the [[Charlie Daniels]] Band. Coe also wrote "Cocaine Carolina" for [[Johnny Cash]] and sang background vocals on the recording that appeared on Cash's 1975 album ''[[John R. Cash (album)|John R. Cash]]''.

=== Outlaw years (1976–1982) ===

By 1976, the [[outlaw country]] movement was in full swing as artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way. Coe, however, was still somewhat an outsider, almost too outlaw for the outlaws, a predicament summed up well by AllMusic:

{{blockquote|His wild, long hair; multiple earrings; flashy, glitzy rhinestone suits; Harley Davidson biker boots; and football-sized belt buckles had become obstacles to getting people to take him seriously as a recording artist. Other singers continued to record and succeed with his material, but he  himself – who was as good a singer as almost anyone and better than most – languished in obscurity. Rather than tone it down, Coe characteristically shoved the stereotypes in their faces. He retired the Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy persona and billed his new album as 'David Allan Coe Rides Again as the Longhaired Redneck', something equally off-putting to institution types.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy – David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>}}

''Longhaired Redneck'' was Coe's third album for Columbia in three years, and the first where he wrote or co-wrote all the songs; the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track, which recounts playing in a dive "where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying they'll get out of here alive".  The song features Coe impersonating the vocal styles of [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], and [[Merle Haggard]].  About the term "Longhaired Redneck", Coe later said, "It was terminology that I'd made up at the time. I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie. Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out, take their money and that they'd say, 'I won't do nothin' about it'."<ref name="review-mag">{{cite web|url=https://www.review-mag.com/archive/570-579/577/Ncoeinterview.htm|title=An Exclusive Interview with David Allan Coe|last=Engelhardt|first=Kristofer|date=January 2003|work=Review|access-date=January 14, 2020|archive-date=October 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221002211023/https://www.review-mag.com/archive/570-579/577/Ncoeinterview.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

By 1977, the outlaw movement was nearing its apex, having seen the release of [[Willie Nelson]]'s blockbuster album ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' and country music's first platinum selling album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''. Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre, and began saying so in his music. As noted in [[AllMusic]]'s review of the album, "On ''[[Rides Again (David Allen Coe album)|Rides Again]]'', by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movement's two progenitors on the opening track, "Willie, Waylon, and Me"...Coe already set up self-parody unintentionally – something that continued to curse him."<ref name="Allmusic" /> The songs on ''Rides Again'' cross-fade without the usual silences between tracks, which was unusual for country music, and feature Coe's heavily [[Phaser (effect)|phased]] guitar. Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks, a major concession for Columbia at the time. However, some of his peers resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company, and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws.<ref name=streiss>{{Cite book|title = Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville |first=Michael |last=Streissguth |year= 2013 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0062038180 |pages=155–157}}</ref> Jennings' drummer Richie Albright called Coe "a great, great songwriter. A great singer. But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie he'd made up. Waylon didn't make him comfortable enough to hang around. But Willie did. I was around Willie quite a bit and David Allan was with him eighty percent of the time.

{{blockquote|He wrote a song called "Waylon, Willie, and Me" at the same time he started taking pot-shots at us in interviews, saying that Willie [Nelson] and Kris [Kristofferson] had sold out, that I was running around wearing white buck shoes, and none of us were really an Outlaw. He was the only Outlaw in [[Nashville]]...I saw him in Fort Worth and I put my finger right up to his chest. 'You gotta knock that shit off', I told him. 'I ain't never done anything to you.' He protested, 'They just set us up...you know I love you, Waylon."...he could drive me crazy, but there was something about David that pulled at my heartstrings.<ref name=jenni/>}}

Throughout the rest of the decade, Coe released a string of strong recordings, some of which, such as ''Human Emotions'' (1978) and ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' (1979), were concept albums with each side of the discs given their own theme. 1978's ''[[Family Album (David Allan Coe album)|Family Album]]'' contains Coe's rendition of "Take This Job and Shove It", a song he composed and which had been released by [[Johnny Paycheck]] in October 1977, becoming a monumental success. The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward, and it struck a chord with the public, even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name. Although Coe's name was credited, the assumption by many was that Paycheck, an acclaimed songwriter himself, composed the tune; this would feed into Coe's growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity. Coe was further disenchanted when pop star [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused him of plagiarising his hit "[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]" for Coe's "Divers Do It Deeper". (Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his music, as is evident on his 1979 album ''[[Compass Point (David Allan Coe album)|Compass Point]]''.) By 1980, Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] set out to reach a wider audience and bring Coe back to the charts by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become ''I've Got Something to Say'', which would boast contributions from [[Guy Clark]], [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], [[Dickey Betts]] (from [[The Allman Brothers Band]]), [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Larry Jon Wilson]], and [[George Jones]]. This process was continued the following year on ''Invictus (Means) Unconquered'', with Sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coe's voice. (In his [[AllMusic]] review, Thom Jurek labelled it 'arguably the finest album of his career')<ref name="Allmusic" />

By 1981, the [[outlaw country]] movement waned as the slicker 'urban cowboy' era took hold in country music, typified by the [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]] hit "Lookin' for Love", which critic Kurt Wolff panned as an example of 'watered-down cowboy music'.<ref>Wolff, Kurt, "Country Music: The Rough Guide," Rough Guides Ltd., London; Penguin Putnam, New York, distributor. p. 424 ({{ISBN|1-85828-534-8}})</ref> Coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre, but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period, he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase. Refusing to give into the flavor-of-the-month generic country 'talent', Coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edges.<ref name="Allmusic" /> However, while scoring some moderate hits, mainstream success remained elusive. Coe's highest- charting single during this period was "Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands", a duet with Bill Anderson, which peaked at No. 45. As if aware of the compromises he had been making, Coe chose to close out his 1982 album ''[[D.A.C.]]'' with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologue:

{{blockquote|Makin' records is, uh, somethin' that's kind of hard for me to do because I'm an entertainer. So I made my mind up a few albums ago that I was gonna do so many songs for the record company and so many for myself...we've turned the lights down low in the studio and the musicians have thrown away their little cheat sheets. So this is for all you David Allan Coe fans that's been with me for a long time who  didn't really care if I got played on the radio or not.}}

=== Commercial success (1983–1989) ===
''[[Castles in the Sand]]'' would be a huge comeback for Coe, peaking at No. 8 on the country albums chart, his highest showing since ''[[Once Upon a Rhyme]]'' hit the same mark eight years earlier. Its success was spurred on by "The Ride", which was released in February 1983 as the lead single from the album and reached No. 1 on the June 4 ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' Country Singles Chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/80s_files/19830604C.html|title=Cash Box Country Singles 6/04/83|website=Cashboxmagazine.com|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref> It spent 19 weeks on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, reaching a peak of No. 4 and hitting No. 2 on the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart. The [[ballad (music)|ballad]] tells the first-person story of a hitchhiker's encounter with the ghost of [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams, Sr.]] in a ride from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="billboard">''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', March 19, 1983</ref> The mysterious driver, 'dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed', questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the [[country music]] industry. The song's lyrics place the events on [[U.S. Route 31]] or the largely parallel [[Interstate 65]]. Buoyed by the single, ''[[Castles in the Sand]]'' became the mainstream breakthrough that Coe and producer [[Billy Sherrill]] had been trying for since the decade began. 1984's ''Just Divorced'' contains Coe's second biggest chart hit, "[[Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile]]", which rose to No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country singles chart and No. 3 on ''Cashbox''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20181012224141/http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c.htm] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> In Canada, it reached No. 1 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts dated for June 30, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6782&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=5k2habs6oq2oo3qhbu41reev74 |title=RPM Country Tracks for June 30, 1984 |work=RPM |access-date=8 October 2010}}</ref>  The song is a mid-tempo ballad about a young blonde girl, featuring allusions to the [[Mona Lisa|iconic Da Vinci painting]]. The song features one of producer [[Billy Sherrill]]'s most elaborate productions, with one critic commenting, 'The layered strings and organ work are slick, but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to Coe's voice that it works to devastating effect.'<ref name="Allmusic" />  Another track, "Missin' the Kid", finds a father lamenting the loss of his daughter, who now lives with his estranged ex-wife.  Over a languid beat and using simple language, Coe delivers a stunning vocal that expresses with weary resignation the bitterness, guilt, and extreme sadness that comes with a broken family. Beginning with the line, "I still can't believe after all of these years I still miss you,' the narrator wonders what his wife will tell their daughter when she asks about him, and finally declares:

:I tell myself that it's best if I don't try to see her
:Seeing her now could not make up for all she's been through
:Watching two people she once called her mother and father
:Acting like strangers, that's something I just could not do

In his [[AllMusic]] review of the album, writer Thom Jurek writes:

{{blockquote|"Missin' the Kid" is a self-penned waltz that is sad and haunted, full of regret and remorse over the loss of his daughter when his second marriage broke up, something he never got over. It's also one of the most sensitive things he's ever written, as it is full of empathy for a daughter he hasn't seen in over ten years.<ref name="Allmusic" />}}

"[[She Used to Love Me a Lot]]", was released in December 1984 and peaked at No.  11 on both the US ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart and the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart. (A version of the song by [[Johnny Cash]] was recorded in the early 1980s, but remained unreleased until 2014.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/johnny-cashs-lost-love-song-20140113|title=Johnny Cash's Lost Love Song|publisher=Rolling Stone|last=Sullivan|first=James|access-date=2014-02-13|archive-date=May 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519020628/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/johnny-cashs-lost-love-song-20140113|url-status=dead}}</ref> The song tells of a chance meeting between two ex-lovers at 'the Silver Spoon Café', but when the man tries to rekindle the romance, she dismisses him in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier. It was written by [[Dennis Morgan (songwriter)|Dennis Morgan]], Charles Quillen, and [[Kye Fleming]], as Coe - who continued to write songs of high quality - nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts. The 1986 album ''[[Son of the South (David Allan Coe album)|Son of the South]]'' would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends Nelson, Jennings, and [[Jessi Colter]]. His final recording for Columbia, the concept album ''A Matter of Life…and Death'', was released in 1987.

=== Later career (1990–present) ===
[[File:David Allan Coe (5454565631).jpg|thumb|Coe performing in [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]] in 2011]]

In 1990, Coe reissued his independent albums ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' on compact disc, as well as the compilation ''18 X-Rated Hits''.<ref name=Netherland/> Throughout the 1990s, Coe had a successful career as a concert performer in the United States and Europe.<ref name=Brennan/> In 1999, Coe met [[Pantera]] guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and the two musicians, struck by the similarity of the approaches between country and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], agreed to work together, and began production on an album.<ref name=Leroy/><ref name=Legett/>  In 2000, Coe toured as the opening act for [[Kid Rock]], and ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article by journalist [[Neil Strauss]], who described the material on ''Nothing Sacred'' and ''Underground Album'' as "among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic, and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter".<ref name=Strauss>{{cite news |title=Songwriter's Racist Songs From 1980's Haunt Him |author=Neil Strauss |date=September 4, 2000 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/04/arts/songwriter-s-racist-songs-from-1980-s-haunt-him.html |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>  Coe maintains that he wrote to Strauss during the writing of the article, but the journalist did not acknowledge any interaction between the two, only stating that Coe's manager refused to speak on the record.<ref name=Netherland/><ref name=Strauss/>

In 2003, Coe wrote a song for Kid Rock, "Single Father", which appeared on Kid Rock's [[Kid Rock (album)|self-titled album]], and was released as a single, which peaked at number 50 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard charts|Country Singles chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kid Rock – ''Kid Rock'' – ''Billboard'' Singles |date=October 5, 2011 |website=AllMusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/kid-rock-r663144/charts-awards/billboard-single}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Are ya ready for some country?

In the 2006 video "[[God's Gonna Cut You Down]]", Coe introduces Johnny Cash as the Man in Black. The video, directed by [[Tony Kaye (director)|Tony Kaye]], was released in connection with Cash's cover of the song in ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]''.

In 2017, he was featured singing "Take This Job" on the album ''Baptized in Bourbon'' by the [[Moonshine Bandits]]. He also sings in the video.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lisa |last=Konicki |date=March 8, 2017 |title=David Allan Coe Returns to "Shawshank" Prison to Film Video for "Take This Job" with Moonshine Bandits" |newspaper=NashCountry Daily |url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2017/03/08/david-allan-coe-returns-to-shawshank-prison-to-film-video-for-take-this-job-with-moonshine-bandits/}}</ref>

=== Outlaw origins ===

Coe's integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he had spent time on [[death row]] for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials – but never murder.<ref name=streiss/> Criticisms such as these notwithstanding, Coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name, stating in 2003:

{{blockquote|…the truth is that Waylon and Willie Nelson and I played at an outdoor festival called "48 Hours in Atoka", in Oklahoma...when we got there...several women were raped and people stabbed! There was a lot of alcohol and drugs or whatever. I told my band, 'Don't worry about it. We'll provide our own protection.' At that time, I was in the [[Outlaws Motorcycle Club]]. I had my Outlaws' [[Colors (motorcycling)|colors]] on, I had my pistol in my pocket, and I rode my motorcycle up on stage while Waylon was singing. I got off my motorcycle and went out and started singing with Waylon. And then Willie came out and sang with us. There was a picture of us in the paper that had an arrow pointing to the pistol in my pocket, and another arrow pointing to where it said, 'Outlaws, Florida.' The headline said, 'The Outlaws came to town.' That's actually how it all started.<ref  name="review-mag"/>}} Coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language, even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows. For example, "The House We've Been Calling Home", from the 1977 album ''Rides Again'', explores the theme of polygamy ('me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we've been calling a home...'), while on the final cut on the album, "If That Ain't Country (I'll Kiss Your Ass)", Coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time, singing the line 'workin' like a nigger for my room and board'. The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature, with the narrator describing his tattooed father as 'veteran proud' and deeming his oldest sister 'a first-rate whore'. The song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream and kick-started accusations that he was a racist, a charge he always vehemently denied. In 2004 he remarked:

{{blockquote|I am a songwriter, you know, and to me it has always bothered me that actors in the movies can say whatever they want to say, kill people, rape people and do things and no one ever  accuses them personally of being that way. But when you write a song and then all of a sudden you are being accused of something. To me, songwriting is painting a picture and all you have to work with is words...I grew up with all my life hearing, 'lazy as a Mexican', 'stingy as a Jew', 'working like a nigger', or 'dumb as a Polack'. It's stereotype stuff that you hear growing up that immediately puts a picture in your head.<ref name="swampland"/>}}

The cover of the 1986 release ''Son of the South'', which displayed Coe holding a baby with a [[Confederate flag]] draped over his shoulders, galled many industry insiders, although Coe did print a message on the back of the album to defuse any potential backlash:

{{blockquote|I was born in [[Akron]], Ohio, and I moved to the South when I was in my early twenties, which made me a '[[yankee]]' rebel son. I am not against anything or any place or any nationalities. Regardless of what you've heard about me, there are two things I am very proud of. One of them is my son Tyler, who is my first born son. And the other is my personal relationship with God. I am proud of that relationship as I am proud that my son was conceived in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] and he is truly a son of the south.}}

In another interview, Coe said, "Anyone that would look at me and say I was a racist, would have to be out of their mind. I have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braids...I was in prison with 87% black people, I hung around with black people, and I learned to sing music with black people. It was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a 'nigger lover' and now I write the word 'nigger' in a song and I am all of a sudden a racist. It is pretty ironic."<ref name="swampland"/>

=== Underground albums ===

While Coe lived in Key West, [[Shel Silverstein]] played his comedy album ''[[Freakin' at the Freakers Ball]]'' for Coe, spurring him to perform his own comedic songs for Silverstein, who encouraged Coe to record them, leading to the production of the independently released ''[[Nothing Sacred (David Allan Coe album)|Nothing Sacred]]''.<ref name=Netherland /> [[Jimmy Buffett]] accused Coe of plagiarizing the melody of "Divers Do It Deeper" from Buffett's "[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes (song)|Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]", stating, "I would have sued him, but I didn't want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper."<ref name=Eng>{{cite book |author=Steve Eng |title=Jimmy Buffett: The Man from Margaritaville Revealed |isbn=0-312-16875-6 |page=217 |chapter=Hello, Textas—Hello, St. Barts (and Montserrat) |date=October 15, 1997 |publisher=Macmillan }}</ref> In response to the success of Buffett's song, Coe wrote a song insulting Buffett, and it appeared on ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng /> The album was released by mail order in 1978, through the back pages of the biker magazine ''[[Easyriders]]''.<ref name=Netherland>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=360 |title=David Allan Coe rebuts racism charge |author=Tom Netherland |date=November 2000 |publisher=Country Standard Time |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

Coe's 1979 Columbia album ''[[Spectrum VII]]'' contained a note stating "[[Jimmy Buffett]] does not live in [[Key West]] anymore", a lyric from a song from ''Nothing Sacred''.<ref name=Eng /> The album's songs are profane, often sexually explicit, and describe an orgy in Nashville's [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]] and sex with [[pornographic film]] star [[Linda Lovelace]]. The album also contains a song targeting [[Anita Bryant]], a musician notable for her strong [[LGBT rights opposition|opposition to LGBT rights]], specifically her fight to repeal an LGBT [[anti-discrimination]] ordinance in [[Miami-Dade County]]. In the song, bluntly titled "Fuck Aneta Briant" {{sic}}, Coe calls out Bryant as being hypocritical for her opposition to the lifestyles of gay people, stating that "In fact Anita Bryant, some act just like you".<ref name=Eng/><ref name=Washburne>{{cite book |others=Christopher Washburne, Maiken Derno |title=Bad music: the music we love to hate |isbn=0-415-94366-3 |page=37 |chapter=White trash alchemies of the abject sublime |year=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press }}</ref>

In 1982, Coe released another independent album, ''[[Underground Album]]'', which contained his most controversial song, "Nigger Fucker". Written from the perspective of a man whose lover left him for an African American man, the sexually explicit song resulted in Coe being accused of racism.<ref name=Washburne /><ref>{{cite book |title=Dixie Lullaby: A Story of Music, Race, and New Beginnings in a New South |author=Mark Kemp|year=2006|isbn=0-8203-2872-3 |page=204 |publisher=University of Georgia Press }}</ref> Primarily because of this song, the material recorded by singer and [[white supremacist]] [[Johnny Rebel (singer)|Johnny Rebel]] has also been mistakenly attributed to Coe.  [[AllMusic]], which did not review ''Underground Album'', gave it three out of five stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/underground-album-mw0000984101/user-reviews|title=Underground Album - David Allan Coe {{!}} User Reviews|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Coe responded to the accusations by saying "Anyone that hears this album and says I'm a racist, is full of shit."<ref name=Leroy /> Coe's drummer, Kerry Brown, is black and married to a white woman. Brown is the son of legendary blues musician [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]. When asked about Coe's X-rated albums, Brown stated "David Allan Coe was controversial. Some of the songs are really out there. But it's my life. When you live in the David Allan Coe world, you learn to be controversial."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meet the Collective: Kerry Brown|url=https://salon726.com/home/meet-the-collective-kerry-brown|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Preservation Hall Blog|date=October 26, 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Bankruptcy ===

Like Willie Nelson and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], Coe has battled the [[IRS]] costing him the publishing rights to his compositions, including "Take This Job and Shove It". He stated in 2003:

{{blockquote|All of my songs up to 1984 were sold in a bankruptcy proceeding for, like, $25,000 from the bankruptcy court, because nobody told me they'd been put up for sale! Basically the IRS claimed I owed them $100,000. I was living at a place and we had a flood and everything was destroyed. They knew I didn't have any records – any proof of what I did have and what I didn't have. So I just filed [for] bankruptcy. [Willie] Nelson chose to deal with them. I chose not to. I'm totally straight with them now. The only income I have is the money I make on the road performing and from my new songs that I own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.review-mag.com/|title= An Exclusive Interview with David Allan Coe|last=Engelhardt|first=Kristof|date=January 2003|work=Review|access-date=January 14, 2020}}</ref>}}

In another interview, Coe added, "All the songs on the X-rated albums were sold. I don't own that stuff anymore. I have nothing to do with that stuff. They have to give me credit as the songwriter, but I don't make one cent."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/|title= David Allan Coe rebuts racism charge|last=netherland|first=Tom|date=November 2000|work=Country Standard Time|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref>

==Musical style==

Coe's musical style derives from [[blues]], rock, and [[country music]] traditions.<ref name=Brennan /><ref name=Ruhlmann>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/recommended-for-airplay-r400746/review |title=Recommended for Airplay – David Allan Coe |author=William Ruhlmann |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref> His vocal style is described as a 'throaty [[baritone]]'.<ref name=Ruhlmann /> His lyrical content is often humorous or comedic, with William Ruhlmann describing him as a 'near-parody of a country singer'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/album/super-hits-vol-2-r235027/review |title=''Super Hits, Vol. 2'' |author=William Ruhlmann |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] describes Coe as "a great, unashamed country singer, singing the purest [[honky-tonk]] and hardest country of his era […] he may not be the most original [[Outlaw country|outlaw]], but there is none more outlaw than him".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/for-the-record-the-first-10-years-r92049/review |title=For the Record: The First 10 Years |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

They had a little more to say than just, 'Oh baby I miss you', or whatever. I don't do anything halfway. Once I got into country music, I went back and researched it, and learned everything there was to know about it. I could do impersonations of [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Marty Robbins]], just about anybody. I knew just about all there was to know about country music."<ref name="review-mag"/>

Coe's first country album, ''[[The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy]]'', has been described as [[alternative country|alt-country]], '[[Protopunk|pre-punk]]' and "a [[hillbilly]] version of [[Marc Bolan]]'s glitz and glitter".<ref name=Allmusic /> Credited influences on the album include [[Merle Haggard]].<ref name="Allmusic" /> In his early career, Coe was known for his unpredictable live performances, in which he would ride a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle onto the stage and curse at his audience.<ref name=Brennan /> Coe has also performed in a rhinestone suit and a mask which resembled that of [[the Lone Ranger]], calling himself the 'Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy'.<ref name=Brennan />

Despite accusations of racism for the content of some of his song lyrics, Coe's [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[concept album]] ''[[Requiem for a Harlequin]]'' (1970), saw Coe "honoring the birth of [[soul music]], ranting against the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]], and commiserating with other children of the 'concrete jungle'" in what ''Phoenix New Times'' described as "Coe's [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] audition tape" and a "stab at [[radical chic]]",<ref>{{cite web |title=David Allan Coe Versus Insane Clown Posse |url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/david-allan-coe-versus-insane-clown-posse-6430907 |first=Craig |last=Outhier |work=Phoenix New Times |access-date=2023-06-30}}</ref> and his later album ''[[Rebel Meets Rebel]]'' featured a song, "Cherokee Cry", which criticizes the United States government's treatment of Native Americans.<ref name=Frye /> When asked why he did not write more political songs, Coe replied, "I live in my own world, not ''thee'' world. I just write songs about what affects me in everyday life. At one point I wrote a song that was sort of a protest about when they were talking about drafting women into the military. It was about my son making it past the draft, but my daughter didn't. And I've done Farm Aid."<ref name="review-mag"/>

In his review of Coe's 1987 album ''A Matter of Life...and Death'', Allmusic's Thom Jurek wrote, "Coe may have had some hits, but it is records like this that make one wonder if there was not a conspiracy to marginalize him and make him fail. Coe is a brilliant songwriter well into the 21st century, and deserves to be lauded along with the likes of [Willie] Nelson and [Waylon] Jennings and Kristofferson and Newbury – and even Cash."<ref name=Allmusic/>

'''DeFord Bailey Sr.'''<ref name="story"/> (December 14, 1899 – July 2, 1982)<ref name="Wolfe"/> was an American singer-songwriter and musician, who was considered the first African American [[country music]] and [[blues]] star. He started his career in the 1920s and was one of the first performers to be introduced on Nashville radio station [[WSM (AM)|WSM]]'s [[Grand Ole Opry]], and becoming alongside [[Uncle Dave Macon]] one of the programs most famous performers.<ref name="Quote">{{cite web|url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/deford-bailey|title=Deford Bailey|publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame|access-date=December 10, 2021|quote=In 1927, Hay spontaneously renamed the Barn Dance while introducing some of his down-home musicians on a WSM weekday evening broadcast following a classical music program. Countering the view that “there is no place in the classics for realism,” Hay said, “[W]e will present nothing but realism. It will be down to earth for the ‘earthy.’” As if to illustrate his point, Hay introduced Bailey, whose “Pan American Blues” recreated the whoosh of the L&N Railroad express train he had heard from his boyhood. In his introduction, Hay also said, “For the past hour, we have been listening to music largely from Grand Opera, but from now on, we will present ‘The Grand Ole Opry.’” Thus Bailey and his musical cohorts helped to inspire the name of America’s longest-running radio show.}}</ref> He was the first African-American performer to appear on the show, and the first performer to record his music in Nashville.<ref name=Tennessean/> Bailey played several instruments in his career but is best known for playing the [[harmonica]], often being referred to as a "harmonica wizard".

Bailey was born and raised in Tennessee, all his family played "black hillbilly" country and blue's music and he learned how to play the harmonica and mandolin while recuperating from polio as a young child.<ref name=Tennessean/>. He moved from New York to Nashville with relatives in his late teens and was a significant early contributor to Nashville's burgeoning music industry. Among the first generation of entertainers to perform live on the radio, his recorded compositions were well-known and popular.

Bailey toured and performed with [[Roy Acuff]] and many well-known country artists during the 1930s. But as a result of the 1941 royalties disagreement between [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] (BMI) and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), he was fired by WSM and stopped making his living as an entertainer. Afterwards, he supported himself and his family by opening a shoe shining company and renting out rooms in his home. He returned to sporadic public performances in 1974 when he was invited to participate in the Opry's first Old-Timers show and in 2005 was posthumously inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

His back remained slightly misshapen and he only grew to be 4 feet, 10 inches. He was so short and slender as a teenager he was mistaken to be an underage child by railroad ticket agents.{{sfn|Morton|Wolfe|1993|pp=16, 32, 39}} His foster father Clark Odom was hired as a manager for a farm near Nashville and in 1908 the family made the move from Smith County.{{sfn|Morton|Wolfe|1993|pp=22–23}} The Odoms and their foster son lived on Nashville and Franklin Tennessee farms Clark Odom managed for several years.

==Influence and posthumous accolades==
Bailey himself said that he came from a tradition of "black hillbilly music".<ref name = "Country Music Hall of Fame"/> His family members had played a variety of instruments, including a grandfather who had been a well-known local fiddler in Smith County, Tennessee. He said later when referring to playing the harmonica when he was growing up "Oh, I wore it out trying to imitate everything I hear! Hens, foxes, hounds, turkeys, and all those trains and things on the road. Everything around me."

'''Forrest Richard Betts''' (December 12, 1943 – April 18, 2024) was an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, composer and founding member of [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. He initially shared the band's signature dual [[lead guitar]] roles with band founder [[Duane Allman]], and assumed the solo lead after Allman's death in October of 1971.  As both a singer and composer as well, he was central to the group's greatest commercial success in the mid-1970s and was the writer and vocalist on the Allmans' hit single "[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]". 

Early in his career Betts was best noted for collaboration with Duane Allman,<ref name=Tdrozodowski>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|title=Come and Go Blues: The Incredible Guitarists of the Allman Brothers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126202416/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|archive-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> the twosome introducing melodic twin guitar harmony and counterpoint, which, according to ''Guitar World'' "rewrote the rules for how two rock guitarists can work together, completely scrapping the traditional rhythm/lead roles to stand toe to toe".<ref name="GW July 2009">{{cite magazine|title=The Allman Brothers Band: The Road Goes on Forever|magazine=Guitar World|date=July 20, 2009|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202053024/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|archive-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref> Betts initially gained renown for his epic [[instrumental]], "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]", from the Band's second album, ''[[Idlewild South]]'', followed by his striking guitar duet-driven "[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]", which not only was his first band vocal but signaled a dramatic new sound and potential direction for it.  

In the wake of Duane's death the group indeed followed both Betts' musical direction and band leadership, exploding into commercial success in 1973 upon the introduction of the [[Country music|Country]]-influenced ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', and the chart success of its catchy Betts-written hits, exuberant "Ramblin' Man" and the melodic instrumental "[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]".

The band went through a hiatus in the late 1970s, during which time Betts, like many of the other band members, pursued a solo career and side projects under such names as Great Southern and The Dickey Betts Band.  The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979, with [[Dan Toler]] taking the second guitar role alongside Betts.  In 1982, it broke up a second time, during which break Betts formed the group [[Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks]], which lasted until 1984.  A third reformation occurred in 1989, with [[Warren Haynes]] then joining Betts on guitar. 

Betts was ousted from the band in 2000 over a conflict regarding his continued drug and alcohol abuse; he never played with them again, nor would he appear with other former band members for reunions or side projects. With the death of Betts on April 18, 2024, Jai Johanny "[[Jaimoe]]" Johanson is the last living founding member of the Allman Brothers Band.

He was inducted with the band into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-allman-brothers-band/ |title=The Allman Brothers Band: inducted in 1995 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=February 28, 2012 |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701000000/http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-allman-brothers-band/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and also won a best rock performance [[Grammy Award]] with the band for "Jessica" in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1995&genre=All|title=1995 Grammy Award Winners|publisher=Grammy.com|access-date=November 18, 2012|archive-date=September 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923073524/http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1995&genre=All|url-status=live}}</ref> Betts was ranked No. 58 on ''Rolling Stone''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list in 2003, and No. 61 on the list published in 2011.<ref name=RS931>{{cite magazine |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=931 |date=September 22, 2003 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/dickey-betts-19691231 |access-date=August 26, 2017 |archive-date=July 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713073551/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/dickey-betts-19691231 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=RS1145>{{cite magazine|title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time|magazine=Rolling Stone|issue=1145|date=November 23, 2011|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/dickey-betts-19691231|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-date=July 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718093137/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/dickey-betts-19691231|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Early life ==
{{expand section|date=September 2024}}

Betts was born in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], on December 12, 1943, and raised in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcwXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT69|title=Skydog: The Duane Allman Story|first=Randy|last=Poe|date=August 1, 2008|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781617134876}}</ref><ref name=NFMHOF>{{cite web|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Michael|title=Betts, Dickey|url=http://nfmhof.com/2008/08/13/betts-dickey|publisher=North Florida Music Hall of Fame|access-date=August 3, 2014|date=August 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108154840/http://nfmhof.com/2008/08/13/betts-dickey|archive-date=November 8, 2014}}</ref> He grew up in a musical family listening to [[traditional bluegrass]], [[country music]] and [[Western swing]]. He started playing ukulele at the age of five and, as his hands got bigger, moved on to mandolin, banjo, and guitar.

==Career==
By the age of sixteen Betts was feeling the need for something "a little faster", and played in a series of rock bands on the Florida circuit, up the East Coast and into the Midwest.  In 1967 he formed the Second Coming in Florida with [[Berry Oakley]]. According to its composer, [[Rick Derringer]], the group called the Jokers referenced in "[[Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo]]" was one of Betts' early groups of that name.<ref>Scott Freeman, ''Midnight Riders'', pp. 41–42</ref>

=== Early Allman Brothers Band years ===
In 1969, [[Duane Allman]], a veteran of the South's "Chitlin' Circuit" of roadhouses and small local venues who'd gone on to form several bands with recording contracts, was casting for talent to build another around.  A successful session player, he'd gained a deal with [[Southern soul]] impresario [[Phil Walden]], who planned to back a [[power trio]] featuring Allman. The ensuing Allman Brothers Band eventually grew to six members, including Duane's brother, organist, vocalist, and composer [[Gregg Allman|Gregg]], Betts, and bassist [[Berry Oakley]].{{cn|date=April 2024}} Duane, who later worked with famed British guitar virtuoso [[Eric Clapton]], earning notoriety for his standout playing on "[[Layla (song)|Layla]]'', the collaboration's signature hit, once said with typical modesty, "I'm the famous guitar player, but Dickey is the good one."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Alex |title=Dickey Betts, Fiery Guitarist With Allman Brothers Band, Dies at 80 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/arts/music/dickey-betts-dead.html |work=The New York Times |date=April 18, 2024 |access-date=April 20, 2024 |archive-date=April 19, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240419202131/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/arts/music/dickey-betts-dead.html |url-status=live }}</ref> 

After Allman's death in October 1971, Betts became the band's sole lead guitarist (with a pianist bringing the group back up to six members) and took on a greater singing, composing, and leadership role. Rushed into the role, he practiced [[slide guitar]] intensively in order to be able to cover the majority of Duane's parts. He wrote "[[Jessica (Allman Brothers Band song)|Jessica]]", inspired by his young daughter Jessica,<ref>{{Cite book|title=One Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band|first=Alan|last=Paul|year=2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1250040497}}</ref>and the Allmans' biggest commercial hit, "[[Ramblin' Man (Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]",<ref>{{cite web|url= https://rockcellarmagazine.com/dickey-betts-dies-allman-brothers-band-obituary/|title=Dickey Betts, Allman Brothers Co-Founder Who Wrote "Ramblin' Man," "Jessica" and More, Dies at 80|publisher=Rockcellarmagazine.com|date=April 18, 2024|accessdate=April 20, 2024}}</ref> for the Band's breakout commercial success, ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', in 1974.

=== Solo career and later work ===
[[File:Dickey Betts (1974).jpg|thumb|Betts in 1974|244x244px]]
Betts's first solo album, ''[[Highway Call]]'', was released in 1974 and featured fiddle player [[Vassar Clements]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Highway Call – Dickey Betts, Richard Betts &#124; Album &#124; AllMus |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/highway-call-mw0000199122 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221022115912/https://www.allmusic.com/album/highway-call-mw0000199122 |archive-date=October 22, 2022 |access-date=April 19, 2024 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> After the Allman Brothers fell apart in 1976, Betts released more albums, starting with ''[[Dickey Betts & Great Southern (album)|Dickey Betts & Great Southern]]'' in 1977, which included the song "Bougainvillea", co-written with future Hollywood star and then Florida transplant [[Don Johnson]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dickey Betts & Great Southern – Dickey Betts & Great Southe |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dickey-betts-great-southern-mw0000602906 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230909051526/https://www.allmusic.com/album/dickey-betts-great-southern-mw0000602906 |archive-date=September 9, 2023 |access-date=April 19, 2024 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> In 1978 he released an album, ''[[Atlanta's Burning Down]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Atlanta's Burning Down – Dickey Betts &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/atlantas-burning-down-mw0000049199 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221020100419/https://www.allmusic.com/album/atlantas-burning-down-mw0000049199 |archive-date=October 20, 2022 |access-date=April 19, 2024 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979 for the album ''[[Enlightened Rogues]]'', with two members of Great Southern replacing Allman Brothers members who were unwilling to participate in the reunion: guitar player [[Dan Toler]] for pianist [[Chuck Leavell]], and bassist [[David Goldflies]] for bassist [[Lamar Williams]]. Several albums and personnel changes followed, until declining record and concert ticket sales, personnel issues, and management problems led the group to disband again in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 27, 2014 |title=History of the Allman Brothers Band |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allman-brothers-band-history/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231003172943/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allman-brothers-band-history/ |archive-date=October 3, 2023 |access-date=April 20, 2024 |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com}}</ref>

Betts formed his own band, [[Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks]], where he was co-frontman along with former [[Wet Willie]] singer, saxophone, and harmonica player [[Jimmy Hall]]. Despite earning good notices, the group was unable to secure a recording contract and disbanded in 1984.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Leavell |first1=Chuck |title=Between Rock And A Home Place |last2=Craig |first2=J.

The success of the one-off tour resulted in a permanent reunion, which absorbed Betts's energies for the remainder of the 1990s.

Betts was replaced on numerous Allman Brothers tour dates throughout the mid-to-late 1990s, for what were reported in the media as "personal reasons". While remaining active as a touring band, the Allman Brothers did not release another album of studio material after 1994's ''[[Where It All Begins]]'' for nine years, until ''[[Hittin' the Note]]'' in 2003. In 1994, Haynes and Allmans bassist Allen Woody formed [[Gov't Mule]] with former Dickey Betts Band drummer Matt Abts as a side project, and left the Allman Brothers for Gov't Mule full-time in 1997. Betts' last show with the Allman Brothers was at the Music Midtown Festival in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], on May 7, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roger Catlin |date=May 25, 2000 |title=BETTS IS ANGRY AS ALLMANS DUMP HIM FROM TOUR |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2000-05-25-0005251999-story.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720154255/https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2000-05-25-0005251999-story.html |archive-date=July 20, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2021 |website=Courant.com}}</ref>

A breaking point was reached after that show and before the launch of the band's Summer Campaign Tour when the remaining original Allman Brothers members – Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks, and Jaimoe – suspended Betts.<ref name="ew">{{Cite magazine |last=Reese |first=Lori |date=May 18, 2000 |title=Brothers in Law |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85221,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021145418/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85221,00.html |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |access-date=June 16, 2011 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> According to Betts, the band told him (reportedly via [[fax]]) to "get clean" (from alcohol and/or drugs). 

He was temporarily replaced for the 2000 tour by [[Jimmy Herring]], formerly of the [[Aquarium Rescue Unit]]. When Betts filed suit against the other three original Allmans, the separation turned into a permanent divorce.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allman |first=Gregg |title=My Cross To Bear |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2012}}{{p.|340}}</ref> Betts re-formed the Dickey Betts Band and toured that same summer. The band reassumed the name Dickey Betts & Great Southern and added Betts' son Duane (named after Duane Allman) on lead guitar. In 2005, Betts released the DVD ''Live from the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Back Where It All Begins: Live at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [Video] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/back-where-it-all-begins-live-at-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-video--mw0001020587 |access-date=April 20, 2024 |publisher=AllMusic}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Watson was born in [[Deep Gap, North Carolina]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1235/6}}</ref>  According to Watson on his three-CD biographical recording ''[[Legacy (Doc Watson album)|Legacy]]'', he got the nickname "Doc" during a live radio broadcast when the announcer remarked that his given name Arthel was odd and he needed an easy nickname. A fan in the crowd shouted "Call him Doc!", presumably in reference to the literary character [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s companion, [[Doctor Watson]].  The name stuck.<ref name="Legacy">
{{cite video

An eye infection caused Watson to lose his vision before his second birthday.<ref name="Larkin"/> He attended North Carolina's school for the blind, the [[Governor Morehead School]], in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].<ref name="Kaufman">{{cite book| last = Kaufman| first = Steve| title = The Legacy of Doc Watson| publisher = Mel Bay Publications| year = 1999| page = 152| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Et6zwlhPwUcC | isbn = 978-0-7866-3393-7}}</ref>

In a 1989 radio interview with [[Terry Gross]] on the ''[[Fresh Air]]'' show on [[National Public Radio]], Watson spoke about how he got his first guitar. His father told him if he and his brother David chopped down all the small dead [[chestnut tree]]s along the edge of their field, they could sell the wood to a [[tannery]].  Watson bought a Sears Silvertone from [[Sears Roebuck]] with his earnings,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://equipboard.com/pros/doc-watson/sears-silvertone-1448l-model-57|work=equipboard.com|title=The Guitar of Doc Watson}}</ref> while his brother bought a new suit.<ref name="firstguitar">

Martin & Company|Martin]] D-18.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fretbase.com/blog/2010/9/doc-watsons-first-martin-guitar/ |title=Fretbase, Doc Watson's first Martin Guitar |publisher=Fretbase.com |date=September 9, 2010 |access-date=2012-05-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307230958/http://www.fretbase.com/blog/2010/9/doc-watsons-first-martin-guitar/ |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Watson's earliest influences were country roots musicians and groups such as the [[Carter Family]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. The first song he learned to play on the guitar was "When Roses Bloom in Dixieland", first recorded by the [[Carter Family]] in 1930. Watson said in an interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'' that "[[Jimmie Rodgers]] was the first man that I started to claim as my favorite."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/r-i-p-doc-watson-read-our-2012-interview/|title=R.I.P. Doc Watson; Read Our 2012 Interview|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=May 30, 2012}}</ref>  Watson proved to be a natural musical talent and within months was performing on local street corners playing songs from the [[Delmore Brothers]], [[Louvin Brothers]], and [[Bill Monroe|Monroe Brothers]] alongside his brother Linny. By the time Watson reached adulthood, he had become a proficient acoustic and electric guitar player.<ref name="misterguitar">{{cite web|url=http://www.misterguitar.com/bios/watsonbio.html|title=Doc Watson|publisher=Chet Atkins: Mister Guitar – Books & Bios|work=misterguitar.com/bios|access-date=2008-11-28}}</ref>

===Career===
[[File:Doc Watson 1994-4.jpg|thumb|Watson performing in 1994]]

In 1953, Watson joined the [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]–based Jack Williams's [[country and western]] [[Swing music|swing]] band on [[electric guitar]]. The band seldom had a [[fiddle]] player, but was often asked to play at [[square dance]]s. Following the example of country guitarists [[Grady Martin]] and [[Hank Garland]], Watson taught himself to play fiddle tunes on his [[Gibson Les Paul]] electric guitar. He later transferred the technique to acoustic guitar, and playing fiddle tunes became part of his signature sound.<ref name="miller"/><ref name="AG">{{cite web | last = Havighurst | first = Craig | title = Living Legacy | publisher = Acoustic Guitar magazine | date = June 2003 | url = http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag126/feature126.html | access-date = November 20, 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090429095130/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag126/feature126.html | archive-date = April 29, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>  During his time with Jack Williams, Watson also supported his family as a [[piano tuner]].

In 1960, as the [[American folk music revival]] grew, Watson took the advice of folk [[musicologist]] and [[Smithsonian]] [[curator]] [[Ralph Rinzler]] and began playing acoustic guitar and [[banjo]] exclusively.<ref name="Kaufman" /> That move ignited Watson's career when he played on his first recording, ''Old Time Music at [[Clarence Ashley]]'s''.  Also of pivotal importance for his career was his February 11, 1961, appearance at [[P.S. 41]] in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | last = Grimes | first = William | title = Doc Watson, Blind Guitar Wizard Who Influenced Generations, Dies at 89 | newspaper = New York Times  | date = May 29, 2012 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/arts/music/doc-watson-folk-musician-dies-at-89.html | access-date = May 30, 2012}}</ref> He then began to tour as a solo performer and appeared at universities and clubs like the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Watson would eventually get his big break and rave reviews for his performance at the renowned [[Newport Folk Festival]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in 1963.<ref name="Larkin"/>  Watson recorded his first solo album in 1964 and began performing with his son, [[Merle Watson|Merle]] in the same year.<ref name="Larkin"/>

After the folk revival waned during the late 1960s, Doc Watson's career was sustained by his performance of the [[Jimmy Driftwood]] song "[[Tennessee Stud]]" on the 1972 live album recording ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]''.  As popular as ever, Doc and Merle began playing as a trio with [[T. Michael Coleman]] on bass guitar in 1974. The trio toured the globe during the late seventies and early eighties, recording nearly fifteen albums between 1973 and 1985, and bringing Doc and Merle's unique blend of acoustic music to millions of new fans.<ref name="AG"/> In 1985, Merle died in a tractor accident on his family farm. Two years later [[MerleFest|Merle Fest]] was inaugurated in remembrance of him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/86014/interview-docs-orders-no-heavy-metal-merlefest|title=Interview- Doc's orders: No heavy metal at MerleFest|website=Readthehook.com|access-date=2016-05-16|archive-date=May 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530212257/http://www.readthehook.com/86014/interview-docs-orders-no-heavy-metal-merlefest|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:DocW Sculpture Boone.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Watson sculpture on the corner of King and Depot Streets in [[Boone, North Carolina]].

{{quote box|width=22em|[[Arlen Roth]] writes, "...we can attribute an entirely new style and a whole generation of pickers to [Watson's] inspiration.  He was the first rural acoustic player to truly 'amaze' urban audiences in the early 1960s with his dazzling, fast technique, and he has continued to be a driving, creative force on the acoustic music scene."<ref>{{cite book| last=Roth| first=Arlen| title=Arlen Roth's complete acoustic guitar| publisher=Schirmer Books| date=1985| page=47| isbn=0-02-872150-0}}</ref>}}

Doc Watson played guitar in both [[flatpicking]] and [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] style, but is best known for his flatpick work. His guitar playing skills, combined with his authenticity as a mountain musician, made him a highly influential figure during the folk music revival. He pioneered a fast and flashy [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] lead guitar style including fiddle tunes and [[crosspicking]] techniques which were adopted and extended by [[Clarence White]], [[Tony Rice]] and many others. Watson was also an accomplished banjo player and sometimes accompanied himself on harmonica as well. Known also for his distinctive and rich [[baritone]] voice, Watson over the years developed a vast repertoire of mountain [[ballad]]s, which he learned via the [[oral tradition]] of his home area in [[Deep Gap, North Carolina]].

Watson played a [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] model D-18 guitar on his earliest recordings. In 1968, Watson began a relationship with Gallagher Guitars when he started playing their G-50 model. His first Gallagher, which Watson referred to as "Ol' Hoss", was on display at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] before residing at the Gallagher shop until 2012, when it was auctioned through [[Christie's]] on November 27, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Release: Christie's to Offer a Range of Fine Musical Instruments in November from Italian Masters to Contemporary Classics |url=https://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=5934&lid=1&mob-is-app=false |access-date=2022-07-23 |website=www.christies.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1974, Gallagher created a customized G-50 line to meet Watson's preferred specifications, which bears the Doc Watson name. In 1991, Gallagher customized a personal [[Cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]] guitar for Watson that he played until his death and which he referred to as "Donald" in honor of Gallagher guitar's second-generation proprietor and builder, Don Gallagher.<ref name="callow">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallagherguitar.com/flatpickart.html|title=Gallagher Guitars|last=Callow|first=John|date=January 1997|publisher=Flatpicking Guitar Magazine, Vol 1, No 2|work=flatpick.com|access-date=2008-11-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108001406/http://www.gallagherguitar.com/flatpickart.html|archive-date=November 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During his last years, Watson played a [[Dana Bourgeois]] [[Dreadnought (guitar type)|dreadnought]] given to him by [[Ricky Skaggs]] for his 80th birthday. Another of Watson's favorites was his Arnold guitar, "The Jimmie", built by luthier John Arnold as a tribute to the famous 1926 Martin 00-18 played by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].

In 1994, Watson teamed with musicians [[Randy Scruggs]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] to contribute the classic song "[[Keep on the Sunny Side]]" to the AIDS benefit album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

===Later life===
[[File:Merlewatson.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Merle Watson, c. 1979]]

In his later life, Watson scaled back his touring schedule. He was generally joined onstage by his grandson (Merle's son) Richard, as well as longtime musical partners [[David Holt (musician)|David Holt]] or [[Jack Lawrence (bluegrass)|Jack Lawrence]]. On June 19, 2007, Watson was accompanied by Australian guitar player [[Tommy Emmanuel]] at a concert at the [[Bass Performance Hall]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Watson also performed, accompanied by Holt and Richard, at the [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass]] festival in [[San Francisco]] in 2009, as he had done for several previous festivals.

'''Douglas Wayne Sahm''' (November 6, 1941 – November 18, 1999) was an American musician, singer-songwriter and [[multi-instrumentalist]] born in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Sahm is regarded as one of the main figures of [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex music]], and as an important performer of [[Music of Texas|Texan Music]]. He gained fame along with his band, the [[Sir Douglas Quintet]], with a top-twenty hit in the United States and the United Kingdom with "[[She's About a Mover]]" (1965). Sahm was influenced by the San Antonio music scene that included [[conjunto]] and [[blues]], and later by the [[hippie]] scene of [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garcia |first=Camille |date=November 15, 2016 |title=Sir Doug Tells Lesser-known Story of SA's Doug Sahm, the 'Groover's Groover' |url=http://sanantonioreport.org/sir-doug-tells-lesser-known-story-of-sas-doug-sahm-the-groovers-groover/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321210522/https://sanantonioreport.org/sir-doug-tells-lesser-known-story-of-sas-doug-sahm-the-groovers-groover/ |archive-date=March 21, 2023 |access-date=May 23, 2024 |website=San Antonio Report |language=en-US}}</ref> With his blend of music, he found success performing in [[Austin, Texas]], as the hippie counterculture soared in the 1970s.

Sahm began singing at age five and learned to play the steel guitar at age six. He was considered a [[child prodigy]] on the instrument. By the age of eight, he had appeared on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''. He made his recording debut as "Little Doug" in 1955, and was influenced by [[rock and roll]] during his teenage years. Sahm had local hit records, while he played clubs as a musician for other bands. In 1965, [[Huey P. Meaux]] produced Sahm and the Sir Douglas Quintet's "She's About a Mover". The same year, Sahm moved to California. In 1971, he returned to San Antonio, and soon after he moved to Austin. [[Atlantic Records]] signed Sahm and released his debut solo album ''[[Doug Sahm and Band]]'' in 1973.

After a continuing decline in record sales, Sahm kept performing in clubs in Austin, and moved through different record labels. Meanwhile, he enjoyed success in Sweden and in Canada. In 1989, Sahm formed the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Texas Tornados]] with fellow Tex-Mex musicians [[Augie Meyers]], [[Freddy Fender]] and [[Flaco Jiménez]]. The Texas Tornados toured successfully, and one of their releases earned a [[Grammy Award]]. In 1999, Sahm died during a vacation trip. A posthumous album, ''[[The Return of Wayne Douglas]]'', was released in 2000. Sahm received multiple honors in the state of Texas, including hall of fame inductions and memorials in public places.

==Early life and start in music==
Doug Sahm was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], on November&nbsp;6, 1941, to Victor&nbsp;A. Sahm, Sr. and Viva Lee (née Goodman).{{sfn|Jasinski, Laurie|2012|p=1382}} The Sahm family had migrated to the United States from Germany early in the 20th&nbsp;century, and settled initially in [[Galveston, Texas]]. Sahm's grandparents, Alfred and Alga, owned a farm near [[Cibolo, Texas]]. Alfred Sahm was a musician who played with the polka band The Sahm Boys. During the [[Great Depression]], Sahm's parents moved to San Antonio, where Victor worked at [[Kelly Field]] Air Force base.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=3}}

Sahm began singing at age five, and took up the [[steel guitar]] at age six. The same year, he appeared on San Antonio's radio station [[KSLR|KMAC]] and performed the [[Sons of the Pioneers]]' "Teardrops in My Heart".{{sfn|Helander, Brock|2001|p=632}} He was regarded as a [[child prodigy]] on the steel guitar.{{sfn|Powell, Austin|Freeman, Doug|Johnston, Daniel|2011|p=85}}{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=44}}{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|2002|p=382}} His mother took him to a local music school, but his teacher turned him down soon after. His teacher explained he could not teach Sahm to read [[musical notation|music]], and the boy could already [[playing by ear|play by ear]]. Sahm often appeared at a local club, The Barn, which his uncle co-owned with [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]].{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|1971|pp=26, 27}} By the time he was eight, he could play the [[fiddle]] and [[mandolin]], and he began to appear on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' as "Little Doug".{{sfn|Jasinski, Laurie|2012|p=1382}} He also performed shows with [[Hank Williams]], [[Faron Young]] and [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]]. At age thirteen, he was offered a spot on the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' that his mother declined, wanting him to finish school.{{sfn|Jasinski, Laurie|2012|p=1382}} In 1953, Sahm met [[Augie Meyers]] while he purchased [[baseball card]]s at Meyer's mother's grocery store,{{sfn|Magnet staff|2002}} and the two became friends. Meyers and Sahm discussed forming a band, but nothing came of it as both played with different groups. Meyers mastered the [[accordion]], [[piano]] and [[rhythm guitar]].{{sfn|Reid, Jan| Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=10}} Sahm grew up on the East side of San Antonio, a predominantly black neighborhood. He listened from his home to the live performances of [[T-Bone Walker]] and other blues artists who appeared at a nearby blues bar, the Eastwood Country Club.{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|1971|pp=26, 27}} Sahm's neighbor, Homer Callahan, introduced him to the records of [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Lonesome Sundown]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Jimmy Reed]], and [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Excello Records]].{{sfn|Antone's Record Label staff|1995}}

[[File:Doug-Sahm-High-School.jpg|150px|thumb|alt= Photographic portrait of Sahm in his high school years wearing sunglasses|High school portrait of Sahm, circa 1958|left]]
In 1955, producer Charlie Fitch released Sahm's debut single on Sarg Records.{{sfn|Bradley, Andy|Wood, Roger|2010|p=88}} Cataloged with the number 113-45 on the label's releases, the pairing of "A Real American Joe" with "Rollin' Rollin'" was credited to Little Doug.{{sfn|Billboard staff|1955|p=48}} The same year, Sahm formed his first band, The Kings. A year later, one of his concerts in school was interrupted by the principal after Sahm started imitating [[Elvis Presley]]'s gyrations. The students left the auditorium and headed to Sahm's house to continue listening to the band.{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|1971|pp=26, 27}} As he continued performing country music, fiddler J. R. Chatwell, who played with bandleader [[Adolph Hofner]], mentored him. The music of [[Lefty Frizzell]], Howlin' Wolf, Lonesome Sundown, Elvis Presley, [[Little Richard]], T-Bone Walker, [[Floyd Tillman]], and San Antonio musicians Johnny Owen and Ricky Aguirre influenced him during his teenage years.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=421}}{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|1971|pp=26, 27}}

Sahm enjoyed success performing in San Antonio nightclubs,{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=20}} as he played a blend of music that consisted of [[rhythm and blues]] with the addition of the West Side tenor saxophone player Eracleo "Rocky" Morales.{{sfn|Govenar, Alan|1988|p=203}} The "West Side Sound", characteristic of San Antonio, consisted of a blend of genres: [[country music]], [[conjunto]], rhythm and blues, [[polka]] and [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Guerra, Claudia|2018|p=503}}{{sfn|Olsen, Allen|2005}}{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|2020}} Meanwhile, Sahm performed on guitar six nights a week with [[Jimmy Johnson (blues guitarist)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s band.{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|1971|pp=26, 27}} Saxophonist Spot Barnett invited him to play at the Ebony rhythm and blues club.{{sfn|Magnet staff|2002}}

Sahm fronted three bands: The Pharaohs, The Dell-Kings and The Markays. He released the song "Crazy Daisy" (1959), and he had a local hit with "Why Why Why" (1960) on Renner Records.{{sfn|Gart, Gallen|2002|p=104}}{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=22}} Sahm graduated from high school the same year. He had another local hit with "Crazy, Crazy Feeling" (1961);{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|1971|pp=26, 27}} "Just A Moment" (1961) and "Lucky Me" (1963) followed.{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|2011|p=12}} By 1964, Sahm was dropped by the Renner label and he tried to convince [[Huey P. Meaux]] to sign him. Meaux, the owner of [[SugarHill Recording Studios]], was enjoying success with [[Dale Houston#Partnership with Grace Broussard|Dale and Grace]] and [[Barbara Lynn]], and turned Sahm down.{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|2002|p=382}}

Meaux produced songs that appeared on the music charts in the 1960s, but because of [[Beatlemania]] and the [[British Invasion]], his records stopped selling well. Determined to find the reason for the commercial success of [[The Beatles]] sound, Meaux said he purchased several of their records and rented three rooms at the Wayfarer Hotel in San Antonio. According to his account, he drank a case of [[Flavored fortified wine|Thunderbird wine]] in the process.{{sfn|Leigh, Spencer|2016|p=155}} Meaux felt the Beatles' songs shared a common ground with traditional [[Two-step (dance move)|two-step]] [[Cajun music]].{{sfn|Meaux, Francois|2018|p=92}} He called Sahm and asked him to write songs based on that style, and to let his hair grow.{{sfn|Leigh, Spencer|2016|p=155}} Sahm and Meyers appeared with [[The Dave Clark Five]] in San Antonio, where they were featured on the program, with their respective bands, as the opening acts. Sahm appeared with the Markays, and Meyers the Goldens.{{sfn|Busby, Mark|2004|p=340}} Meyers attributed Meaux's interest in recording Sahm and himself to their performance at the concert.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=27}}

Sahm put together a band with Meyers (keyboard), Frank Morin (saxophone), Harvey Kagan (bass) and Johnny Perez (drums).{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|2011|p=12}} Based on The Beatles' "[[She's a Woman]]", Sahm wrote a song that integrated their style with the sounds characteristic of [[tejano music]].{{sfn|Avant-Mier, Roberto|2010|p=100}} Sahm called his new composition "She's A Body Mover". Meaux purchased the song from him for $25 ({{Inflation|US|25|1964|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}), but he felt the title would not help it get airplay. Instead, he renamed it "[[She's About a Mover]]".{{sfn|Meaux, Francois|2018|p=92}} The song was released on [[Tribe Records]] in 1965 and credited to the [[Sir Douglas Quintet]]—an "English-sounding" name created by Meaux to capitalize on the success of the British Invasion.{{sfn|Leszczak, Bob|2014|p=194}}{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|2002|p=382}} The first publicity pictures of the band were taken in silhouette to conceal the appearances of Frank Morin and Johnny Perez, the Latino members of the band.{{sfn|Avant-Mier, Roberto|2010|p=100}} "She's About a Mover" peaked at number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],{{sfn|Leszczak, Bob|2014|p=194}} and reached number 15 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].{{sfn|Rees, Dafydd|Crampton, Luke|1991|p=26}} The success of the song propelled the Sir Douglas Quintet to tour, and to become an opener for The Beatles and [[The Beach Boys]].{{sfn|Buckley, Peter|2003|p=942}} They appeared on ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', and host [[Trini Lopez]] revealed the real origin of the band. The quintet toured the United States with [[James Brown]], and Europe with The Beach Boys and the [[Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Curtis, Gregory|1974|p=47}}

After meeting Sahm in [[New York City]] in 1965, [[Bob Dylan]] said in an interview he felt the Sir Douglas Quintet would be a commercial success on radio. Dylan and Sahm met again in [[London]] while the Sir Douglas Quintet toured England.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=34, 35}} During a stop in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], in December 1965, Sahm and Morin were arrested for possession of [[marijuana]]{{sfn|Walraven, Bill|1965|p=1}} upon their arrival at the [[Corpus Christi International Airport]].

Sahm got the money from his family in San Antonio.{{sfn|Walraven, Bill|1965|p=[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67955704/arrest-part-2/ 12]}} The band pleaded guilty to the charge of "receiving and concealing marijuana without paying the required transfer tax". Judge [[Reynaldo Guerra Garza]] sentenced them to probation with supervision for five years in March 1966.{{sfn|Corpus Christi Caller-Times staff|1966|p=B1}} Meyers was forbidden from leaving Texas for the duration of his probation.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=37}} A series of appearances with the band in small towns around the state made Sahm unhappy. After his parole officer allowed him to leave Texas the same year, he decided to move to [[California]] with his wife and children.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=38}}

==Move to California and return to Texas ==
Sahm moved to [[Salinas, California]], and became involved in [[San Francisco]]'s burgeoning [[hippie]] scene.{{sfn|Magnet staff|2002}} He gathered again with the musicians of the Sir Douglas Quintet, excluding Meyers, whose parole officer did not allow to leave Texas.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=41}} Sahm became acquainted with the music acts playing in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district, and performed at venues including [[The Fillmore]] and the [[Avalon Ballroom]].{{sfn|Magnet staff|2002}} Through audio engineer [[Dan Healy (soundman)|Dan Healy]], Sahm met and befriended [[Jerry Garcia]]. The Sir Douglas Quintet opened for the [[Grateful Dead]] in [[Oakland, California]],{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=43}} and in October 1966 performed with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] featuring [[Janis Joplin]].{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=44}} Helped by lawyer Brian Rohan, who represented the Grateful Dead, Sahm was signed to [[Mercury Records]] and its subsidiary labels.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=44}} In December 1968, Sahm appeared with his son, Shawn, on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. His arrival in San Francisco with the other Texan musicians was covered in the feature "Tribute to the Lone Star State: Dispossessed Men and Mothers of Texas".{{sfn|Sepulvado, Larry|Burks, John|1968}} During the photo shooting, Sahm took his son and sat him on his lap to emulate a childhood photograph that had been taken of him with Hank Williams.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|Sahm, Shawn|2010|p=12}} In 1969, Meyers joined Sahm in San Francisco for the recording of ''[[Mendocino (album)|Mendocino]]''.{{sfn|Magnet staff|2002}} The album's title track reached number 27 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100''.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|1990|p=226}}

'''Doyle Dykes''' (born May 23, 1954) is an American [[Country music|country]] [[Acoustic Guitar|acoustic guitarist]] from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida. Cited along with guitarists such as [[Tommy Emmanuel]] as one of the best fingerstyle guitarists in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomleemusic.com/specialpage/event/ev224/review/index.html|title=Event review|publisher=Tom Lee Music|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928115816/http://www.tomleemusic.com/specialpage/event/ev224/review/index.html|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="NAMM">{{cite web|url=http://www.namm.org/taxonomy/term/1146?page=3|title=Doyle Dykes|publisher=NAMM|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> he is also known for his capability of playing proficiently with a wide range of different guitar tunings. 

Dykes is influenced by a wide variety of musical styles and musicians, from [[Chet Atkins]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[Duane Eddy]], to [[the Beatles]] and [[U2]]. Some of his best-known works and interpretations are "[[Wabash Cannonball]]", "Country Fried Pickin'", "U2 Medley", "Be Still", "[[Amazing Grace]]" and "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]". Dykes is a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and has served as a minister in a small church in Florida;<ref name="Dykes2011, p.75">Dykes (2011), p.75</ref> the influence of Christianity is present in much of his work. He was a major endorser of [[Taylor Guitars]] and [[Rivera Amplifiers|Rivera]] Sedona amplifiers, with his own signature models of each. In 2013 he began endorsing the [[Guild Guitar Company]]. Since 2015 he has touted his custom steel-fret Olson guitar as his "favorite guitar."

== Biography ==
Dykes was born in [[Cleveland, Tennessee|Cleveland]], [[Tennessee]] and grew up in Jacksonville, Florida in a Christian community. His father is referred to as "Bubba Dykes" and he has a brother named Aubrey.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.35"/> He cites June 1965 during his church's "summer revival" as the moment he became a lifelong Christian as an 11-year-old boy, seeing "the lights of salvation and a new purpose and desire for my life and since that day, I've never been the same".<ref name="Dykes2011, p.35">Dykes (2011), p.35</ref> His first guitar was a $30 Sears Roebuck Silvertone acoustic.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.32">Dykes (2011), p.32</ref> Dykes claims a sailor named Barry Lackey was the most important influence in his development as a guitarist. Lackey attended his church one day, and using a thumbpick from his pocket, "completely blew him away" with his "spider picking", playing just like [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Merle Travis]], Doyle's heroes.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.45">Dykes (2011), p.45-7</ref> Lackey was then invited to his home for supper that night and showed him a right-hand picking pattern that "got his fingers working together in the right way, where the thumb played the bass and after-beat rhythm, and the three fingers took care of the rest."<ref name="Dykes2011, p.45"/> He later reunited with Lackey at a Taylor Guitars event in [[Detroit]] in 2002, and said that were it not for him, he would never have become a successful guitarist.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.45"/>

Dykes' early years as a guitarist took him around the world as he toured with [[J. D. Sumner|the Stamps Quartet]] and later with [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Grandpa Jones]]. Dykes has since returned to the Grand Ole Opry for numerous performances. Although a world-renowned guitarist, Dykes frequently plays church venues with small audiences, and some intimate shows that aren't advertised, stating, "I've been blessed with the opportunity to play music for people."<ref name="NAMM"/>
[[File:Dykes and Emmanuel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Performing with [[Tommy Emmanuel]] in the Netherlands, April 2006]]
Dykes was a longtime endorser of [[Taylor Guitars]]. According to owner [[Bob Taylor (luthier)|Bob Taylor]], "If I had to pick the artist who most represented the Taylor Guitars brand and who has done the most for us, I would say Doyle Dykes. Doyle has represented Taylor Guitars to more players for more years than anyone."<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Bob|title=Guitar Lessons: A Life's Journey Turning Passion Into Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvahAJJmN60C&pg=PT111|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-93787-7|page=111}}</ref> The Doyle Dykes Signature Model Taylor guitar (“DDSM”) features an amplification system by L.R. Baggs.

On December 23, 2004, Dykes had an operation on a brain tumor in which the surgeon compressed his brain. The operation left him with a temporary loss of balance (meaning he had to learn to walk again) and suffered from extreme headaches and nausea for several years afterwards and ultimately left him deaf in his right ear.<ref name="Dykes2011, p.197">Dykes (2011), p.197-8</ref> He and his wife, Rita, a high school sweetheart, have been married for at least 37 years and have four children, including daughters named Holly, Heidi and Hayley and a son named Caleb, also an accomplished guitarist. He has resided for many years in the [[Nashville]] area and is a close friend of [[Duane Eddy]]. Dykes is an avid collector of old Western movies, including the films of [[John Wayne]], [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]], and [[Steve McQueen]].<ref name="Dykes2011, p.221">Dykes (2011), p.221</ref> In 2011 he released a book ''The Lights of Marfa'', a semi-autobiographical book documenting his encounters with God, with numerous Christian references to events in his own life.

'''Elvis Aaron Presley'''{{efn|name=name|Although some pronounce his surname {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɛ|z|l|i}} {{respell|PREZ|lee}}, Presley himself pronounced it {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɛ|s|l|i}} {{respell|PRESS|lee}}, as did his family and those who worked with him.{{sfn|Elster|2006|p=391}}<p>The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate. The physician who delivered him wrote "Elvis Aaron Presley" in his ledger.{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} The state-issued birth certificate reads "Elvis Aron Presley". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, "especially on legal documents".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as official.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}}}} (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), known [[Mononym|mononymously]] as '''Elvis''', was an American singer and actor. Known as the "'''King of Rock and Roll'''", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[civil rights movement|transformative era in race relations]], brought both great success and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley#Danger to American culture|initial controversy]].

Presley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]; his family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed him for the rest of his life. Presley's first RCA Victor single, "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular [[rock and roll]]; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans<ref name=":00" /> led to him being widely considered a [[moral panic|threat]] to the moral well-being of [[White Americans|white American]] youth.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=55}}

In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into [[Military career of Elvis Presley|military service in 1958]], he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.

Presley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time, with sales estimated around 500&nbsp;million records worldwide.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales}} He was commercially successful in many genres, including [[Traditional pop|pop]], country, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, [[adult contemporary]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. He won three [[Grammy Awards]], received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]]. He holds several records, including the most [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and the most number-one singles by any act on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], to Gladys Love ({{née|Smith}}) and Vernon Presley.{{sfn|Eames|2022a}}{{sfn|Eames|2022b}} Elvis' twin Jesse Garon was delivered 35 minutes before, [[Stillbirth|stillborn]].{{sfn|Earl|2017}} Presley became close to both parents, especially his mother. The family attended an [[Assembly of God]] church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}} Vernon moved from one [[Handyman|odd job]] to the next,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11–12, 23–24}}{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=419}} and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of [[Cheque fraud|altering a check]] and was jailed for eight months.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}}

In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as "average".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=15–16}} His first public performance was a singing contest at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang "Old Shep" and recalled placing fifth.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=17–18}} A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday;{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=19}}{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=101}} he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very [[shyness|shy]] about it."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}

In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a "trashy" kid who played [[hillbilly music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23–26}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s radio show. He was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates. Slim showed Presley chord techniques.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=19–21}} When his [[Mentorship|protégé]] was 12, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=95–96}}

In November 1948, the family moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=32–33}} Enrolled at [[Humes Preparatory Academy Middle School|L. C. Humes High School]], Presley received a C in [[Music education|music]] in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=36}} He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally [[bullying|bullied]] by classmates for being a "[[mama's boy]]".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=35–38}} In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of [[Lee Denson]], a neighbor. They and three other boys, including two future [[rockabilly]] pioneers, brothers [[Dorsey Burnette|Dorsey]] and [[Johnny Burnette]]—formed a loose musical collective.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=40–41}}

During his junior year, Presley began to stand out among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his [[sideburns]] and styled his hair. He would head down to [[Beale Street]], the heart of Memphis' thriving [[blues]] scene, and admire the wild, flashy clothes at [[Lansky Brothers]]. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} He competed in Humes' Annual "Minstrel" Show in 1953, singing and playing "[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: <blockquote>I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show&nbsp;... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=52–53}}</blockquote>

Presley, who could not [[Musical notation|read music]], played by ear and frequented record stores that provided [[jukebox]]es and listening booths. He knew all of [[Hank Snow]]'s songs,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} and he loved records by other country singers such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis]], and [[Bob Wills]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his [[ballad]]-singing style.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46–48, 358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48, 77–78}} Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as [[WDIA]], that played what were then called "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-heavy [[rhythm and blues]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=38–40}} Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights [[Racial segregation in the United States|designated for exclusively white audiences]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} Many of his future recordings were inspired by local [[African-American music]]ians such as [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus Thomas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=205}} [[B.B. King]] recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.{{sfn|Szatmary|1996|p=35}} By the time he graduated high school in June 1953, Presley had singled out music as his future.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=54}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=8}}

=== 1953–1956: first recordings ===
==== Sam Phillips and Sun Records ====
{{See also|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label}}
[[File:PresleyPromo1954PhotoOnly.jpg|alt=Elvis in a tuxedo|thumb|left|Presley in a [[Sun Records]] promotional photograph, 1954|upright=1.0]]
In August 1953, Presley checked into [[Sun Studio|Memphis Recording Service]], the company run by [[Sam Phillips]] before he started [[Sun Records]]. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: "[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]" and "[[That's When Your Heartaches Begin]]". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he "sounded like". Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62–64}} In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun—"I'll Never Stand in Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an [[audition]] for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} and another for the band of [[Eddie Bond]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}
{{Listen|type=speech|filename=That's All Right.ogg|title="That's All Right" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a "lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence."{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}
Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield "Scotty" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10–11}} The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "[[That's All Right]]". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them." Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94–97}} Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey [[Dewey Phillips]] (no relation to Sam Phillips) played "That's All Right" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–101}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song, [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury-rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A-side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102–104}}

==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====
The trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} Later that month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. Here Elvis pioneered "[[Rubber legs|Rubber Legs]]", his signature dance movement.{{sfn|Miller|2021}}{{sfn|Rodman|2013|p=151}} A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108–111}} Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}

Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]] became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house [[western swing]] band resumed.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=139}} Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117–127, 131}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on October 2; ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128–130}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37–38}}

==== ''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances ====
In November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''—the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127–128, 135–142}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175 ({{Inflation|US|175|1954|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) and his trio began playing in new locales, including [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}} Presley made his first television appearance on the [[KSLA-TV]] broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167–168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6–12}}
[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, September 1956 01.jpg|thumb|230px|Presley performing with [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] in 1956]]
In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed the top country star [[Eddy Arnold]], Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, [[Hank Snow]]. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167–168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6–12}}

By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a [[hillbilly]]."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as "rockabilly". At the time, Presley was billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}

Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him."{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217–219}}

At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28–29}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28–29}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary [[royalty payment|royalties]] in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=36, 54}}{{refn|In 1956–57, Presley was also credited as a co-writer on several songs where he had no hand in the writing process: "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]"; "[[Don't Be Cruel]]"; all four songs from his first film, including the title track, "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]"; "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]"; and "[[All Shook Up]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=35, 51, 57, 61, 75}} (Parker, however, failed to register Presley with such musical licensing firms as [[ASCAP]] and its rival [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], which eventually denied Presley annuity from songwriter's royalties.) Presley received credit on two other songs to which he did contribute: he provided the title for "[[That's Someone You Never Forget]]" (1961), written by his friend and former Humes schoolmate [[Red West]]; they collaborated with another friend, guitarist Charlie Hodge, on "[[You'll Be Gone]]" (1962).{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=157–158, 166, 168}}|name=cowriter|group=lower-alpha}} By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=29}}

=== 1956–1958: commercial breakout and controversy ===
==== First national TV appearances and debut album ====
[[File:Elvis Presley- Billboard ad 1956.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine advertisement, March 10, 1956]]
On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA Victor in Nashville.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} Extending his by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and ''Hayride'' pianist [[Floyd Cramer]]—who had been performing at live club dates with Presley—RCA Victor enlisted guitarist [[Chet Atkins]] and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular [[Jordanaires]] quartet.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=235–136}} The session produced the moody "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", released as a single on January 27.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} Parker brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'' for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]". In February, Presley's "[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}

RCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs, a bouncy pop tune, and what would centrally define the evolving sound of [[rock and roll]]: "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic [[Robert Hilburn]]—and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire, covers of [[Little Richard]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[The Drifters]]. As described by Hilburn, these <blockquote>were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}}</blockquote> It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for ten weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}

On April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''. His performance, on the deck of the [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS ''Hancock'']] in [[San Diego]], California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=262–263}} A few days later, Presley and his band were flying to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over [[Arkansas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=267}} Twelve weeks after its original release, "Heartbreak Hotel" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week [[concert residency|residency]] at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].{{sfn|Koch |Manning |Toplikar |2008}} The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests, "like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party", a ''[[Newsweek]]'' critic wrote.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=274}} Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} He began a tour of the [[American Midwest|Midwest]] in mid-May, covering fifteen cities in as many days.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=72–73}} He had attended several shows by [[Freddie Bell and the Bellboys]] in Vegas and was struck by their cover of "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]", a hit in 1953 for blues singer [[Big Mama Thornton]] by songwriters [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. It became his new closing number.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=273, 284}}

After a show in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. It warned that <blockquote>Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States.&nbsp;... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.&nbsp;... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium.&nbsp;... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls&nbsp;... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph.{{sfn|Fensch|2001|pp=14–18}}</blockquote>

Presley's second ''Milton Berle Show'' appearance came on June 5 at [[NBC]]'s Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. [[Milton Berle]] persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an up-tempo rendition of "Hound Dog" and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} His gyrations created a storm of controversy.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=49}} [[Jack Gould]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, <blockquote>Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.&nbsp;... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.&nbsp;... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body&nbsp;... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.{{sfn|Gould|1956}}</blockquote> Ben Gross of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.&nbsp;... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis&nbsp;... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and [[bordello]]s".{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}} [[Ed Sullivan]], whose [[The Ed Sullivan Show|variety show]] was the nation's most popular, declared Presley "unfit for family viewing".{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "childish".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=100}}

==== ''Steve Allen Show'' and first Sullivan appearance ====
[[File:Elvis Presley and Ed Sullivan October 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Photo of Elvis and Ed Sullivan|[[Ed Sullivan]] and Presley during rehearsals for his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', October 26, 1956]]
The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in New York. [[Steve Allen|Allen]], no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white bowtie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a [[basset hound]] wearing a top hat and bowtie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd&nbsp;... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition".{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=13}} Allen later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" and worked him into the "comedy fabric" of his program.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=270}} Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, "I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance."{{sfn|Rock 'N Roll Stars|1956|p=5}} Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=73}} Later that night, he appeared on ''[[Hy Gardner Calling]]'', a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him, Presley responded, "No, I haven't... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.&nbsp;... how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?"{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}}

The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", "[[Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be)|Any Way You Want Me]]" and "[[Don't Be Cruel]]". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on ''The Steve Allen Show''; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=51}} In August, a judge in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=80–81}} The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for thirty-six years.{{sfn|Whitburn|1993|p=5}} Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood in early September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog", contributed "[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=60–65}}

Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in the ratings. Sullivan booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.{{sfn|Edgerton|2007|p=187}} Actor [[Charles Laughton]] hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} According to legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows, Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock.&nbsp;... I think it's a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] bottle.&nbsp;... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=93}} Sullivan publicly told ''[[TV Guide]]'', "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots."{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=338}}{{sfn|Gibson|2005}} Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}} More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' that made Presley a national celebrity.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}}

Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the "biggest pop craze" since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp; and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: <blockquote>As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.{{sfn|Jezer|1982|p=281}}</blockquote>

==== Crazed crowds and film debut ====
[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, March 1957 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Elvis performing on stage|Presley performing live at the Mississippi-Alabama Fairgrounds in Tupelo, September 26, 1956]]

The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."{{sfn|Moore|Dickerson|1997|p=175}} At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=343}} ''[[Elvis (1956 album)|Elvis]]'', Presley's second RCA Victor album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick, "the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm" showed "the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=335}} Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through ''Elvis'', rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}

{{Listen|filename=Hound Dog & intro (live-Ed Sullivan 2).ogg|title="We're gonna do a sad song&nbsp;..." |description=Presley's definition of rock and roll included a sense of humor—here, during his second Sullivan appearance, he introduces one of his signature numbers.}}
Presley returned to ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] burned him in [[effigy]].{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} His first motion picture, ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original title—''[[Reno Gang|The Reno Brothers]]''—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.{{sfn|O'Malley|2016}}

On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] were recording, and had an impromptu [[jam session]] along with [[Johnny Cash]]. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the "[[Million Dollar Quartet]]" recordings.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=71}} The year ended with a front-page story in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22&nbsp;million on top of his record sales,{{sfn|Palladino|1996|p=131}} and ''Billboard''{{'}}s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=37}} In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}}

==== Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice ====
Presley made his third and final ''Ed Sullivan Show'' appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.{{sfn|Gibson|2005}}{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|pp=117–118}} In any event, as critic [[Greil Marcus]] describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a [[pasha]], if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', with all stops out."{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, "[[Peace in the Valley]]". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy".{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=90}} Two days later, the Memphis [[Conscription in the United States|draft board]] announced that Presley would be [[class 1-A|classified 1-A]] and would probably be drafted sometime that year.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=95}}

Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "[[Too Much (Elvis Presley song)|Too Much]]", "[[All Shook Up]]", and "[[(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released: ''The New York Times'' reported that pressings of his music on [[Ribs (recordings)|discarded X-ray plates]] were commanding high prices in [[Leningrad]].{{sfn|Salisbury|1957|p=4}} Presley purchased his 18-room mansion, [[Graceland]], on March 19, 1957.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=395–397}} Before the purchase, Elvis recorded ''[[Loving You (soundtrack)|Loving You]]''—the soundtrack to [[Loving You (1957 film)|his second film]], which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the ''Jailhouse'' sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck charm".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=406–408, 452}} "He was fast," said Leiber. "Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=178}} The [[Jailhouse Rock (song)|title track]] became another [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|number-one hit]], as was the [[Jailhouse Rock (EP)|''Jailhouse Rock'' EP]].{{sfn|Leigh|2017|p=187}}

[[File:Elvis Presley and Judy Tyler in Jailhouse Rock trailer.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Elvis embraces Judy Tyler|Presley and costar [[Judy Tyler]] in the trailer for ''Jailhouse Rock'', released in October 1957]]
Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=399–402, 428–430, 437–440}} A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} [[Villanova University|Villanova]] students pelted the singer with eggs in [[Philadelphia]],{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} and in [[Vancouver]] the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}} Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.&nbsp;... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.&nbsp;... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=104}} Asked for a response, Presley said: <blockquote>I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=437}}</blockquote>

Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of ''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]''. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: "[[Santa Claus Is Back in Town]]", an [[innuendo]]-laden blues.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=431}} The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the [[List of best-selling Christmas albums in the United States|best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States]],{{sfn|Grein|2008}}{{sfn|Caulfield|2016}} with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide.{{sfn|Baird|2017}} After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned, though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=431–435}}

On December 20, Presley received his draft notice, though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film ''[[King Creole]]''. A couple of weeks into the new year, "[[Don't (Elvis Presley song)|Don't]]", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number-one seller. Recording sessions for the [[King Creole (soundtrack)|''King Creole'' soundtrack]] were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=448–449}} As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off.{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=99, 105}}

On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the [[United States Army]] at [[Fort Chaffee Maneuver Training Center|Fort Chaffee]] in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers accompanied him into the installation.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=461–474}} Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=27}}

During the two weeks' [[Leave (military)|leave]] between his basic and advanced training in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=106–111}} In early August, Presley's mother was diagnosed with [[hepatitis]], and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure at age 46. Presley was devastated and never the same;{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=474–480}}{{sfn|Neibaur|2014|p=[{{GBurl|id=u95XAwAAQBAJ|q=elvis presley was never the same after the army|p=51}} 51]}} their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}}

While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to [[amphetamines]] and became "practically evangelical about their benefits", not only for energy but for "strength" and weight loss.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=21}} Karate became a lifelong interest: he studied with [[Jürgen Seydel]],{{sfn|Tillery|2013|p=60}}{{sfn|Eiland|2018}} and later included it in his live performances.{{sfn|Corcoran|1998}}{{sfn|Tillery|2013|loc=Chapter 5: Patriot}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=47, 49, 55, 60, 73}} Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased television sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|p=160}} Presley was promoted to [[sergeant]] on February 11, 1960.{{sfn|US Department of Defense|1960}}

While in [[Bad Nauheim]], Presley, aged 24, met 14-year-old [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla Beaulieu]].<!--She took the surname Presley after her marriage, thus, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Biography#People_with_the_same_surname, is referred to by name as "Priscilla" to distinguish her from "Elvis".-->{{sfn|Jeffrey|Kaplan|2022}} They would marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career. In [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]], he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve as a regular soldier.{{sfn|Presley|1985|p=40}} Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA Victor producer [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] and [[Freddy Bienstock]] of Hill and Range had carefully prepared: armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=107}} Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top-40 hits, including "[[Wear My Ring Around Your Neck]]", the bestselling "[[Hard Headed Woman]]", and "[[One Night (Elvis Presley song)|One Night]]" in 1958, and "[[(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I]]" and the number-one "[[A Big Hunk o' Love]]" in 1959.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=520}} RCA Victor also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully ''[[Elvis' Golden Records]]'' (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=278}}

Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis|The Frank Sinatra Timex Special]]''. Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62–63}}

''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I. Blues]]'', the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'', followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely "a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}

Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted [[musical comedy|musical comedies]]. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein—''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a "pantheon of bad taste".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine, declared, "A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood."{{sfn|Fields|2007}}

Of Presley's films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—Presley frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: "three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew "progressively worse".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}}
[[File:Elvis Presley and Priscilla with Lisa Marie February 1968.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Presley and his wife, [[Priscilla Presley]], holding their newborn daughter, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in 1968]]
In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]" (1961) and "[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: "[[Crying in the Chapel]]" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was "arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}

Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261–263}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. "By then, of course, the damage had been done", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. "Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans."{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}

=== 1968–1973: Comeback ===
==== ''Elvis'': the '68 Comeback Special ====

Presley's only child, [[Lisa Marie Presley|Lisa Marie]], was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=171}} Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, none higher than number 28.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=521}} His forthcoming soundtrack album, ''[[Speedway (album)|Speedway]]'', would rank at number 82. Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}

Recorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, simply called ''Elvis'', aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked: <blockquote>There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}}</blockquote> Marsh calls the performance one of "emotional grandeur and historical resonance".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}

By January 1969, the single "[[If I Can Dream]]", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what "he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man."{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.{{'"}}{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}}

==== ''From Elvis in Memphis'' and the International ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Power of My Love.ogg|title="Power of My Love" |description=Beginning with his American Sound recordings, [[soul music]] became a central element in Presley's fusion of styles. Here, he revels in lyrics full of sexual innuendos.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=277}}}}
Buoyed by the experience of the ''Comeback Special'', Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at [[American Sound Studio]], which led to the acclaimed ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]''. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is "a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single "[[In the Ghetto]]", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since "Bossa Nova Baby" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: "[[Suspicious Minds]]", "[[Don't Cry Daddy]]", and "[[Kentucky Rain]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=419}}

Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the ''Comeback Special'', offers came in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker {{US$|28,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|28000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for a one-week engagement. He responded, "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand-new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Costume designer [[Bill Belew]], responsible for the intense leather styling of the ''Comeback Special'', created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=343}} Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346–347}}

Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, "Can't Help Falling in Love" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149–150}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as "The King", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. "No," Presley said, "that's the real king of rock and roll."{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''[[Newsweek]]'' commented, "There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars."{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley "supernatural, his own resurrection."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis]]'' came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. "Suspicious Minds" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop number-one]] in over seven years, and his last.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|pp=521–522}}

[[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas. She recalled of their encounter, "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked [[marijuana]], and he was just appalled."{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley also rarely drank—several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.{{sfn|Mason|2007|p=81}}

==== Back on tour and meeting Nixon ====

Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album ''[[On Stage (Elvis Presley album)|On Stage]]''.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=94}} In late February, Presley performed six attendance-record–breaking shows at the [[Houston Astrodome]].{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=95}} In April, the single "[[The Wonder of You#Elvis Presley version|The Wonder of You]]" was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary]] chart as well. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|50000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a [[Derringer]] in his right boot and a [[.45 caliber]] [[pistol]] in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=96}}

''[[That's the Way It Is (Elvis Presley album)|That's the Way It Is]]'', produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, <blockquote>The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}}</blockquote> After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the [[Southern United States|South]], his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], followed in November.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=99}}

They are facing camera and smiling. Five flags hang from poles directly behind them.|Presley meets US President [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[White House]] [[Oval Office]], December 21, 1970]]
On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]], where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the [[hippie]]s to help combat the [[drug culture]] he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge, to signify official sanction of his efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he "retain his credibility".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=419–422}} Presley told Nixon that [[the Beatles]], whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era,{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=284, 286, 307–308, 313, 326, 338, 357–358}} exemplified what he saw as a trend of [[anti-Americanism]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=420}} Presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the Beatles at his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air, California]], in August 1965. [[Paul McCartney]] later said that he "felt a bit betrayed.&nbsp;... The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's early death linked to [[prescription drug abuse]].{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=192}}

The [[United States Junior Chamber|U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce]] named Presley one of its annual [[Ten Outstanding Young Americans|Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation]] on January 16, 1971.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=321}} Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of [[U.S. Route 51|Highway 51 South]] on which Graceland is located "Elvis Presley Boulevard". The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] (then known as the Bing Crosby Award).{{sfn|McPhate|2017}}{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=299–300}} Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was ''[[Elvis Country]]'', a [[Concept album|concept record]] that focused on genre standards.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=319}} The biggest seller was ''[[Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas]]''. According to Greil Marcus, <blockquote>In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of "[[Merry Christmas Baby]]", a raunchy old [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]] blues.{{nbsp}}[...] If [Presley's] sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=284–185}}</blockquote>

In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the [[Kui Lee]] Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]'', which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, ''Aloha from Hawaii'' aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan, where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week, it smashed viewing records.

At a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presley's defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, Presley raged, "There's too much pain in me&nbsp;... Stone [must] die." His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, [[Red West]], his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a [[contract killing]] and was relieved when Presley decided, "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=488–490}}

=== 1973–1977: health deterioration and death ===
==== Medical crises and last studio sessions ====
Presley's divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=329}} By then, his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his primary care physician, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley "felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519–520}}

Presley's condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] remembered his arrival at a [[University of Maryland]] concert: "He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, 'Is the tour gonna happen'?"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=547}} Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled: <blockquote>He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.&nbsp;... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.&nbsp;... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions.{{sfn|Hopkins|1986|p=136}}</blockquote>

RCA began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=560}} Parker delivered RCA another concert record, ''[[Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=336}} Recorded on March 20, it included a version of "[[How Great Thou Art]]" that won Presley his third and final [[Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=381}}{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} All three of his competitive Grammy wins{{snd}}out of fourteen total nominations{{snd}}were for gospel recordings.{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} Presley returned to the recording studio in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=584–585}} In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=593–595}} However, the recording process had become a struggle for him.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=595}}

After Presley's relationship with Linda Thompson ended,{{sfn|Gostin|2023}} he began dating Ginger Alden in November 1976; he proposed marriage to Alden two months later.{{sfn|Speakman|2023}}

Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that, by early 1977, "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts."{{sfn|Scherman|2006}} According to Andy Greene of ''Rolling Stone'', Presley's final performances were mostly "sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch."{{sfn|Greene|2018}} In [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], he was on stage for less than an hour and "was impossible to understand".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=628}} On March 31, he canceled a performance in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=628–630}}

Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualism]] books".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=634}} Presley's cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite [[Monty Python]] sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=212, 642}}

"[[Way Down]]", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, was released on June 6, 1977. That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special, ''[[Elvis in Concert]]'', to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Two days later, in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], South Dakota, "he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was "framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Presley's final concert was held in [[Indianapolis]] at [[Market Square Arena]], on June 26, 1977.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=23}}

On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to [[Portland, Maine]], to begin another tour. That afternoon, however, his fiancée Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion.{{sfn|Alden|2014}} Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at [[Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis|Baptist Memorial Hospital]] at 3:30&nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=645–648}} He was 42.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=242}}

President [[Jimmy Carter]] issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of American popular culture".{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted {{US$|18000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|18000|1977|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the ''[[National Enquirer]]''{{'}}s biggest-selling issue ever.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=386}} Alden struck a $105,000 ({{Inflation|US|105000|1977|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) deal with the ''Enquirer'' for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=660}} Presley left her nothing in his [[will and testament|will]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=581–582}}

Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on August 18. Outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third.{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=26}} About 80,000 people lined the processional route to [[Forest Hill Cemetery (Memphis, Tennessee)|Forest Hill Cemetery]], where Presley was buried next to his mother.{{sfn|Pendergast|Pendergast|2000|p=108}} Within a few weeks, "Way Down" topped the country and UK singles chart.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}}{{sfn|Warwick|Kutner|Brown|2004|pp=860–866}} Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=660}}

=== Cause of death ===
While an [[autopsy]] undertaken the same day Presley died was still in progress, Memphis [[Coroner|medical examiner]] Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that "drugs played no role in Presley's death".{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} In fact, "drug use was heavily implicated" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered "[[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported "fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651–653}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of [[depressant]]s had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: "Elvis had  an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call."{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}}

The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was [[cardiac arrhythmia]], a condition that can be determined only in a living person; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}} While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, George C. Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability, the facts were startling: "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of [[sedative]]s, [[amphetamine]]s, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name." Nichopoulos' license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}

In 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack."{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then."{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11–14}} One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, <blockquote>could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with [[diabetes]], glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and [[methadone]] treatments.{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11–14}}</blockquote>

=== Later developments ===
Between 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}} Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=433}} The residence was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2006.{{sfn|National Park Service|2010}}

Presley has been inducted into five music [[Hall of fame|halls of fame]]: the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1986), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1998), the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2001), the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] (2007), and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] (2012). In 1984, he received the [[Blues Music Award|W. C. Handy Award]] from the [[Blues Foundation]] and the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the [[American Music Award]]s' Award of Merit.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=33}}

A [[Tom Holkenborg|Junkie XL]] remix of Presley's "[[A Little Less Conversation]]" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") was used in a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertising campaign during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's number-one hits, ''[[ELV1S]]'', which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the ''Billboard'' chart for the first time in almost three decades.{{sfn|Garrity|2002}}

In 2003, a remix of "[[Rubberneckin']]", a 1969 recording, topped the U.S. sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of "That's All Right" the following year.{{sfn|Bronson|2004|p=1}} The latter was an outright hit in Britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in Canada.{{sfn|"Hits of the World"|2004}} In 2005, another three reissued singles, "Jailhouse Rock", "One Night"/"I Got Stung", and "It's Now or Never", went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all eighteen of Presley's previous chart-topping UK singles. The first, "All Shook Up", came with a collectors' box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top five.{{sfn|Sexton|2007}}

In 2005, [[Forbes (magazine)|''Forbes'' magazine]] named Presley the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid dead celebrity|top-earning deceased celebrity]] for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of $45&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Goldman|Ewalt|2007}} He was placed second in 2006,{{sfn|Rose|2006}} returned to the top spot the next two years,{{sfn|Goldman|Paine|2007}}{{sfn|Hoy|2008}} and ranked fourth in 2009.{{sfn|Pomerantz et al.|2009}} The following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income ever—$60&nbsp;million—spurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s ''[[Viva Elvis]]'' show in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Rose et al.|2010}} In November 2010, ''[[Viva Elvis (album)|Viva Elvis: The Album]]'' was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks.{{sfn|Baillie|2010}}{{sfn|Bouchard|2010}} As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products,{{sfn|Lynch|2011}} and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity.{{sfn|Pomerantz|2011}} Six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of $35&nbsp;million, up $8&nbsp;million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, Elvis Presley's Memphis, and hotel, The Guest House at Graceland.{{sfn|Greenburg|2017}}

In 2018, RCA/[[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]] released ''[[Where No One Stands Alone (album)|Elvis Presley – Where No One Stands Alone]]'', a new album focused on Presley' love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and [[Andy Childs]], the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album's title track.{{sfn|Legacy|2018}}

In 2022, [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s film ''[[Elvis (2022 film)|Elvis]]'', a biographical film about Presley's life, was released. Presley is portrayed by [[Austin Butler]] and Parker by [[Tom Hanks]]. As of August 2022, the film had grossed $261.8 million worldwide on a $85 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all-time behind ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' (2018), and the [[List of highest-grossing films in Australia|fifth-highest-grossing Australian-produced]] film.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Presley's earliest musical influence came from [[gospel music|gospel]]. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, "he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=14}} In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the [[Ellis Auditorium]], where groups such as the [[The Statesmen Quartet|Statesmen Quartet]] led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:

{{blockquote|The Statesmen were an electric combination&nbsp;... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world&nbsp;... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's.&nbsp;... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. "He went about as far as you could go in gospel music," said [[Jake Hess]]. "The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows." Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements&nbsp;... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48}}}}

[[Early life of Elvis Presley#Teenage life in Memphis|As a teenager]], Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, "He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, "I know practically every religious song that's ever been written."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}

=== Musicianship ===
Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.{{sfn|Graceland Blog|2015}} Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums. Presley played piano on songs such as "[[Old Shep]]" and "First in Line" from his 1956 album ''[[Elvis (1956 album)|Elvis]]''.{{sfn|Osborne|2017|p=[{{GBurl|id=CE6JPQyNKawC|p=73}} 73]}} He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' and "[[Moody Blue (Elvis song)|Moody Blue]]", and on "[[Unchained Melody]]", which was one of the last songs that he recorded.{{sfn|Duffett|2018|p=[{{GBurl|id=a7hJDwAAQBAJ|p=189}} 189]}} Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight]]".{{sfn|Murray|1961|p=65}} At one point during the [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]], Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as "[[Baby What You Want Me to Do]]" and "[[One Night (Elvis Presley song)|One Night]]".{{sfn|Marcus|2015|p=[{{GBurl|id=trEBDAAAQBAJ|p=341}} 341]}} The album ''[[Elvis is Back!]]'' features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as "[[I Will Be Home Again]]" and "[[Like a Baby]]".{{sfn|Eder|2013|p=[{{GBurl|id=XcYIAgAAQBAJ|pg=PT149}} 149]}}

=== Musical styles and genres ===
[[File:Elvis Presley and the Jordanaires 1957.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis and the Jordanaires|Presley with his longtime vocal backup group, the [[Jordanaires]], March 1957]]
Presley was a central figure in the development of [[rockabilly]], according to music historians. "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label," writes Craig Morrison.{{sfn|Morrison|1996|p=x}} Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as "essentially&nbsp;... an Elvis Presley construction", with the defining elements as "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} In "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, "a combination of [[Merle Travis]]–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} While Katherine Charlton calls Presley "rockabilly's originator",{{sfn|Charlton|2006|p=103}} [[Carl Perkins]], another pioneer of rock'n'roll, said that "[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly".{{sfn|Jancik|1998|p=16}} According to [[Michael Campbell (pianist and author)|Michael Campbell]], the first major rockabilly song was recorded by [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]].{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=161}} In Moore's view, "It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old."{{sfn|Guralnick|1989|p=104}}

At RCA Victor, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars,{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense manner.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=39}} While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard "[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]" at Sun Records to the country ballad "How's the World Treating You?" on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of "Santa Claus Is Back in Town". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Run On.ogg|title="Run On" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition. The arrangement evokes "the percussive style of the 1930s [[Golden Gate Quartet]]."{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=22}}{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=184}}}}
After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five "[[She's Not You]]" (1962) "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as "[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]" and "[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number-one in 1960. "It's Now or Never", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song "{{lang|nap|[['O sole mio]]|italic=no}}" and concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142–143}}

While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become "hard to find".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis in Memphis'', as well as "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}

=== Vocal style and range ===
[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the [[CBS]] program ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'', January 16, 1956]]

The developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from "high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the "vocal stutter" on 1955's "[[Baby Let's Play House]]".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on "Don't Be Cruel", Presley "slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses," he shows "how masterful his relaxed style really is."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on "Can't Help Falling in Love" as one of "gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing", with the line {{"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}

Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions", as Presley "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax", becoming "a kind of one-man quartet".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds "[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand by Me]]" from the same gospel sessions "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on "Where No One Stands Alone", resorting "to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: "The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}

Marsh praises his 1968 reading of "[[U.S. Male]]", "bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on "In the Ghetto" is, according to Jorgensen, "devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms", instead relying on the exceptional "clarity and sensitivity of his voice".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of "almost translucent eloquence&nbsp;... so quietly confident in its simplicity".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On "Suspicious Minds", Guralnick hears essentially the same "remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise", but supplemented with "an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}

Music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that "Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, "from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was "variable and unpredictable" at the bottom, "often brilliant" at the top, with the capacity for "full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all."{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}

When Dewey Phillips first aired "That's All Right" on Memphis' [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–101}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]—the originator of "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw."{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley "cracked Memphis' segregation laws" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its "colored night".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex."<ref name=":00" />

Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." A journalist with the national African American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''Jailhouse Rock'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: <blockquote>I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.{{sfn|Williams|2012}}</blockquote> Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}

The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had "stolen" black music still found adherents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ushe |first1=Naledi |title=Appropriation or appreciation?

Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that]."{{sfn|Osborne|2000|p=207}} Nine years earlier, he had said, "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=198}}

=== Sex symbol ===

Along with title and credits is the tagline "Climb aboard your dreamboat for the fastest-movin' fun 'n' music!"|Poster for the film ''[[Girls! Girls! Girls!]]'' (1962), visualizing Presley's sex symbol image]]
Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", according to critic [[Mark Feeney]].{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} Television director Steve Binder reported, "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence."{{sfn|Ashley|2009|p=76}} His performance style was equally responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Critic [[George Melly]] described him as "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=58}} In his Presley obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him with bringing "overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58–59}} Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.{{sfn|Garber|1997|p=366}}

While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, ''[[Sight and Sound]]''{{'}}s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as "aggressively bisexual in appeal".{{Sfn|Dyer|1959–1960|p=30}} Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the title dance sequence in ''Jailhouse Rock'' within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image".{{sfn|Farmer|2000|p=86}} In the analysis of [[Yvonne Tasker]], "Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display."{{sfn|Tasker|2007|p=208}}

Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with Hollywood stars and starlets, from [[Natalie Wood]] in the 1950s to [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1960s to [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Cybill Shepherd]] in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=109}}

|quote=I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but&nbsp;... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today. He's worshiped as a god today because in addition to inventing rock and roll he was the greatest ballad singer this side of [[Frank Sinatra]]—because the spiritual translucence and reined-in gut sexuality of his slow weeper and torchy pop blues still activate the hormones and slavish devotion of millions of female human beings worldwide.

Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.{{sfn|Collins|2002}} As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.{{sfn|Sadie|1994|p=638}} With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=94}}

In this regard, [[Little Richard]] said of Presley, "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=193}} [[Al Green]] agreed: "He broke the ice for all of us."{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=356}}

President [[Jimmy Carter]] remarked on Presley's legacy in 1977: "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture."{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.{{sfn|Arnett|2006|p=400}}

[[File:Elvis impersonators record.jpg|thumb|[[Elvis impersonator|Elvis impersonators]] in 2005]]
Presley's name, image, and voice are recognized around the world.{{sfn|Doss|1999|p=2}} He has inspired [[Elvis impersonator|a legion of impersonators]].{{sfn|Lott|Uebel|1997|p=192}} In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans.{{refn|[[VH1]] ranked Presley No.&nbsp;8 among the "100 Greatest Artists of Rock & Roll" in 1998.{{sfn|VH1|1998}} The [[BBC]] ranked him as the No.&nbsp;2 "Voice of the Century" in 2001.{{sfn|BBC News|2001}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him No.&nbsp;3 in its list of "The Immortals: The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time" in 2004.{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2004}} [[Country Music Television|CMT]] ranked him No.&nbsp;15 among the "40 Greatest Men in Country Music" in 2005.{{sfn|CMT|2005}} The [[Discovery Channel]] placed him No.&nbsp;8 on its "Greatest American" list in 2005.{{sfn|Discovery Channel|2005}} ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' put him in the top ten of its "100 Icons of the Century" in 2005.{{sfn|Variety|2005}} ''[[The Atlantic]]'' ranked him No.&nbsp;66 among the "100 Most Influential Figures in American History" in 2006.{{sfn|Atlantic|2006}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him No.&nbsp;17 on its 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2023}}|name=ranking|group=lower-alpha}} American composer and conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] said, "Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century.

[[File:Elvis Presley Hollywood Walk of Fame Star.jpg|thumb|Presley's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6777 Hollywood Blvd]]

For much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the [[American Dream]].{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=xv}}{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=149}} In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony.{{sfn|Cosby|2016|p=144}}{{sfn|Doll|2016|p=186}} Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy [[Southern cooking]] of his upbringing, foods such as [[chicken-fried steak]] and [[biscuits and gravy]].{{sfn|Martin|2000}}{{sfn|Smith|2002}} In particular, his love of fried [[peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich|peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches]],{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=227, 256}}{{sfn|Martin|2000}} now known as "Elvis sandwiches",{{sfn|Wilson|2010|p=121}} came to symbolize this characteristic.{{sfn|Slater|2002}}

Since 1977, there have been numerous [[Elvis sightings|alleged sightings of Presley]]. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death.{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=42, 157–160, 169}}{{sfn|Clarke|2006|pp=77, 80}} Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=159–160}} An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=10}} On the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual.{{sfn|Segré|2002}} "With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death", writes Ted Harrison. "He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation."{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=10}}

On the 25th anniversary of Presley's death, ''The New York Times'' asserted: <blockquote>All the talentless impersonators and appalling [[velvet Elvis|black velvet paintings]] on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.&nbsp;... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.{{sfn|New York Times|2002}}</blockquote>

He was ranked third on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of greatest artists. [[Bono]] wrote in appreciation: <blockquote>In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness — the gospel highs. The mud — the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.{{sfn|Bono|2010|loc="Elvis"}}</blockquote>

 Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:<blockquote>Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.&nbsp;... Elvis has emerged as a great ''artist'', a great ''rocker'', a great ''purveyor of schlock'', a great ''heart throb'', a great ''bore'', a great ''symbol of potency'', a great ''ham'', a great ''nice person'', and, yes, a great American.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=141–142}}</blockquote>

''Billboard'' now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens. ''Billboard'' now states that they yielded just two number ones and a total of two top tens, voiding the separate chart appearances of "Hound Dog" and "I Beg of You".|name=billboard|group=lower-alpha}} According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with [[Madonna]];{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=875}} per ''Billboard''{{'}}s current assessment, he ranks second with 36.{{sfn|Hasty|2008}} Whitburn and ''Billboard'' concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that [[Mariah Carey]] is second with 19.{{sfn|Trust|2022}} Whitburn has Presley with 18:{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=875}} ''Billboard'' has him third with 17.{{sfn|Moody|2008}} According to&nbsp;''Billboard'',&nbsp; Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone at 80, according to Whitburn and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=876}}{{sfn|RRHF|2010}} with only Mariah Carey having more with 91 weeks.{{sfn|Trust|2023}} He holds the records for most number-one singles on the UK chart with 21 and singles reaching the top ten with 76.{{sfn|Myers|2022}}{{sfn|Myers|2021}}

As an album artist, Presley is credited by ''Billboard'' with the record for the most albums charting in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]: 129, far ahead of second-place Frank Sinatra's 82. He also holds the record for most cumulative weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 for a male solo artists: 67 weeks{{sfn|Trust|2015}} In 2015 and 2016, two albums setting Presley's vocals against music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, ''[[If I Can Dream (album)|If I Can Dream]]'' and ''[[The Wonder of You (Elvis Presley album)|The Wonder of You]]'', both reached number one in the UK. This gave him a new record for number-one UK albums by a solo artist with 13, and extended his record for longest span between number-one albums by anybody—Presley had first topped the British chart in 1956 with his self-titled debut.{{sfn|Sexton|2016}}

{{as of|2023}}, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5&nbsp;million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and [[Garth Brooks]].{{sfn|RIAA|2020a}} He holds the records for most [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|gold albums]] (101, nearly double second-place [[Barbra Streisand]]'s 51),{{sfn|RIAA|2020b}} and most platinum albums (57).{{sfn|RIAA|2020c}} His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles' 26.{{sfn|RIAA|2020d}} His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles' second-best 122.{{sfn|Lewis|2017}} He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with [[Justin Bieber]]),{{sfn|RIAA|2020e}} and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).{{sfn|RIAA|2020f}}

In 2012, the spider ''[[Paradonea presleyi]]'' was named in his honor.{{sfn|Miller |Griswold |Scharff |Rezac |2012}} In 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] awarded Presley the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] posthumously.{{sfn|BBC News|2018}}

{{Main|Elvis Presley albums discography|Elvis Presley singles discography|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley}}

A vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as 665{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=438}} and 711.{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} His career began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music. For his albums, the distinction between "official" studio records and other forms is often blurred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

==Early life==
EmiSunshine was born on June 8, 2004, in [[Madisonville, Tennessee]], to Randall Hamilton, a musician and recording engineer, and Alisha Karol Hamilton, a songwriter and nurse. Randall and Alisha have said that, even as a baby, EmiSunshine exhibited a remarkable musical ability, humming along to songs with perfect pitch. "I noticed it at nine months," Randall told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. "There was a pure tone in the key of C coming out of her. I thought, 'This baby is something. She may be able to sing when she is older.'" By the age of three, she was singing with her grandmothers. Her first performance in front of an audience occurred at age four, when she performed "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" at the wedding of her aunt and uncle.<ref name="ChicagoTribune.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-emi-sunshine-gran-old-opry-20150813-story.html|title=EmiSunshine is all country, all the time, at age 11|date=August 13, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

EmiSunshine began singing in churches and festivals throughout East Tennessee. At the age of seven she simultaneously recorded her first two albums, ''Strong as the Tall Pine'' and ''Wide River to Cross'' in her father's studio with help from her father and her grandfather, "PaPaw Bill".<ref name="tennessean.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/12/11/emi-sunshine-sings-like-old-soul-sparkles-stage-age/20281257/|title=EmiSunshine sings like old soul, sparkles at age 10|date=December 11, 2014|work=The Tennessean}}</ref>

==Career==
===2013–2015: Breakthrough===
When EmiSunshine was nine years old, a fan in her hometown posted a video on YouTube of her singing the [[Jimmie Rodgers (pop singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Louis Armstrong]] song "Blue Yodel No. 6" at a flea market. The video went viral, attracting millions of views. As a result, she was invited to perform on NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'']] show. Video of her televised performance attracted even more attention on the Internet and among country music professionals in Nashville.<ref name="NewJerseyStage.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.newjerseystage.com/articles/2018/03/22/an-interview-with-emisunshine/|title=An Interview with EmiSunshine|date=March 22, 2018|work=New Jersey Stage}}</ref>

Soon, she was writing songs and appearing on stage with established artists. In 2014, she made her debut performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. She released her first single, "Oh Mary, Where Is Your Baby?" in 2014 and a year later released her next single, "I Am Able." She released the full-length album ''Black Sunday '35'' when she was nine years old. 
Also during this time, she opened for Willie Nelson in Southern California and Las Vegas, Tanya Tucker and Loretta Lynn in Branson.

===2016–present: Continued success===
In 2016, at age 12, EmiSunshine appeared in ''[[The King (2017 American film)|The King]]'', a documentary film about [[Elvis Presley]], which featured celebrities such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Ashton Kutcher]] and others.<ref name="Columbus Ledger-Enquirer">{{cite web|url=https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/entertainment/local-events/article228956464.html|title=Tennessee girl in viral YouTube video is now grown-up star you can see in concert|date=April 8, 2019|work=Columbus Ledger-Enquirer}}</ref> In the movie, she sang two songs she had previously written, “Danny Ray" and "Johnny June and Jesus," which she performed while riding in the backseat of Elvis Presley's 1963 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. She later performed at the film's international premiere at the 2017 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The soundtrack was nominated for a [[Grammy]] award.<ref name="Variety.com">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammy-nominations-2019-complete-list-1203082934/|title=Grammy Awards Nominations: The Complete List|date=December 7, 2018|work=Variety}}</ref>

She released her fourth studio album, ''Ragged Dreams'', in 2017, which included her two songs from ''The King''. She also attracted attention for another song on that album, "90 Miles", which was about [[autism]]. "I have a really good friend who has autism, and he was treated really differently because of it and it really bothered me," she told the ''[[South Bend Tribune]]''. "I met him and I didn't know that he had autism. The kids would tell me not to talk to him, even adults… I want this song to be something that just kind of shows people that, hey, they’re just like us."<ref name="southbendtribune.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/entertainment/inthebend/music/emisunshine-brings-fresh-face-to-country-music/article_b692f027-309e-54e3-a099-e9caee446b47.html|title=EmiSunshine brings fresh face to country music|date=April 22, 2018|work=South Bend Tribune}}</ref>

She began working with four-time Grammy-winning producer [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] in 2017, after she was introduced to him by her manager, Steve Pritchard.<ref name="lula1892.com">{{cite web|url=http://lula1892.com/elvis-strait-to-jesus/|title=Elvis, Strait To Jesus: Tony Brown On His Life In The Music Industry And His Brand New Book|date=June 6, 2018|work=Lula 1892}}</ref>  Emi and Brown co-produced her sixth studio album, ''Family Wars'', which was released in 2019. The album includes a duet with singer-songwriter [[Jim Lauderdale]], back up singing on one song by The McCrary Sisters and creative collaborations with other prominent musical artists in Nashville including songwriters [[Vicky McGehee]], [[Kyle Jacobs (songwriter)|Kyle Jacobs]], [[Chelle Rose]], Autumn McEntire and Fish Fisher. In a review, the music magazine ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' wrote that the album "establishes EmiSunshine as a strong creative force… She's just plain good, with talents outliving the novelty that went along with her earliest exposure at age 9 and establishing her as someone bold and talented enough to tackle today’s issues while honoring yesterday’s folk traditions."<ref name="nodepression.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nodepression.com/album-reviews/15-year-old-emisunshine-balances-darkness-and-light-on-family-wars/|title=15-Year-Old EmiSunshine Balances Darkness and Light on 'Family Wars'|date=October 17, 2019|work=No Depression}}</ref>

'''Gregory LeNoir Allman''' (December 8, 1947&nbsp;– May 27, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]", "[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]", and "[[Midnight Rider]]". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and then [[Macon, Georgia]].

He and his brother [[Duane Allman]] formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released  ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star [[Cher]]. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song "[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012). His final album, ''[[Southern Blood (album)|Southern Blood]]'', was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.

Allman performed with a [[Hammond organ]] and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a [[Southern rock]] pioneer<ref>Sources:

== Early life ==
[[File:Lebanon tennessee city hall.jpg|thumb|Allman and his brother [[Duane Allman|Duane]] attended [[Castle Heights Military Academy]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] in their childhood.]]
Gregory LeNoir Allman was born on December 8, 1947, at [[Saint Thomas - West Hospital|Saint Thomas Hospital]] in Nashville, [[Tennessee]] to Geraldine Robbins Allman (1917–2015) and Willis Turner Allman (1918–1949).{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=9–12}} The couple had met during [[World War II]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], North Carolina when Allman was on leave from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], and were later married. Their first child, Duane Allman, was born in Nashville in November 20,1946. On December 26, 1949, Willis offered a ride home to a hitchhiker, who shot and killed him in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia.<ref name="HR15">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gregg-allman-my-cross-bear-cher-319596|title=BOOK REVIEW: 'My Cross to Bear' by Gregg Allman With Alan Light|date=May 16, 2012|first=Andy|last=Lewis|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The night Gregg Allman's dad died in Norfolk |url=http://pilotonline.com/news/local/history/the-night-gregg-allman-s-dad-died-in-norfolk/article_f5958a5d-e40f-53b6-b9f4-acbc1c7d8f93.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808195439/https://www.pilotonline.com/news/local/history/the-night-gregg-allman-s-dad-died-in-norfolk/article_f5958a5d-e40f-53b6-b9f4-acbc1c7d8f93.html|archive-date=August 8, 2017|last=Ollison |first=Rashod |publisher=The Virginian Pilot|date=June 1, 2017}}</ref> Geraldine moved to Nashville with her two sons and never remarried.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=4}} Lacking money to support her children, she enrolled in college to become a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA)—state laws at the time, according to her son, required students to live on-campus.<ref name="RS73">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-allman-brothers-story-19731206|title=The Allman Brothers Story|date=December 6, 1973|first=Cameron|last=Crowe|author-link=Cameron Crowe|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref>

As a result, Gregg and his older brother were sent to [[Castle Heights Military Academy]] in nearby [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=9–12}} A young Gregg interpreted these actions as evidence of his mother's dislike for him, though he later came to understand the reality: "She was actually sacrificing everything she possibly could—she was working around the clock, getting by just by a hair, so as to not send us to an [[orphanage]], which would have been a living hell."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=14}} While his brother adapted to his surroundings with a defiant attitude, Allman felt largely depressed at the school. With little to do, he studied often and developed an interest in medicine—had he not gone into music, he hoped to become a dentist.<ref name="SL07" /> He was rarely hazed at Castle Heights as his brother protected him, but often suffered beatings from instructors when he received poor grades.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=16}} The brothers returned to Nashville upon their mother's graduation, and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in 1959.<ref name="RS73" /> Allman would later recall two separate events in his life that led to his interest in music. In 1960, the two brothers attended a concert in Nashville with [[Jackie Wilson]] headlining alongside [[Otis Redding]], [[B.B.

Gregg worked as a [[paper boy]] to afford a [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] guitar, which he purchased at a [[Sears]] when he saved up enough funds.<ref name="RS73" /> Like his brother, he was left-handed, but played the guitar right-handed. He and his brother often fought to play the instrument, though there was "no question that music brought" the two together.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=31}} In Daytona, they joined a [[YMCA]] group called the Y Teens, their first experience performing music with others.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} He and Duane returned to Castle Heights in their teen years, where they formed a band, the Misfits.<ref name="PLEASE">{{cite book|title=Please Be with Me: A Song for My Father, Duane Allman|last=Allman |first=Gladrielle |location=New York City |publisher=[[Spiegel & Grau]] |page=70 |isbn=978-1-4000-6894-4|year=2014}}</ref> Despite this, he still felt "lonesome and out of place", and quit the academy.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=41}} He returned to Daytona Beach and pursued music further, and the duo formed another band, the Shufflers, in 1963.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} He attended high school at [[Seabreeze High School]], where he graduated in 1965.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=28}} However, he grew undisciplined in his studies as his interests diverged: "Between the women and the music, school wasn't a priority anymore."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=42}}

The two Allman brothers began meeting various musicians in the Daytona Beach area. They met a man named [[Floyd Miles]], and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. "I would just sit there and study Floyd ... I studied how he phrased his songs, how he got the words out, and how the other guys sang along with him", Gregg would later recall.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=46}} They later formed their first "real" band, the Escorts, which performed a mix of [[top 40]] and R&B music at clubs around town.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=49}} Duane, who took the lead vocal role on early demos, encouraged his younger brother to sing instead.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=21}} He and Duane often spent all of their money on records, as they attempted to learn songs from them. The group performed constantly as music became their entire focus; Gregg missed his high school graduation because he was performing that evening.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=50}} In his autobiography, Gregg recalls listening to Nashville R&B station [[WLAC]] at night and discovering artists such as [[Muddy Waters]], who later became central to his musical evolution.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=63}} He avoided being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]] by intentionally shooting himself in the foot.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=61}}

The Escorts evolved into [[the Allman Joys]], the brothers' first successful band. After a successful summer run locally, they hit the road in fall 1965 for a series of performances throughout the Southeast; their first show outside Daytona was at the Stork Club in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama, where they were booked for 22 weeks straight.<ref name="AL12">{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2012/12/mobile_holds_memories_for_greg.html|title=Mobile holds memories for Gregg Allman, who plays Saenger Dec. 30|date=December 18, 2012|first=Lawrence|last=Specker|work=[[Press-Register]]|publisher=[[AL.com]]|access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref> Afterwards, they were booked at the Sahara Club in nearby [[Pensacola]], Florida, for several weeks.<ref name="PS09">{{cite news|url=http://www.pnj.com/article/20091101/LIFE/911010302|title='Florida Rocks Again!'|date=November 1, 2009|first= Troy|last= Moon |work=[[Pensacola News Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205222427/http://www.pnj.com/article/20091101/LIFE/911010302|archive-date=December 5, 2009}}</ref> Allman later regarded Pensacola as "a real turning point in my life", as it was where he learned how to capture audiences and about stage presence.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=66}} He also received his first [[Vox Continental|Vox keyboard]] there, and learned how to play it over the ensuing tour.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=70}} By the following summer, they were able to book time at a studio in Nashville, where they recorded several songs, aided by a plethora of drugs. These recordings were later released as ''Early Allman'' in 1973, to Allman's dismay.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=72}} He soon grew tired of performing covers and began writing original compositions.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=73}} They settled in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] for a time, where in the spring of 1967 they began performing alongside Johnny Sandlin and [[Paul Hornsby]], among others, under various names. They considered disbanding, but Bill McEuen, manager of the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], convinced the band to relocate to Los Angeles, giving them the funds to do so.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=77}}

He arranged a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] in June 1967,{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=41}} and they began to record an album under the new name the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], suggested by their producer, Dallas Smith. Recording was a difficult experience; "the music had no life to it—it was poppy, preprogrammed shit", Allman felt.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} Though they considered themselves [[sellouts]], they needed money to live.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} At concerts, they declined to play anything off their [[Hour Glass (Hour Glass album)|debut album]], released that October, instead opting to play the blues.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=91}} Such gigs were sparse, however, as Liberty only allowed one performance per month.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=83}} After some personnel changes, they recorded their second album, ''[[Power of Love (Hour Glass album)|Power of Love]]'', released in March 1968. It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to [[Non-compete clause|freeze the band]], so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album. The rest of the band mocked Allman, viewing him as too scared to leave and return to the South.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Meanwhile, Duane began doing session work at [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], where he began putting together a new band. He phoned his brother with the proposition of joining the new band—which would have two guitarists and two drummers. With his deal at Liberty fulfilled, he drove to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in March 1969 to jam with the new band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=109}} He called the birth of the group "one of the finer days in my life ... I was starting to feel like I belonged to something again."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=110}}

=== Formation, touring, and Duane's death (1969–1971) ===
The Allman Brothers Band moved to [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], Georgia,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=32}} and forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming [[psychedelic drugs]], and hanging out in [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]], where they would write songs and more—"I'd be lying if I said I didn't have my way with a lady or two down there", said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}}{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=127}} In addition to Gregg, the band included Duane, [[Dickey Betts]] on guitar, [[Berry Oakley]] on bass, and [[Jaimoe]] and [[Butch Trucks]] on drums.<ref name="AM"/> The group remade blues numbers like "[[Trouble No More]]" and "[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]", in addition to improvising jams.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=41}} Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band's main songwriter, composing songs such as "Whipping Post" and "Midnight Rider".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=42}} The group's [[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in November 1969 through [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]],<ref>{{cite book|last      = Freeman|first     = Scott|title     = Midnight Riders: The Story of the Allman Brothers Band|year      = 1996|publisher = Little, Brown and Company|isbn      = 978-0316294522|page=59}}</ref> but suffered from poor sales.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=64}} The band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road,{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}} which contributed to a larger following.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} Their second record, ''[[Idlewild South]]'',{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} was issued in September 1970, and also received a muted commercial response.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}}
[[File:Duane Allman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Allman's elder brother [[Duane Allman|Duane]], who was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1971]]

Their fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, where the band's average earnings doubled.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=115}} "We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album", said Gregg.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} ''At Fillmore East'', recorded at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York City, was released in July 1971.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=124}} ''At Fillmore East'' peaked at number thirteen on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top Pop Albums]] chart, and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with addiction to numerous drugs; they all agreed to quit heroin, but [[cocaine]] remained a problem.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=147}} His last conversation with Duane was an argument over cocaine: Gregg took some of his brother's supply, and later denied it when accused. In his memoir, ''My Cross to Bear'', Gregg wrote: "I have thought of that lie every day of my life ... told him that lie, and he told me that he was sorry and that he loved me."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=193}}

Duane was killed in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, in Macon.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} At his funeral, Gregg performed "Melissa", which was his brother's favorite song.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=196}} "I tried to play and I tried to sing, but I didn't do too much writing. In the days and weeks that followed, ... I wondered if I'd ever find the passion, the energy, the love of making music", he remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=197}} As the band took some time apart to process their loss, ''At Fillmore East'' became a major success domestically. "What we had been trying to do for all those years finally happened, and he was gone," Gregg remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=198}} He later expanded upon his brother's passing in his memoir:

{{blockquote|When I got over being angry, I prayed to him to forgive me, and I realized that my brother had a blast. ... Not that I got over it—I still ain't gotten over it. I don't know what getting over it means, really. I don't stand around crying anymore, but I think about him every day of my life. ... Maybe a lot of learning how to grieve was that I had to grow up a little bit and realize that death is part of life. Now I can talk to my brother in the morning, and he answers me at night. I've opened myself to his death and accepted it, and I think that's the grieving process at work.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=200–02}}}}

=== Mainstream success and fame (1972–1976) ===
After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=162}} They completed their third studio album, ''[[Eat a Peach]]'', that winter, which raised each member's spirits: "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing ''Eat a Peach''", said Allman.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=204}} ''Eat a Peach'' was released the following February, and it became the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on ''Billboard''{{'s}} album chart.<ref name="AM" /> "We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever", Allman recalled.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=210}} The band purchased 432 acres of land in [[Juliette, Georgia]], which became a group hangout.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=175}} Berry Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of his friend,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=185}} and in November 1972 he too was killed in a motorcycle crash.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=189}} "Upset as I was, I kind of breathed a sigh of relief, because Berry's pain was finally over", Allman said.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=210}}
{{listen|filename=Gregg Allman - Queen of Hearts.ogg |title="Queen of Hearts"|description="Queen of Hearts" led Allman to record his first solo album, ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' (1973).|format=[[Ogg]]||pos=left}}
The band unanimously decided to carry on, and enlisted [[Lamar Williams]] on bass and [[Chuck Leavell]] on piano. The band began recording ''Brothers and Sisters'', their follow-up album, and Betts became the group's ''de facto'' leader during the recording process.<ref name="AM.1" /> Meanwhile, after some internal disagreements, Allman began recording a solo album, which he titled ''Laid Back''. The sessions for both albums often overlapped and its creation caused tension within the rest of the band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=216}} Both albums were released in late 1973, with ''Brothers and Sisters'' cementing the Allman Brothers' place among the biggest rock bands of the 1970s.

Privately, the group was dealing with miscommunication and spiraling drug problems.<ref name="AM" />{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=211}} In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting [[the Starship]], a customized [[Boeing 720]]B used by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=230}} "When [we] got that goddamn plane, it was the beginning of the end", said Allman.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=261}}

Band member relationships became increasingly frustrated, amplified by heavy drug and alcohol abuse.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=244}} In January 1975, Allman began a relationship with pop star Cher—which made him more "[[famous for being famous]] than for his music", according to biographer Alan Paul.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=234}} The sessions that produced 1975's ''[[Win, Lose or Draw (album)|Win, Lose or Draw]]'', the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=253}} Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were "embarrassed" by the album.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=236}} Though their relationships were fraying, the Allman Brothers Band went on tour for some of the biggest crowds of their career.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=262}} Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] as the only real "high point" in an otherwise "rough, rough tour".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=268}} The "breaking point" came when Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring, who was arrested and soon convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.<ref name="AM" /> Bandmates considered Allman a "snitch", and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} Herring received a 75-year prison sentence, but he only served eighteen months.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} The band refused to communicate with Allman after the ordeal and finally broke up.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in [[Sea Level (band)|Sea Level]], Betts formed [[Great Southern (band)|Great Southern]], and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}}

The Allman Brothers Band reunited in 1978.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=284}} Allman remembered that each member had his own reasons for rejoining, though he surmised it was a combination of displeasure with how things ended, missing each other, and a need for money.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=285}} The band's reunion album, ''[[Enlightened Rogues]]'', was released in February 1979 and was a mild commercial success.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=246}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} and led the band to sign with [[Arista Records|Arista]], who pushed the band to "modernize" their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly for Betts and Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=251}} The band again grew apart, replacing Jaimoe with new guitarist [[Dan Toler]]'s brother Frankie.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} The band considered their post-reunion albums—''[[Reach for the Sky (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' (1980) and ''[[Brothers of the Road (album)|Brothers of the Road]]'' (1981)—"embarrassing", and subsequently broke up in 1982. "It was like a whole different band made those records ... In truth, though, I was just too drunk most of the time to care one way or the other", Allman would recall.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=295–96}}

=== Downtime, a surprise hit, and another reformation (1982–1990) ===
{{quote box
 |quote  = No two ways about it, the '80s were rough. ... It was seven years of going, 'What is it that I do?' Being self-employed your whole life, that becomes a certain rock, a reinforcement.

Allman spent much of the 1980s adrift and living in [[Sarasota, Florida]] with friends.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=302}} His alcohol abuse was at one of its worst points, with Allman consuming "a minimum of a fifth of [[vodka]] a day."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=296}} He felt the local police pursued him heavily; during this time, he was arrested and charged with a [[DUI]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=304}} While he did not consider himself "washed up", he noted in his autobiography that he kept a "fear of everybody forgetting about you."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=304}} Southern rock had faded from view and [[electronic music]] formed much of the pop music of the decade. "There was hardly anybody playing live music, and those who did were doing it for not much money, in front of some die-hard old [[hippies]] in real small clubs", he later recalled.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=298}} Nevertheless, he reformed the Gregg Allman Band and toured nationwide.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=303}} At one point, he attempted to reconnect with his children, though, according to him, "it just wasn't a good situation".{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=300}}

By 1986, having grown tired of financial instability, Allman approached Betts for a co-headlining tour, a sort-of Allman Brothers reunion.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=305}} After recording several demos, Allman was offered a recording contract by [[Epic Records]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=306}} His third solo release, ''[[I'm No Angel (album)|I'm No Angel]]'' (1987), sold well; its [[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|title track]] became a surprise hit on radio. Allman released another solo album the following year, ''[[Just Before the Bullets Fly]]'', though it did not sell as well as its predecessor. In the late 1980s, he moved to Los Angeles.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=309}} He married Danielle Galiana in what he dubbed [[midlife crisis]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=309}}<ref name="Thompson2020">{{cite book |editor1-last=Thompson |editor1-first=Clifford |title=Contemporary World Musicians |date=2020 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-93961-8 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVYAEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT58}}</ref> The marriage began with Allman overdosing—"so [it] started off with a bang", he said.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=310}} He dabbled in acting starting in 1989, taking several small parts. His largest (and final) role was criminal Will Gaines in the 1991 crime drama ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]''. Allman greatly enjoyed the experience: "It was a different facet of the entertainment industry, and I wanted to see how those people worked together."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=323}} The Allman Brothers Band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989, and the band reunited once more for a summer tour, with Jaimoe again on drums.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} They featured guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] and pianist [[Johnny Neel]], both from the Dickey Betts Band, and bassist [[Allen Woody]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} The band returned to the studio with longtime producer Tom Dowd for 1990's ''[[Seven Turns]]'', which was considered a return to form.<ref name="AM" />{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=277}} "[[Good Clean Fun (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Good Clean Fun]]" and "[[Seven Turns (song)|Seven Turns]]" each became big hits on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. The addition of Haynes and Woody had "reenergized" the ensemble.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=280}}

=== Reforming the band and breaking addictions (1991–2000) ===
The newly reformed Allman Brothers began touring heavily,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=294}} which helped build a new fan base: "We had to build a fan base all over again, but as word of mouth spread about how good the music was, more and more people took notice. It felt great, man, and that really helped the music", Allman recalled.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=317}} Neel left the group and the band added percussionist [[Marc Quiñones]], formerly of [[Spyro Gyra]], the following year.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=290}} They recorded two more studio albums—''[[Shades of Two Worlds]]'' (1992) and ''[[Where It All Begins]]''. In 1993 his youngest daughter Layla Brooklyn Allman was born while Gregg was living in [[Novato, California]]. When his relationship with Shelby Blackburn ended, Layla and Shelby moved back to Los Angeles. Allman's older daughter, Island, came to live with him in Novato, and despite early struggles, they eventually grew very close.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=324}} "Island is the love of my life, she really is", he would later write.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=284}} The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could barely make it through his acceptance speech.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=318}} Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. He hired two in-home nurses that switched twelve-hour shifts to help him through the process.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=330}} He was immensely happy to finally quit alcohol, writing later in his autobiography: "Did I get any positive anything out of all that? And you've got to admit to yourself, no, I didn't. You can see what happened and that by the grace of God, you finally quit before it killed you."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=330}}

For much of the 1990s, Allman lived in [[Marin County, California]], spending his free time with close friends and riding his motorcycle.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=325}} He recorded a fifth solo album, ''[[Searching for Simplicity]]'', which was quietly released on [[550 Music]] in 1997.<ref name="AM.1" /> The album's title reflected his search "for a more simple life" following his rehabilitation from drugs and alcohol.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gregg Allman: Searching for Simplicity|author=Ray Hogan|page=D1–D6|work=Daily Advocate|location=Stamford, Connecticut|date=November 23, 1997}}</ref> Despite positive developments in his personal life, relationships began declining in the band yet again.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=312}} Haynes and Woody left to focus on [[Gov't Mule]], feeling as though a break was imminent.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}} The group recruited [[Oteil Burbridge]] of the [[Col. Bruce Hampton and The Aquarium Rescue Unit|Aquarium Rescue Unit]] to replace Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=326}} Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}} "It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing", said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} Pearson, struggling with [[tinnitus]], left as a result.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=331}} Butch Trucks phoned his nephew, [[Derek Trucks]], to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=342}} All involved contended that the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, which led to a permanent divorce.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} That August, Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}} which hit Allman particularly hard.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=341}} In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}} setting the stage for over a decade of stability within the group.

In ''My Cross to Bear'', Allman reflected on his life and career:

{{blockquote|Music is my life's blood. I love music, I love to play good music, and I love to play music for people who appreciate it. And when it's all said and done, I'll go to my grave and my brother will greet me, saying, "Nice work, little brother—you did alright." I must have said this a million times, but if I died today, I have had me a blast.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=378}}}}

==Musical style and songwriting==
{{listen|filename=Gregg Allman - Midnight Rider.ogg|title="Midnight Rider"|description=Allman's solo rendition of "Midnight Rider" (1973). He considered it his [[signature song]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Allman's style was rooted in rhythm and blues music. He characterized his work with the Allman Brothers Band as "playing some blues with some jazz mixed in."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=181}} He was introduced to blues music through musician and childhood friend Floyd Miles,{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=417}} who later toured with Allman as a part of his solo band.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/floyd-miles-mn0000196076|title=Floyd Miles|author=Jason Ankeny |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref> He also gave him advice on how to sing from his stomach, as opposed to his chest. Allman was inspired by [[Little Milton|"Little Milton" Campbell]], who "inspired me all my life to get my voice crisper, get my diaphragm harder, use less air, and just spit it out. He taught me to be absolutely sure of every note you hit, and to hit it solid."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|pp=47–48}} After his death, many outlets credited Allman as among the greatest white blues vocalists of his time.<ref>Sources crediting Allman as a "white blues singer":

As a songwriter, Allman wrote several famous songs, including "Whipping Post", "Melissa", and "Midnight Rider", which he dubbed the "song I'm most proud of in my career." He could be a very slow songwriter, writing only when inspiration struck. If the song was forced, he felt it could end up contrived. In ''My Cross to Bear'', his 2012 memoir, he laid out his approach to songwriting: the first verse introduces a story, it is expounded upon in the second, and the third may serve as an epilogue.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|pp=152–53}} Allman credited singer-songwriter [[John D. Loudermilk]], whom he first met while touring with the Allman Joys, as an influence on his writing. "[He] taught me to let the song come to me, not to force it, not to put down a word just because it might rhyme or fit. He taught me to let the feeling come from your heart and go to your head."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=68}} Allman received the Songwriter Award from the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in the last year of his life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/22/drivin-n-cryin-gregg-allman-sam-moore-set-to-be-inducted-into-georgia-music-hall-of-fame/|title=Drivin' N' Cryin', Gregg Allman, Sam Moore set to be inducted into Georgia Music Hall of Fame|date=June 3, 2016|author=Melissa Ruggieri|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|access-date=July 5, 2017|archive-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306202343/http://music.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/22/drivin-n-cryin-gregg-allman-sam-moore-set-to-be-inducted-into-georgia-music-hall-of-fame/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In ''My Cross to Bear'', he wrote that "Every woman I've ever had a relationship with has loved me for who they thought I was."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=229}} At the time of its writing, he noted that he only spoke to two out of his then-six ex-wives, including Cher.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=366–67}}

Allman had five children, three with various wives and two with other women he had relationships with:
* son Michael Allman was born on July 3, 1966. He was raised in Daytona Beach, Florida. From his relationship with go-go dancer Mary Lynn Sutton.
* son [[Devon Allman]] (born 1972), lead singer of [[Honeytribe]] and [[The Allman Betts Band]], from his marriage to Shelley Kay Jefts;

Allman was averse to organized religion for many years, but claimed he always believed in a God.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/love-family-drugs-gregg-allman-tells-130822287.html|title=Love, family, drugs: Gregg Allman tells it all|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 7, 2012|access-date=July 13, 2017|first=Chris|last=Talbott|archive-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306143201/https://www.yahoo.com/news/love-family-drugs-gregg-allman-tells-130822287.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following his health ailments in the latter stages of his life, he came around to his own form of Christianity, and began wearing a cross necklace. In his memoir, he stated: "As long as you have spirituality, you're never alone. It's sort of like my mother said all those years ago: now I have my own kind of faith, just like other people. They take what they want of faith, and they leave the rest alone, and I do the same. That's the way it should be." He credited his sixth wife, Stacey Fountain, with helping him increase his faith.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=366–67}}

'''Hiram''' '''King''' "'''Hank'''" '''Williams''' (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter. He is regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century. Williams recorded 55 singles that reached the top 10 of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country & Western Best Sellers chart]], five of which were released posthumously, and 12 of which reached No.1.

Born and raised in Alabama, Williams learned guitar from African-American [[blues]] musician [[Rufus Payne]]. Both Payne and [[Roy Acuff]] significantly influenced his musical style. After winning an amateur talent contest, Williams began his professional career in Montgomery in the late 1930s playing on local radio stations and at area venues such as school houses, movie theaters, and bars. He formed the [[Drifting Cowboys]] backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. Because his alcoholism made him unreliable, he was fired and rehired several times by radio station [[WSFA]], and had trouble replacing several of his band members who were drafted during World War II.

In 1944, Williams married [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]], who competed with his mother to control his career. After recording "Never Again" and "[[Honky Tonkin']]{{-"}} with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]], he signed a contract with [[MGM Records]]. He released the hit single "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It On Over]]" in 1947 and joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' radio program. The next year he released a cover of "[[Lovesick Blues]]", which quickly reached number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} Top Country & Western singles chart and propelled him to stardom on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Although unable to read or [[musical notation|notate music]] to any significant degree, he wrote such iconic hits as "[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]", "[[Hey, Good Lookin' (song)|Hey, Good Lookin']]{{-"}}, and "[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]". In 1952, Audrey<!--She took the surname Williams after her marriage, thus, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Biography#People_with_the_same_surname, is referred to as "Audrey" from now on.--> divorced him and he married [[Billie Jean Horton]]. He was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcoholism.

Years of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely compromised Williams's health, and at the age of 29, Williams suffered from heart failure and [[Death of Hank Williams|died unexpectedly]] in the back seat of a car near [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]], en route to a concert in [[Canton, Ohio]], on New Year's Day 1953. Despite his relatively brief career, he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in [[country music]]. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced [[Chuck Berry]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[the Rolling Stones]], among others. He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1961, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Native American Music Awards]] Hall of Fame in 1999, and gained a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 2010, he was posthumously awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citation]] for his "craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life."

==Early life==

Hank Williams was born Hiram Williams on September 17, 1923, in the rural community of Mount Olive in [[Butler County, Alabama]].{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=6}} He was the third child of Jessie Lillybelle "Lillie" (née Skipper; 1898–1955) and Elonzo Huble "Lon" Williams (1891–1970).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=4-6}} Williams was of [[English American|English ancestry]] and [[Welsh American|Welsh ancestry]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://birthplaceofwesternswing.com/williams.html#:~:text=Williams%20was%20born%20in%20Butler,Smith%20lumber%20company | title=Cowtown Birthplace of Western Swing - Hank Williams }}</ref><ref name="Breverton2009">{{cite book |last1=Breverton |first1=Terry |title=Wales: A Historical Companion |year=2009 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1-4456-0990-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2qoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.abctales.com/story/carl-halling/luke-drifter-and-secrets-country | title=Luke the Drifter and the Secrets of Country &#124; ABCtales }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://birthplaceofwesternswing.com/williams.html#:~:text=Williams%20was%20born%20in%20Butler,he%20was%20of%20English%20ancestry | title=Cowtown Birthplace of Western Swing - Hank Williams }}</ref><ref name="Ribowsky">{{cite book |last1=Ribowsky |first1=Mark |title=Hank: The Short Life and Long Country Road of Hank Williams |year=2016 |publisher=Liveright Publishing |isbn=978-1-63149-158-0 |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeOaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT15}}</ref>  Elonzo's family came from south and central Alabama,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=5}} and his father fought during the [[American Civil War]], first on the Confederate side, and then with the Union after he was captured.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=15}} Elonzo was a [[railroad engineer]] for the W. T. Smith lumber company and was drafted during [[World War I]], serving from July 1918 to June 1919. He suffered severe injuries after falling from a truck, breaking his collarbone, and receiving a severe blow to the head.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=4-6}}

The Williams' first child, Ernest Huble Williams, died two days after his birth on July 5, 1921. A daughter, Irene, was born a year later. Williams was named after [[Hiram I]] of the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=3}} His name was misspelled as "Hiriam" on his birth certificate, which was prepared and signed when he was 10 years old.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=6–7}}  Williams was born with [[spina bifida occulta]], a birth defect of the [[spinal column]] that caused him lifelong pain and became a major factor in his later alcohol and drug abuse.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=10}} At the age of three, Williams sat with his mother as she played the organ at the Mount Olive Baptist Church. Lillie also joined singing the hymns that influenced the singer's later compositions. Williams received his first musical instrument, a harmonica, at the age of six.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=11}} As a child, he was nicknamed "Harm" by his family and "Herky" or "Skeets" by his friends.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=7}}

Williams's father frequently relocated for work, and as a result the family lived in several southern Alabama towns. In 1930, when Williams was seven years old, Elonzo began experiencing facial [[paralysis]]. After being evaluated at a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] clinic in [[Pensacola, Florida]], doctors determined that he had a [[brain aneurysm]], and Elonzo was sent to the VA Medical Center in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=9}} He remained hospitalized for eight years and was mostly absent throughout Williams's childhood. From that point on, Lillie assumed responsibility for the family.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=8-10}}

In the fall of 1933, Williams was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Walter and Alice McNeil, in Fountain, Alabama. Their daughter, Opal, went in exchange to live with Lillie to attend school in [[Georgiana, Alabama]]. Williams learned to play basic guitar chords from his aunt and listened to music that was played at dances and in area churches.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=18-21}} The following year, the Williams family moved to [[Greenville, Alabama]], where Lillie opened a [[boarding house]] next to the local [[cotton gin]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=13-14}} The family later returned with Opal McNeil to Georgiana, where Lillie took several side jobs to support the family despite the bleak economic climate of the [[Great Depression]]. She worked in a [[cannery]] and served as a night-shift nurse in the local hospital. Their first house burned down, and the family lost their possessions. They moved to Rose Street on the other side of town, into a house which Williams's mother soon turned into another boarding house. The house had a small garden in which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=10-14}} At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Williams's sister Irene met U.S. Representative [[J. Lister Hill]] while Hill was campaigning across Alabama. She told Hill that her mother was interested in talking to him about her problems. With Hill's help, the family began collecting Elonzo's [[disability pension]].{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=27}} Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=16-17}}

There are several versions of how Williams got his first guitar. While several prominent Georgiana residents later claimed to have bought it for him, his mother said she bought it for him and that she arranged for his first lessons.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=20}} Williams told [[Ralph Gleason]], who at the time was writing a weekly music column in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "When I was about eight years old, I got my first git-tar. A second-hand $3.50 git-tar my mother bought me."{{sfn|Betts, Stephen L.|2019}} Gawky and shy, Williams attached himself to an old black man, [[Rufus Payne|Rufus "Tee-Tot" Payne]], a street performer whom Williams followed around town. Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for money or meals prepared by Lillie.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=20-26}} Payne's basic musical style was [[blues]]; he repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining good rhythm and time,{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=12}} and he added the showmanship of stoops, bows, laughs and cries to his performances.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=23}} Later on, Williams recorded "[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]", one of the songs Payne had taught him.{{sfn|Brackett, David|p=98|2000}} Williams was also influenced by country acts such as [[Roy Acuff]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=21-23}} In 1937, Williams got into a fight with his physical education teacher about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama]].{{sfn|Masino, Susan|2011|p=11}} Payne and Williams lost touch, though Payne also eventually moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=229}} Williams later credited him as the provider of the only musical training he ever had.{{sfn|Rankin, Allen|1951|p=3C}}

==Career==
===1930s===
[[File:HankWilliams1938-Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams performing in Montgomery in 1938]]

In July 1937, the Williams and McNeils opened a [[boarding house]] on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It was at this time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=19-21}} During the same year, he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater and won the first prize of US$15 ({{Inflation|US|15|1937|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) singing his first original song "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of [[Riley Puckett]]'s "Dissatisfied".{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=16}}

He never learned to read music; instead he based his compositions in storytelling and personal experience.{{sfn|Rankin, Allen|1951|p=3C}}
After school and on weekends, Williams sang and played his [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] guitar on the sidewalk in front of the [[WLWI (AM)|WSFA]] radio studio.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=28}} His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air with Dad Crysel's band.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=16-17}}

In August 1938, Elonzo Williams was temporarily released from the hospital. He showed up unannounced at the family's home in Montgomery. Lillie was unwilling to let him reclaim his position as the head of the household. Elonzo stayed to celebrate his son's birthday in September before he returned to the medical center in Louisiana.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=30}}

Williams's successful radio show fueled his entry into a music career, and he started his own band for show dates, the [[Drifting Cowboys]]. The original members were guitarist Braxton Schuffert, fiddler Freddie Beach, and comedian Smith "Hezzy" Adair.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=20-21}} Originally billed as "Hank and Hezzy and the Drifting Cowboys", they frequently appeared as fill-ins at the local dancehall, Thigpen's Log Cabin, just out of Georgiana.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=37}} The band traveled throughout central and southern Alabama performing in clubs and at private gatherings. James Ellis Garner later played fiddle for him. Lillie Williams became the Drifting Cowboys' manager. Williams dropped out of school in October 1939 so that he and the Drifting Cowboys could work full-time. Lillie Williams began booking show dates, negotiating prices and driving them to some of their shows.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=16-18}} Now free to travel without deference to Williams's schooling, the band could tour as far away as western Georgia and the [[Florida Panhandle]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=24}} The band started playing in theaters before [[film screening|the screening of films]] and later they played in [[honky-tonk]]s. Williams's alcohol use started to become a problem during the tours; on occasion he spent a large part of the show revenues on alcohol. Meanwhile, between tour schedules, Williams returned to Montgomery to host his radio show.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=34-37}}

===1940s===
[[File:Hank Williams Drifting Cowboys Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Williams, Sheppard, and the Drifting Cowboys band in 1951]]
The American entry into [[World War II]] in 1941 marked the beginning of hard times for Williams. While he was [[Selective Training and Service Act|medically disqualified from military service]] after falling from a bull during a [[rodeo]] in Texas and suffering a back injury, his band members were all [[Selective Training and Service Act|drafted]] to serve. Many of their replacements quit the band due to Williams's worsening alcoholism, and in August 1942 WSFA fired him for "habitual drunkenness". Backstage during one of his concerts, Williams met [[Roy Acuff]], who warned him of the dangers of alcohol, saying, "You've got a million-dollar voice, son, but a ten-cent brain."{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=39-40}}

He started a job as a shipfitter's helper for the [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1942,{{sfn|Lipsitz|1994|p=26}} working there off and on for about a year and a half during the war. He also worked briefly at [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in Portland, Oregon, apparently lured by the free tickets, free accommodations, free training, and good wages offered by the company.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=33}} In 1943, Williams met [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]] at a [[medicine show]] in [[Banks, Alabama]]. According to Sheppard, she and Williams lived in a hotel in Mobile while they worked together at the shipyard for a short while.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=34-35, 38-39}} Sheppard told Williams that she wanted to help him regain his radio show, and that they should move to Montgomery and start a band. The couple were married in 1944 at a [[Texaco]] gas station in [[Andalusia, Alabama]], by a justice of the peace. The marriage was technically invalid, since Sheppard's divorce from her previous husband did not comply with the legally required 60-day reconciliation period.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=23-24}}

In 1945, back in Montgomery, Williams returned to WSFA radio. He attempted to expand his repertoire by writing original songs,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=42}} and he published his first songbook, ''Original Songs of Hank Williams'', containing "I'm Not Coming Home Anymore" and several more original songs,{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=41-42}} nine in all, including one not written by him, "A Tramp on the Street".{{sfn|Williams, Hank|1945}} With Williams beginning to be recognized as a songwriter, Sheppard became his manager and occasionally sang and substituted on guitar when a band member did not make the show.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=56-57}}

On September 14, 1946, Williams auditioned for Nashville's [[Grand Ole Opry]] at the recommendation of  [[Ernest Tubb]], but was rejected. After the failure of his audition, Williams and Audrey attempted to interest the recently formed music publishing firm [[Acuff-Rose Music]]. They approached [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]], the president of the company, during one of his daily ping-pong games at WSM radio studios. Audrey asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him at that moment, Rose agreed, and perceived that Williams had much promise as a songwriter.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=58-60}} Rose signed Williams to a six-song contract, and leveraged this deal to sign Williams with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]]. On December 11, 1946, in his first recording session, Williams recorded "Wealth Won't Save Your Soul", "Calling You", "[[Never Again (Will I Knock on Your Door)]]", and "When God Comes and Gathers His Jewels", which was misprinted as "When God Comes and ''Fathers'' His Jewels".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=59-60}} The Sterling releases of Williams's songs became successful, and Rose decided to find a larger label for future releases. The producer then approached the newly formed recording division of the [[Loews Corporation]], [[MGM Records]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=64-65}}
{{Listen |filename=Lovesick Blues Hank Williams.ogg |title=Lovesick Blues |description=A major hit for Hank Williams, "[[Lovesick Blues]]" moved him to the mainstream of country music and assured him a position in the [[Grand Ole Opry]].}}

Williams signed with MGM Records in 1947 and released "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]", which became a country hit.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=66-67}} In 1948, he moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', a radio show broadcast on [[KWKH]] that brought him into living rooms all over the Southeastern United States, appearing in weekend shows. As part of the arrangement, Williams got a program on the station and bookings through the ''Hayride''{{'s}} artist service to perform across western Louisiana and eastern Texas, always returning on Saturdays for the show's weekly broadcast.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=69-71}} After a few more moderate hits, in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Irving Mills]] song "[[Lovesick Blues]]", made popular by [[Rex Griffin]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=98-99}} Williams's version was a hit; the song stayed at number one on the ''Billboard'' charts for four consecutive months.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=100}} Following the success of the releases of "Lovesick Blues" and "[[Wedding Bells (Hank Williams song)|Wedding Bells]]", Williams signed a management contract with Oscar Davis. Davis then booked the singer on a ''Grand Ole Opry'' package show, and he later negotiated Williams's induction into the musical troupe.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=109, 113, 116}}

On June 11, 1949, Williams made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry, where he received six [[encore]]s.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=41-42}} He brought together Bob McNett (guitar), [[Hillous Butrum]] ([[Double bass|bass]]), [[Jerry Rivers]] ([[fiddle]]) and [[Don Helms]] ([[steel guitar]]) to form the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=46-50}} That year Audrey Williams gave birth to Randall Hank Williams ([[Hank Williams Jr.]]).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=43}} During 1949, he joined the Grand Ole Opry's first European tour, performing in military bases in Germany and Austria.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=131}} Williams had five songs that ranked in the top five ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles that year including:  "Wedding Bells", "[[Mind Your Own Business]]", "[[You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)]]", "[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]", and "Lovesick Blues", which reached No. 1.{{sfn|Young, William H.|Young, Nancy K.|2010|p=235}}

===1950s===
By 1950, Williams earned an estimated $1,000 per show ({{Inflation|US|1000|1950|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=50}} That year, he began recording as "Luke the Drifter" for his moral-themed songs, many of which are recitations rather than singing. Fred Rose had been concerned how it would affect the jukebox operators who serviced the machines at the honky-tonks where William's songs were most commonly played if a customer punched a "Hank Williams" selection on a jukebox and heard a sermon rather than the music expected. It was he who requested that Hank use a pseudonym for these recitations to avoid leading people astray.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=117-118}} Although the real identity of Luke the Drifter was supposed to be unknown, Williams often performed part of the recorded material on stage. Most of the material was written by Williams himself, although Fred Rose wrote at least one piece, and others, according to his son [[Wesley Rose|Wesley]], were collaborations between Williams, Rose, and himself.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=129}} The songs depicted Luke the Drifter traveling around from place to place, narrating stories of different characters{{sfn|Hurd, Mary G.|2015|p=12}} and philosophizing about relationships gone awry, injustice in society, and death.{{sfn|Wilmeth|2014|p=250}} Performances of the compositions included only Williams's voice, an organ, a [[Double bass|bass fiddle]], and Helms' steel guitar.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=118}}

Around this time Williams released more hit songs, such as "[[My Son Calls Another Man Daddy]]", "[[Why Should We Try Anymore]]", "[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]", "[[Why Don't You Love Me (Hank Williams song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]", and "[[I Just Don't Like This Kind of Living|I Just Don't Like This Kind of Livin']]".{{sfn|Billboard staff|1951|p=19}} In 1951, "[[Dear John (Hank Williams song)|Dear John]]" became a hit, but it was the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]", that became one of his most recognized songs.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=155-159}} A pop cover version by [[Tony Bennett]] released the same year stayed on the charts for 27 weeks, peaking at number one.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|p=26|1991}}

{{Listen |filename=Beyond The Sunset Hank Williams.ogg |title=Beyond the Sunset |description=One characteristic of Williams's recordings as "Luke the Drifter" is the use of narration rather than singing.}}
Williams's career reached a peak in the late summer of 1951 with his [[Hadacol]] tour of the U.S. with [[Bob Hope]] and other actors. On the weekend after the tour ended, Williams was photographed backstage at the Grand Ole Opry signing a motion picture deal with [[MGM]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=190}} In October, Williams recorded a demo, "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]" for a friend, "[[Big Bill Lister]]", who had recorded "Beer Drinking Blues", a beer drinking song that sold well, and needed another one. The session was recorded by the head of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for [[Capitol Records]], [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. Afterwards Lister stored the demo acetate, with no markings, in a box of records kept at his house, and then when he moved, in his yard under a tarp for several years. He eventually gave the acetate to Hank Williams, Jr., who had a hit with it and an accompanying video which depicted the son playing with his father in an overdubbed dream sequence.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=180–181}} The following month, MGM Records released Williams's debut album, ''[[Hank Williams Sings]]''. On November 14, 1951, Williams drove with Bill Lister and the Drifting Cowboys to New York where he appeared on television for the first time with [[Perry Como]] on CBS's ''[[Perry Como television and radio shows|Perry Como Show]]''.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=191}} There he sang "Hey Good Lookin'", and the next week Como opened the show wearing a cowboy hat and singing the same song, with apologies to Williams.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=191–193}}

On May 21, 1951, Williams was admitted to North Louisiana Sanitarium in Shreveport for treatment of his alcoholism and his back problem, and was released on May 24.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=153, 154}} In November of the same year, he fell trying to leap across a gully on a squirrel hunting trip with his fiddler Jerry Rivers in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. The fall aggravated his congenital spinal condition, {{sfn|Koon, George William|p=63|2001}} and on December 13, 1951, he underwent a [[spinal fusion]] at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center|Vanderbilt University Hospital]]. He was discharged against medical advice on Christmas Eve wearing a back brace and consuming more painkillers, to the detriment of his already compromised health.{{sfn|Koon, George William|pp=63, 153–154|2001}}

[[File:HankWilliams1951concert.jpg|thumb|Williams performing in 1951|left|upright=0.9]]

In the spring of 1952, Williams flew to New York City twice with his band and a Grand Ole Opry troupe to appear on two episodes of the nationally broadcast ''[[Kate Smith|The Kate Smith Evening Hour]]''.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=209, 211}} On March 26, he performed "[[Hey Good Lookin' (song)|Hey Good Lookin']]" and joined the rest of the cast in singing "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]".{{sfn|CMHoF|2023a}} On April 23, he performed "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]" and sang a truncated "[[I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)]]" with [[Anita Carter]], and later joined the cast in singing "Glory Bound Train".{{sfn|CMHoF|2023b}} During the same year, Williams had a brief extramarital affair with dancer Bobbie Jett, resulting in the birth of their daughter, [[Jett Williams]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=209, 226-227}}

In June 1952, he recorded "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]", "[[Window Shopping (song)|Window Shopping]]", "[[Settin' the Woods on Fire]]", and "[[I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive]]". Audrey Williams divorced him that year; the next day he recorded "[[You Win Again (Hank Williams song)|You Win Again]]" and "[[I Won't Be Home No More]]".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=213-216}} Around this time, he met [[Billie Jean Horton|Billie Jean Jones]], a girlfriend of country singer [[Faron Young]], at the Grand Ole Opry. As a girl, Jones had lived down the street from Williams when he was with the Louisiana Hayride, and now Williams began to visit her frequently in Shreveport, causing him to miss many Grand Ole Opry appearances.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=201-204}}

On August 11, 1952, Williams was dismissed from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport to perform on [[KWKH]] and [[WBAM]] shows and in the ''Louisiana Hayride'', for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but despite the efforts of his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=197-199}} In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=70}}

During his last recording session on September 23, 1952, Williams recorded "[[Kaw-Liga (song)|Kaw-Liga]]", along with "[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]", "[[Take These Chains from My Heart]]", and "[[I Could Never Be Ashamed of You]]". By the end of 1952, Williams started to have heart problems.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=67}} He met Horace "Toby" Marshall in [[Oklahoma City]], who said that he was a doctor. Marshall had been previously convicted for forgery, and had been paroled and released from the [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]] in 1951. Among other fake titles, he said that he was a [[Doctor of Science]]. He purchased the DSC title for $25 from the ''Chicago School of Applied Science''; in the diploma, he requested that the DSc be spelled out as "Doctor of Science and Psychology". Under the name of Dr. C. W. Lemon he prescribed Williams with [[amphetamines]], [[Seconal]], [[chloral hydrate]], and [[morphine]], which made his heart problems worse.{{sfn|Koon, George William|p=74|2001}} The final concert of his 1952 tour was held in Austin, Texas, at the Skyline Club on December 19.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=255–256}} Williams's last known public performance took place in Montgomery, on December 21, where he sang at a benefit held by the local chapter of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] for a radio announcer who had polio.{{sfn|Koon, George William|p=75, 154|2001}}{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=212}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Hank and Audrey Williams MGM publicity - Cropped.jpeg|thumb|upright|Williams and his first wife [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]] in a publicity photo for [[MGM Records]], c. 1952]]
On December 15, 1944, Williams married [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]].<!--She took the surname Williams after her marriage, thus, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Biography#People_with_the_same_surname, is referred to by name as "Audrey" to distinguish her from "Hank".--> It was her second marriage and his first.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=22-24}} Their son, Randall Hank Williams (now known as [[Hank Williams Jr.]]), was born on May 26, 1949.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=40}} The marriage was always turbulent and rapidly disintegrated,{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=26, 36-38}} and Williams developed serious problems with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his [[spina bifida occulta]].{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=9-10}} The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=96}}

In June 1952, Williams moved into a house on the corner of Natchez Trace and Westwood Avenue in Nashville, sharing it with singer [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=202}}{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=193}} Price left soon after due to Williams's alcoholism.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=195}} Following an unsuccessful tour of California and several stints in a sanitorium, Williams moved to his mother's boardinghouse by September.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=65-67}} A relationship with a woman named Bobbie Jett during this period resulted in a daughter, [[Jett Williams]], who was born five days after Williams died.
His mother adopted Jett, who became a ward of the state after her grandmother's death. She was adopted and raised by an unrelated couple and did not learn that she was Williams's daughter until the early 1980s.{{sfn|Williams, Hilary|Roberts, Mary Beth|p=127|2010}}

On October 18, 1952, Williams and [[Billie Jean Jones]] were married by a justice of the peace in [[Minden, Louisiana]]. The next day, two public marriage ceremonies were held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=68–70}} After Williams's death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones' divorce had not become final until 11 days after she married Williams. His first wife and his mother were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid, and they pursued the matter for years.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=233–236}}

A man named Lewis Fitzgerald (born 1943) claimed to be Williams's illegitimate son; he was the son of Marie McNeil, Williams's cousin. Fitzgerald was interviewed, and he suggested that Lillie Williams operated a brothel at her boarding house in Montgomery. A friend of the family denied his claims, but singer [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] claimed that Williams mentioned to him the presence of men in the house who were led upstairs.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=43}}

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Hank Williams}}
Williams was scheduled to perform at the [[Charleston Municipal Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], on New Years Eve, December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled $3,000.{{sfn|Lilly, John|2002|pp=64-65}} That day, Williams could not fly because of a snow storm in the Montgomery area; he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=213}} On December 30, Williams and Carr stopped at the [[Redmont Hotel]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The following morning, they continued to [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]], and then to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Williams and his driver then took a flight to Charleston, but the plane returned to Knoxville due to bad weather.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=265-266}} Back in Knoxville, the two arrived at the [[Andrew Johnson Building|Andrew Johnson Hotel]], and Carr requested a doctor for Williams, who was affected by the combination of the [[chloral hydrate]] and alcohol he had consumed on the way to Knoxville.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|p=295}} Dr. P. H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] that also contained a quarter-grain of [[morphine]]. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel, but the porters had to carry Williams to the car. Carr later mentioned that Williams had severe hiccups, while the porters said that he had made a coughing sound twice.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|pp=296-298}} Carr spoke with Toby Marshall on the phone, who informed him on behalf of the tour's promoter, A.V. Bamford, that the show in Charleston was cancelled and he ordered him instead to drive Williams to [[Canton, Ohio]], for a New Year's Day concert there.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=267}}

[[File:Hank Williams Memorial Montgomery Alabama.JPG|right|thumb|Entrance marker of the Oakwood Annex Cemetery in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]]]
Around midnight on January 1, 1953, the two crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in [[Bristol, Virginia]]. Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked for a relief driver from a local taxi company, as he felt exhausted after driving for 20 hours. Driver Don Surface left the restaurant with Carr and Williams. They drove on until they stopped for fuel and coffee at a gas station in [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]], where they realized that Williams had been dead for so long that [[rigor mortis]] had already set in. The station's owner called the local police chief.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=268–270}} Dr. Ivan Malinin performed the [[autopsy]] at the Tyree Funeral House.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=271}} He found hemorrhages in the heart and neck and pronounced the cause of death as "acute rt. ventricular dilation".{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=78}} He also wrote that Williams had been severely beaten and kicked in the groin recently (during a fight in a Montgomery bar a few days earlier), and local magistrate Virgil F. Lyons ordered an inquest into Williams's death concerning a welt that was visible on his head.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=271}} That evening in Canton, when Williams's death was announced to the gathered crowd, a few people started laughing because they thought it was a joke. Akron deejay Cliff Rodgers assured the crowd that it was no joke and that Hank Williams was indeed dead. When [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]] and other performers started singing Williams's song "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]" as a tribute to him, the crowd began to sing along.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=275–276}}

On January 2, Williams's body was transported to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], where it was placed in a silver casket that was displayed at his mother's boarding house for two days. His funeral took place on January 4 at the Montgomery Auditorium, with his casket placed on the flower-covered stage.  Mourners came to Montgomery from all over the South, and beyond.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=223–224}} An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 people were outside the auditorium, and inside were 2,750, with the balcony set aside for about 200 black mourners. Hundreds passed by the casket.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=276–280}} Backed by the Drifting Cowboys, Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb and [[Red Foley]] performed "I Saw the Light", "[[Beyond the Sunset (song)|Beyond the Sunset]]" and "[[Peace in the Valley]]".{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=190}}  Williams's remains are interred at the [[Oakwood Cemetery (Montgomery, Alabama)|Oakwood Annex]] in Montgomery.{{sfn|Peterson, Richard A.|1997|p=182}}

In late January 1953, [[MGM Records]] told ''Billboard'' magazine that the label had to reduce their planned releases for the month from 12 records to 6 to satisfy the demand for Williams's music. The label estimated that the amount of back orders of his records, and those by other artists would cover the production of their [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]], pressing plant until April 1953. Meanwhile, MGM Records received 3,000 direct requests for pictures of the singer, that combined with the requests from the distributors made the company outsource their printing and shipment. According to Acuff-Rose Music, the sales from the two Williams song folios jumped from their average of 700 per week to 5,000 in three weeks.{{sfn|Billboard staff|1953a|p=15}}

Williams's final single, released in November 1952 while he was still alive, was titled "[[I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive]]". His song "Your Cheatin' Heart" was written and recorded in September 1952, but released in late January 1953 after his death. The song, backed by "[[Kaw-Liga]]", was No. 1 on the country charts for six weeks.  "Take These Chains From My Heart" was released in April 1953 and reached No. 1 on the country charts.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=199}}{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=288-289}} Released in July, "I Won't Be Home No More" went to No. 4.

The [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] stressed that Williams "set the agenda for contemporary country songcraft" and the "standard by which success is measured in country music".{{sfn|CMHoF|2023c}} ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' considers him "country music's first superstar" and an "immensely talented songwriter and an impassioned vocalist".{{sfn|Wallenfeldt, Jeff|2023}} The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] praised the "straightforward approach" of Williams's songs, which they deemed "brutally honest" and written in the "language of the everyman".{{sfn|RockHall|2023}} To [[AllMusic]], Williams "established the rules for all the country performers who followed him and, in the process, much of popular music".{{sfn|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|2013}}

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} TV critic, Ken Tucker, wrote: "despite being a pop-culture titan and rightly dubbed "father of country music", Hank Williams was possibly the least likable — least warm and sympathetic — figure in modern music. Reeking of self-pity, he wrote and sang some of the greatest woe-is-me music of the century [...] Brimming with an anger that regularly spilled over into misogyny, Williams was also a master of spite".{{sfn|Tucker, Ken|1998}} Hank Williams, Jr. wrote in his autobiography: "To hear the tributes, one would think that the entire city [Nashville] took turns kissing Daddy while he was still alive. [...] While he was alive, he was despised and envied; after he died, he was some kind of saint."{{sfn|Williams|Bane|1979|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o_Y5AQAAIAAJ&q=%22kissing%20Daddy%22 64]}}

Alabama governor [[Gordon Persons]] officially proclaimed September 21 "Hank Williams Day".{{sfn|Outlook staff|1954|p=1}} The first celebration, in 1954, featured the unveiling of a monument at the [[Cramton Bowl]] that was later placed at the gravesite of Williams.

Several of Williams's descendants became musicians: son Hank Williams Jr., daughter [[Jett Williams]], grandsons [[Hank Williams III]] and Sam Williams, and granddaughters Hilary Williams and [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]] are also country musicians.{{sfn|Chiu, David|2010}}{{sfn|AP staff|2008}}{{sfn|Betts, Stephen L.|2018}} In July 2020, his granddaughter Katherine (Hank Jr.'s daughter) died in a car crash at the age of 27.{{sfn|Pasquini, Maria|2020}} His great-grandson Coleman Finchum, son of Hank Williams III, released his debut single credited to IV and the Strange Band in 2021.{{sfn|Harmon, Bryce|2021}} Meanwhile, Lewis Fitzgerald's son Ricky billed himself as Hank Williams IV following his father's claim of being Williams's son.{{sfn|Savingcountrymusic.com|2021}}

According to reportage in the Los Angeles Times, on his road trips Williams carried a brown leather briefcase containing notebooks in which he wrote musings, lines and verses of song lyrics, as well as jottings on whatever had been handy. After he died, the cache of sixty-six unpublished songs in four notebooks was stored in a fireproof vault at the Nashville offices of his publishing firm, Acuff-Rose Publications. The vault was moved in 2002 to the offices of Sony ATV Music when it acquired Acuff-Rose.{{sfn|Lewis, Randy|2011}}

After the 2001 tribute album, "Hank Williams: Timeless" won a Grammy Award for country album of the year, there was heightened interest in similar projects. [[A&R]] executive Mary Martin, one of the producers of "Timeless", was consulted about other means of drawing attention to material from the Williams archive. She said that Bob Dylan was given the first opportunity to perform 12 songs for a CD compilation. Dylan approached Williams's granddaughter Holly Williams at a show where he gave her a sheaf of song lyrics he wanted her to read. She later said that although Dylan had said nothing about them at first, she recognized them immediately as her grandfather's work. He then said he had been asked to possibly cut an entire album, or that he might have other artists perform them. She heard nothing more about it for two years until Mary Martin revived the project and she got a phone call from her publishing company saying it was time for her to pick up some samples of the available material.{{sfn|Talbott, Chris|2011}}

Consequently, several other musicians got involved in the project, their main task being to create music that suited the lyrics. Dylan chose a song called "The Love That Faded" and fashioned a "honky-tonk waltz through heartache", while Holly Williams combed through the songs and songs fragments and chose one called "Blue Is My Heart", which had only eight lines. She wrote two more and added a bridge. The completed album,  named ''[[The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams]]'',  included the contributions of Bob Dylan and Holly Williams, as well as recordings by [[Alan Jackson]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], [[Jakob Dylan]],{{sfn|Lewis, Randy|2011}} [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Levon Helm]], [[Sheryl Crow]], and [[Merle Haggard]]. The album was released on October 4, 2011.

Material recorded by Williams, originally intended for radio broadcasts to be played when he was on tour or for its distribution to radio stations nationwide, resurfaced over the years.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=153–154}} In 1993, a double-disc set of recordings of Williams for the ''Health & Happiness Show'' was released.{{sfn|Hinckley, David|1993|p=58}} Broadcast in 1949, the shows were recorded for the promotion of Hadacol. The set was re-released on ''Hank Williams: The Legend Begins'' in 2011. The album included the unreleased songs "Fan It" and "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]", recorded by Williams at age 15; the homemade recordings of him singing "Freight Train Blues", "[[New San Antonio Rose]]", "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]" and "Greenback Dollar" at age 18; and a recording for the 1951 [[March of Dimes]].{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|2011b}}

In May 2014, further radio recordings by Williams were released. These were recordings of ''[[The Garden Spot Programs, 1950]]'', a series of publicity segments for plant nursery Naughton Farms originally aired in 1950. The recordings were found by collector George Gimarc at radio station [[KSIB (AM)|KSIB]] in [[Creston, Iowa]].{{sfn|Mansfield, Brian|2014}} Gimarc contacted Williams's daughter Jett, and [[Colin Escott]], a music historian and biographer of Williams. The material was restored and remastered by [[Michael Graves (audio engineer)|Michael Graves]] and released by [[Omnivore Recordings]].{{sfn|Vigeland, Tess|2014}}{{sfn|Elliot, Gwendolyn|2014}} The release won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album|Best Historical Album]].{{sfn|Stefano, Angela|2015}}

Williams was portrayed by English actor [[Tom Hiddleston]] in the 2016 biopic ''[[I Saw the Light (film)|I Saw the Light]]'', based on Colin Escott's 1994 book ''Hank Williams: The Biography''.{{sfn|Michaels, Sean|2014}} In 2023, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Williams at No. 30 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2023}} For the 100th anniversary of his birth, the Hank Williams Museum organized a three-day event in Montgomery that consisted of a series of concerts at the Davis Theater at [[Troy University]] and a wreath-laying ceremony at Williams's graveside as the closing event.{{sfn|WSFA|2023}} At the ceremony, September 17, 2023, was proclaimed Hank Williams Day.{{sfn|Avant, Julia|2023}} Meanwhile, in Nashville, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum organized a concert featuring artists including [[Rodney Crowell]] and Williams's grandchildren Holly, Hillary, and Sam among others.{{sfn|Sauter, Danica|2023}} On the anniversary, ''Billboard'' commented that Williams was a "breakthrough songwriter" who "remains a mythological figure".{{sfn|Roland, Tom|2023}}

===Lawsuits over the estate===
Williams died without leaving a will. In May 1953, Audrey Williams filed a lawsuit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit demanded that both of the publishing companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams's records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams left no will, the disposition of the remaining 50 percent was considered uncertain; those involved included Williams's second wife, [[Billie Jean Horton]] and Williams's mother and sister.{{sfn|Billboard staff|1953b|p=15}}

At the time of his death, Williams's estate was estimated to be US$13,329.25 ({{Inflation|US|13329.25|1953|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) between cash, a cashier's check and his possessions.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=233}} Lilly Williams considered the legality of Billie Jean's marriage to her son doubtful and she filed for the control of the estate.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=234}} Billie Jean's lawyer argued that although she married Williams ten days before the finalization of her divorce to Harrison Eshlimar, Louisiana law considered the union legal since she married "in good faith".{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=234-235}}

Doubtful of the legality of the marriage in Tennessee and Alabama, Lilly Williams and her lawyers made several offers to settle out of court with Billie Jean that reached a final of US$30,000.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} On August 19, 1953, Billie Jean signed an agreement accepting the money. It required that she stopped making appearances billing herself as "Mrs. Hank Williams", to reveal the location of Williams's [[Tennessee Walking Horse]], and the return of a saddle and three suitcases that belonged to him. With the agreement, Lilly became the legal guardian of the estate on behalf of Hank Williams, Jr.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=288}}

Soon after giving birth, Bobbie Jett left her and Williams's daughter at Lilly's boardinghouse. Williams's mother expressed to the Montgomery County Department of Public Welfare in January 1953 her intention to adopt the child. While Irene Williams opposed the adoption, Williams's mother was granted the custody over the child she renamed "Cathy".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=285-286}} However, upon Lilly's death in 1955, Irene Williams assumed control of the estate.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} She became thus the legal guardian of Williams's son, while refusing to adopt Cathy. Irene made an attempt to contact the girl's mother, Bobbie Jett, who was at the time married and lived in California. Jett refused to take the child since her husband did not know of the existence of her daughter with Williams.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=289}} Cathy was then put up for adoption and granted money from the estate of Lilly Williams, to be paid at the age of 21.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=290}}

In 1963, Wesley Rose contacted Irene regarding the copyright renewals with Acuff-Rose: Rose offered US$25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1963|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}),{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=85}} which Irene accepted to prevent Williams's daughter from making a claim in the future.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=293}} In 1966, an Alabama judge determined that the guardianship of Williams's estate belonged to Irene Williams, and he confirmed the validity of the copyright renewal deal. Cathy's adoptive parents were contacted by a lawyer, but they refused to contest the ruling of the court.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=294}} In 1967, Hank Williams, Jr. was declared the only heir to the estate by a second judge.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=87}} In 1969, the guardianship of the estate was transferred to lawyer Robert Stewart after Irene was arrested and sentenced to a jail term for possession of cocaine by a Texas court.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} Hank Williams, Jr. reached legal adulthood in 1970.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=293}}

On October 22, 1975, a federal judge in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, ruled that Billie Jean Horton was Williams's common-law wife, and that part of the copyright renewals of the songs belonged to her.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=87}} At the age of 21, Cathy learned that Hank Williams was her biological father. In 1981, she found her half-siblings in California, and she learned of a 1951 contract between her biological parents that recognized her as Williams's daughter. She also learned that the court decisions of the 1960s ignored her existence. After a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]] in 1989, she was recognized as an heir of the estate of Williams. She later changed her name to Jett Williams.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=89-90}}

====WSM's ''Mother's Best Flour''====
In 1951, Williams hosted a 15-minute show for ''Mother's Best Flour'' on WSM radio. Due to Williams's tour schedules, some of the shows were previously recorded to be played in his absence.{{sfn|Hilbourn, Robert|2008}} During the mid-1960s, WSM staff photographer Les Leverett rescued acetates that were thrown away by the station.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}} At a later point, the recordings were duplicated.{{sfn|Ragogna, Mike|2010}} In the 1980s, he shared the acetates with Williams's former band member Jerry Rivers. A decade later, Leverett made a deal with former Drifting Cowboy Hillous Brutum, who did not appear on the recordings, for a commercial release of the copies.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}}

The Legacy Entertainment Group, based in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]], was sued by [[PolyGram]] and the heirs of Williams to block the release in 1997. While the original acetates of the shows made their way to the possession of Jett Williams, the lawyer of Legacy Entertainment Group claimed that they belonged to the label and he made an attempt to prevent the heirs of Williams to work on their own release of the recordings. Leverett then told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that the original acetates did not belong to Butrum, and that the two of them made a deal to share the profits of the planned Legacy Entertainment Group release.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}} The [[Universal Music Group]], the parent company of Polygram, then claimed ownership of the shows.{{sfn|Ragogna, Mike|2010}}

In January 2006, the [[Tennessee Court of Appeals]] upheld a lower court ruling stating that Williams's heirs—son, [[Hank Williams Jr]], and daughter, [[Jett Williams]]—have the sole rights to sell his recordings.{{sfn|AP staff|2006}} In 2008, [[Time-Life]] released ''Unreleased Recordings'', a selection of numbers pertaining to the ''Mother's Best Flour'' shows. In 2010, the company released a 15-CD box-set containing all of the recordings remastered by sound engineer Joe Palmaccio entitled ''The Complete Mothers' Best Recordings... Plus!''.{{sfn|Hyperbolium|2010}}

Newfield was born in [[Healdsburg, California]]. By age 13, she had decided to pursue a career in [[country music]]. In 1996, she joined Keith Burns and Ira Dean to form the group [[Trick Pony]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p477402/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Heidi Newfield biography |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |last=True |first=Chris |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Newfield recorded three albums as a member of Trick Pony: ''[[Trick Pony (album)|Trick Pony]]'' (2001), ''[[On a Mission (Trick Pony album)|On a Mission]]'' (2003) and ''[[R.I.D.E.]]'' (2005). These albums accounted for eight singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, including the group's highest peaking, the No.&nbsp;4 "[[On a Night like This (Trick Pony song)|On a Night like This]]," from 2001. Newfield sang lead vocals on most of the group's songs, including every single except "[[Just What I Do]]." She also played rhythm guitar and harmonica and co-wrote several songs on each album.

Newfield's first work outside of Trick Pony was as a guest vocalist on [[Cledus T. Judd]]'s cover of the [[Ray Stevens]] song "[[Gitarzan]]", featured on Judd's 2007 album ''[[Boogity, Boogity - A Tribute to the Comedic Genius of Ray Stevens]]''.

"Johnny & June" peaked at number 11 on the country charts, in late September 2008, and was followed a month later by "Cry Cry ('Til the Sun Shines)". This song, originally recorded by [[Martina McBride]] on her album ''[[Waking Up Laughing]]'', peaked at 29 in early 2009. The title track was released as the album's third single on May 4, 2009, and reached 57.

In November 2010, Newfield announced that she would be working with producer [[Blake Chancey]] on a second album. Its first single, "Stay Up Late," which was written by [[Ben Hayslip]], [[Sonya Isaacs]], and [[Jimmy Yeary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1651797/heidi-newfield-previews-new-single.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204022200/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1651797/heidi-newfield-previews-new-single.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 4, 2011|title=Heidi Newfield Previews New Single|date=November 8, 2010|work=CMT|accessdate=December 2, 2010}}</ref> was released in March 2011 and peaked at number 51 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart.

Newfield, pictured in a faded "NRA Country" ballcap for ''American Hunter'' magazine discussed her favorite types of hunting and her love of the outdoors. The [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] named Heidi Newfield as their NRA Country Artist of the Month, October 2012.  In the article Newfield discussed life on the road and her genuine love of the outdoors.  She was quoted as saying that her favorite hunting season is deer season because of the cold weather and football.  Newfield talks about enjoying "wild hog roasts and big, warm fires" in addition to hunting blacktail deer near her home in Northern California.  Further, Newfield shared with NRA Country that "Country is much more than the place you were born and raised.  To me, it’s about having a love for our beautiful land and a respect for this great nation’s founding principles.  I’ve been lucky enough to travel across the U.S. and I think it’s the best place on earth.  I’m Heidi Newfield and I am NRA Country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2012/10/03/heidi-newfield-is-octobers-nra-country-artist-of-the-month/|title=Heidi Newfield is October's NRA Country Artist of the Month|date=October 1, 2012|work=Great American Country (GAC)|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Career==
After his discharge from the Navy, Axton began singing folk songs in coffee houses and nightclubs in Southern California. In the early 1960s, he released his first folk album, ''The Balladeer'' (recorded at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|the Troubadour]]), which included his song "Greenback Dollar." It became a 1963 hit for [[the Kingston Trio]].<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

Axton released numerous albums throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the mid-1970's he produced studio covers of his own music for [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]], and also produced ''Tales From the Ozone'', a 1975 album by [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]]. He released many minor hits of his own, such as "Boney Fingers", "When the Morning Comes" and 1979's "Della and the Dealer".<ref name=Pareles /> His vocal style featured his distinctive bass-baritone (which later deepened to near-bass) and use of [[characterization]].

Axton first appeared on television in a [[David L. Wolper]] ABC production of ''The Story of a Folksinger'' (1963). He appeared on ''[[Hootenanny (US TV series)|Hootenanny]]'', hosted by [[Jack Linkletter]], during this period. In 1965, he appeared in an episode of ''[[Bonanza]]''<ref name=Pareles /> in which he sang duets with [[Pernell Roberts]]. In 1966, he made his film debut in ''[[Smoky (1966 film)|Smoky]]'' playing the role of Fred Denton, the evil brother of the character played by [[Fess Parker]]. He gained fame in the 1970s and 1980s through his film roles, including those in ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979), ''[[Liar's Moon]]'' (1982), ''[[Heart Like a Wheel (film)|Heart Like a Wheel]]'' (1983) and ''[[Gremlins (film)|Gremlins]]'' (1984). His television appearances included ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' (1976), ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' (1976), ''[[WKRP In Cincinnati|WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' (1979) and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1984, 1985). In 1980, he sang the theme song to the short-lived series ''[[Flo (TV series)|Flo]]'', and guest-starred as himself in the episode titled "You Gotta Have Hoyt". Axton sang the jingle "The Ballad of Big Mac" for a 1969 [[McDonald's]] [[Big Mac]] television commercial as well as "Head for the Mountains" in voiceovers for [[Busch Beer|Busch]] beer in the 1980s. He appeared in a [[Pizza Hut]] commercial in 1985 and in a TV spot for [[Florists' Transworld Delivery|FTD]] with [[Merlin Olsen]] in 1989.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 1991 Axton was awarded an induction to The Walk of Western Stars in Newhall, California.

Axton's most lasting contributions, however, were songs made famous by others: "[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]" ([[Three Dog Night]]) and "[[Never Been to Spain]]" for both Three Dog Night and [[Elvis Presley]], "Greenback Dollar" for the Kingston Trio, "[[The Pusher]]" and "Snowblind Friend"  for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], "[[No No Song]]" for [[Ringo Starr]], and songs covered by singers such as [[Joan Baez]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[John Denver]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Martha Reeves]], [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Anne Murray]], [[David Clayton-Thomas]] and [[Colter Wall]]. Axton sang [[Duet (music)|duets]] with [[Linda Ronstadt]] on the songs "Lion in the Winter" and "[[When the Morning Comes (song)|When the Morning Comes]]", with Renee Armand on "Boney Fingers" and with [[Tanya Tucker]] on "You Taught Me How to Cry." His composition "Joy to the World", performed by Three Dog Night, reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for six straight weeks in 1971, making it the top hit of the year. He named his record label Jeremiah after the bullfrog mentioned in the song.<ref name= "LATimes obit" />

==Personal life==
Axton was married four times; his first three marriages ended in divorce.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> He had five children.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> One of his children, Matt Axton, is a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mattaxton.com| title=Matt Axton Music|access-date=February 5, 2024}}</ref>

Axton struggled with [[cocaine]] addiction, and several of his songs, including "The Pusher", "Snowblind Friend" and "No No Song", partly reflect his experiences with the drug.<ref name= "LATimes obit"/> He was a proponent of medical marijuana use, but he and his wife Deborah were arrested in February 1997 at their Montana home for possession of about {{cvt|500|g|lb|abbr=on}} of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. His wife later explained that she offered Axton marijuana to relieve his pain and stress following his 1995 stroke. They were fined and received [[deferred sentence]]s. Axton never fully recovered from his stroke, and he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.{{fact|date=June 2024}}

'''Jerry Lee Lewis''' (September 29, 1935{{snd}}October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer and songwriter. Nicknamed "'''The Killer'''", he was described as "[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. "[[Crazy Arms]]" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", "[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]", and "[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]".

His rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]] and had hits with songs such as "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321082649/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |url-status=live }}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included "[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]", "[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]", "[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]", and "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]".

Lewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s "Rockin' My Life Away". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.

Lewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Music Hall of Fame |url=http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |access-date=October 12, 2016 |website=Memphismusichalloffame.com |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009220210/http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire]]'', starring [[Dennis Quaid]]. In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed his box set ''[[All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology]]'' at number 242 on their list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]".<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=November 1, 2003 |title=All Killer, No Filler! |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/articles/story/6599768/242_all_killer_no_filler |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205025124/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jerryleelewis/articles/story/6599768/242_all_killer_no_filler |archive-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref> In 2004, they ranked him No. 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=The Immortals: The First Fifty |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316103016/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 16, 2006 |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=946}}</ref> Lewis was the last surviving member of [[Sun Records]]' [[Million Dollar Quartet]] and the album ''[[Class of '55: Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming|Class of '55]]'', which also included [[Johnny Cash]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Elvis Presley]].

Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said of Lewis: "His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable [[boogie]]-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of [[The Void (philosophy)|the void]] make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller."<ref name="Christgau"/>

==Early life==
Jerry Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, to Elmo Kidd Lewis Sr. and Mary "Mamie" Herron Lewis in [[Ferriday, Louisiana]]. He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular televangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon – Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday. The hit of his set was his performance of [[R&B]] artist [[Stick McGhee]]'s "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Palmer |first=Robert |date=December 13, 1979 |title=The Devil and Jerry Lee Lewis |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-devil-and-jerry-lee-lewis-2-179111/ |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620171628/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-devil-and-jerry-lee-lewis-2-179111/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On the live album ''By Request, More of the Greatest Live Show on Earth'', Lewis is heard naming [[Moon Mullican]] as an artist who inspired him.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{Cite web |title=Moon Mullican {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=AllMusic |archive-date=August 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210804185528/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |url-status=live }}</ref>

His mother enrolled him at the [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University|Southwest Bible Institute]] in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], so that he could sing evangelical songs exclusively. When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of "My God Is Real" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some "worldly" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. After that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], becoming part of the burgeoning new [[rock and roll]] sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1952 for [[Cosimo Matassa]] in New Orleans.<ref name=jms>{{Cite web |last=Halsey |first=Jay |year=2021 |title=The Killer Rocks J&M |url=http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |website=The Cosimo Code |access-date=October 29, 2022 |archive-date=September 2, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220902142443/http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tomko|first=Gene|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Louisiana Musicians: Jazz, Blues, Cajun, Creole, Zydeco, Swamp Pop, and Gospel|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2020|isbn=978-0807169322|location=Baton Rouge|pages=160|access-date=December 1, 2021|archive-date=July 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173501/https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Around 1955, he traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he was already at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in [[Shreveport]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2012 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 21, 2021 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204174946/https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Career==
===J&M Studio===
Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s [[J&M Recording Studio]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. He covered [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s "Don't Stay Away (Till Love Grows Cold)" and his own instrumental composition "Jerry's Boogie" ({{aka}} New Orleans Boogie).<ref name=jms/>

===Sun Records===

[[File:GreenbackDollar.ogg|right|thumb|[[Sun Records]] artist [[Ray Harris]] singing the song "Greenback Dollar", with Lewis playing the piano]]
In November 1956, Lewis traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to audition for [[Sun Records]]. Label owner [[Sam Phillips]] was in Florida, but producer and engineer [[Jack Clement]] recorded Lewis's rendition of [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]'s "[[Crazy Arms]]" and his own composition "[[End of the Road (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|End of the Road]]". In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]", "[[Your True Love]]", and "Put Your Cat Clothes On" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s "Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll".

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]] and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8 /> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, were released on CD as ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's "[[Don't Be Cruel]]" and "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]", [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]", and [[Pat Boone]]'s "Don't Forbid Me".
[[File:Great Balls of Fire - You Win Again - Cash Box ad 1957.jpg|thumb|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' advertisement, November 16, 1957]] 
Lewis's own singles (on which he was billed as "Jerry Lee Lewis And His Pumping Piano") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]", a [[Big Maybelle]] cover, and "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame and criticism of the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. According to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to [[Hell]].<ref>Cash, Johnny (1997). ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. p. 98.</ref> This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.

As part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the [[piano bench]] aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keys, sat on the keyboard and stood on the piano. He told ''the [[Pop Chronicles]]'' that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act.<ref name="pc8">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19756/m1/ |title=Show 8 – The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the Rock-a-Billies.

His dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'' (he sang the title song from the back of a [[flatbed truck]]), and ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''. [[Cub Koda]] called him "rock & roll's first great wild man" and also "rock & roll's first great eclectic".<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Cub |last1=Koda |author-link=Cub Koda |editor-last=Bogdanov |editor-first=Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd |title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music |publisher=Backbeat Books |year=2001 |isbn=9780879306274 |location=San Francisco |page=[https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd/page/234 234] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Classical composer [[Michael Nyman]] has also cited Lewis's style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.<ref>[[Andrew Ford (composer)|Andrew Ford]].

In 1960, Phillips opened a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sam Phillips: The Sound and Legacy of Sun Records |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2001/nov/phillips/011128.sam.phillips.html |access-date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=npr.org |archive-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016031755/http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2001/nov/phillips/011128.sam.phillips.html |url-status=live }}</ref> abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Carl Perkins]], Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]], and others, and also opened a studio in [[Nashville]]. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of "[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]" (September 1962 UK) and "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]" (March 1963) entered the [[hit parade]]. On popular EPs, "Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes", "I've Been Twistin{{'"}}, "Money", and "Hello Josephine" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent [[discothèque]]s. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]]'s "[[In the Mood]]" was issued on the [[Phillips International Records|Phillips International]] label under the pseudonym "The Hawk".<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2012 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 22, 2021 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204174946/https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Marriage controversy===
Lewis's turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a May 1958 British tour where Ray Berry, a news agency reporter at London's [[Heathrow Airport]] (the only journalist present), learned about Lewis's third wife, Myra Gale Brown. She is Lewis's first cousin once removed<ref>{{Cite web |last=Devin Miller |date=April 17, 1998 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Online Wild One's Clubhouse: The Largest Jerry Lee Lewis Homepage on the Internet! |url=http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Jerry9.tripod.com |archive-date=June 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623135413/http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cecil Adams |date=October 1, 2004 |title=What's wrong with cousins marrying? |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041001.html |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=The Straight Dope |archive-date=May 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526033048/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041001.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><!-- DO NOT CHANGE COUSIN STATEMENT - SEE TALK PAGE --> and was 13 years old when they married—though Lewis, who was 22 years old at the time, claimed she was actually 15.

===Smash Records===
Lewis's Sun recording contract ended in 1963, and he joined [[Smash Records]], where he made several rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of [[Mercury Records]]) came up with "I'm on Fire", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as [[Colin Escott]] writes in the sleeve to the retrospective ''A Half Century of Hits'', "Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if [[the Beatles]] hadn't arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn't really know what to do with Lewis after that."<ref name="Escott">{{citation|title=A Half Century Of Hits|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/A_Half_Century_Of_Hits.html|type=CD liner|date=January 2006|author=Colin Escott|publisher=[[Time Life]]|access-date=October 30, 2022|archive-date=April 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420104332/http://albumlinernotes.com/A_Half_Century_Of_Hits.html|url-status=live}}</ref> One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European fans had shown for Lewis's firebrand rock and roll. In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the ''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV Royal Daffodil]]'', for a [[English Channel|cross-channel]] rock and roll cruise from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend, Essex]], to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]]. For this performance, he was backed by [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[The Outlaws (band)|the Outlaws]].<ref name="Bloom2009">{{Cite book |last=Jerry Bloom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5 |title=Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore |date=November 5, 2009 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=978-0-85712-053-3 |pages=100 |access-date=March 10, 2020 |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173507/https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5 |url-status=live }}</ref> None of Lewis's early Smash albums, including ''[[The Return of Rock]]'', ''[[Memphis Beat]]'', and ''[[Soul My Way]]'', were commercial successes.

===''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg''===

The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, "Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll..." The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that "''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion."

===Country comeback===
[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]
Frustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the [[Jerry Chesnut]] song "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 "looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956." The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with "Pen and Paper" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but "Another Place, Another Time" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.

Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", "To Make Love Sweeter For You", "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", "Since I Met You Baby", "Once More With Feeling", "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick "[[Nashville sound]]" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".

In a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, "[[One Minute Past Eternity]]", was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit "She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye". Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.

===Grand Ole Opry appearance===
Lewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', he had maintained an ambivalence to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: "It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't [[schmooze]] there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different."<ref name="Escott"/>

As recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]". Ignoring his allotted time constraints—and, thus, commercial breaks—Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]—the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager—out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On", "Workin' Man Blues", "Good Golly, Miss Molly", and a number of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021172629/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===
[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]
Lewis returned to the pop charts with "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]" in 1971 and "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut "Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee" was the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' was his highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, "the Killer" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: "During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog." During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, "Do you wanna try one?", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, "If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=The Vinyl District |archive-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115110247/http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was "Middle Age Crazy", which made it to number 4 in 1977.

===Later career===
[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]
In 1979, Lewis switched record labels to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.

In 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called "It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart had a complex relationship over the years.

Receiving positive reviews, the album charted on four different Billboard charts, including a two-week stay at number one on the Indie charts. A DVD entitled ''[[Last Man Standing Live]]'', featuring concert footage with many guest artists, was released in March 2007.

On June 4, 2008, Lewis was inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] and appeared on ''[[A Capitol Fourth]]'' and performed the finale's final act with a medley of "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]", "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On", and "Great Balls of Fire".

In December 2019, Lewis was honored with a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker at his ranch in [[Nesbit, Mississippi]] to celebrate his contributions to country music.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 19, 2019 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Receives Mississippi Country Music Trail Marker |url=https://visitmississippi.org/jerry-lee-lewis-receives-mississippi-country-music-trail-marker/ |website=Visit Mississippi |access-date=February 4, 2020 |archive-date=February 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204105154/https://visitmississippi.org/jerry-lee-lewis-receives-mississippi-country-music-trail-marker/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In May 2022, Lewis was announced as a member-elect to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], to be inducted in October 2022.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://eu.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/country-music-hall-fame-class-2022-inductees/9805843002/ |website=The Tennessean |first1=Marcus K. |last1=Dowling |first2=Dave |last2=Paulson |first3=Matthew |last3=Leimkuehler |date=May 17, 2022 | title=Keith Whitley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Joe Galante are headed to the Country Music Hall of Fame | access-date=May 17, 2022 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240823203032/https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/country-music-hall-fame-class-2022-inductees/9805843002/ |archive-date= 23 Aug 2024  }}</ref> "This year's inductees are trailblazers who each paved their own unique path within country music," Sarah Trahern, CMA chief executive officer, said.

===Piano style===
Lewis was an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Robert Fontenot |date=March 4, 2019 |title=Did Jerry Lee Lewis Really Set His Pianos on Fire Onstage? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/jerry-lee-lewis-setting-his-pianos-on-fire-on-stage-2523388 |access-date=October 1, 2019 |website=Thoughtco.com |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417065338/https://www.thoughtco.com/jerry-lee-lewis-setting-his-pianos-on-fire-on-stage-2523388 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style became synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players.

In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, [[Elton John]] recalls that up until "Great Balls of Fire", "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. My dad collected [[George Shearing]] records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." Lewis was primarily known for his "[[boogie-woogie]]" style, which is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on ''Memphis Sounds with [[George Klein (disc jockey)|George Klein]]'' in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice-looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much." Lewis also cited [[Moon Mullican]] as a source of inspiration.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Episode 59: "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" by Jerry Lee Lewis - A History Of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs |url=https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1437402802/a-history-of-rock-music-in-five-hundred-songs/episode-59-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on-by-jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=Poddtoppen |language=sv |archive-date=September 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922062821/https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1437402802/a-history-of-rock-music-in-five-hundred-songs/episode-59-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on-by-jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lewis's second marriage to Sally Jane Mitcham in September 1953, was of dubious validity because it occurred 23 days before his divorce from Barton was final. They had two children: Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. (1954–1973) and Ronnie Guy Lewis (b. 1956). After four years, he filed for divorce in October 1957.

===Religious beliefs===
As a teenager, Lewis studied at the Southwest Bible Institute in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], before being thrown out for playing a 'worldly' [[boogie-woogie]] version of "My God Is Real", and that early incident foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing "the devil's music". Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous ("How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because "only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]", and {{"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words... they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October–November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>

In the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, "The Bible doesn't even speak of religion. No word of religion is even in the Bible. ''Sanctification!'' Are you sanctified? Have you been ''saved''? See, I was a good preacher, I know my Bible? I find myself falling short of the glory of God."

Gospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire. After a string of hit country albums, he recorded [[In Loving Memories: The Jerry Lee Lewis Gospel Album|a gospel album]] for the first time in 1970 (it was released in 1971).<ref>{{Citation |title=Jerry Lee Lewis - In Loving Memories Album Reviews, Songs & More |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/in-loving-memories-mr0002561399 |work=AllMusic |language=en |access-date=October 30, 2022 |archive-date=October 30, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221030134931/https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/in-loving-memories-mr0002561399 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Graceland arrest===

On September 29, 1976 (Lewis's 41st birthday), Lewis fired a [[.357 Magnum]] at a Coke bottle in his bedroom. The bullet ricocheted and accidentally hit bassist Butch Owens in the chest. Owens survived.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Young |first=Charles M. |date=October 19, 2006 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: The Killer Reloaded |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jerry-lee-lewis-the-killer-reloaded-39491/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818111954/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jerry-lee-lewis-the-killer-reloaded-39491/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On November 23, 1976, Lewis was arrested outside [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[Graceland]] home for allegedly intending to shoot him.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Dan Epstein |first=Richard Bienstock |date=February 27, 2014 |title=30 Most Embarrassing Rock-Star Arrests |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/30-most-embarrassing-rock-star-arrests-22579/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818111948/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/30-most-embarrassing-rock-star-arrests-22579/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography, ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', Lewis said that the reclusive Presley had been trying to reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to "come out to the house." Lewis replied that he would if he had time, but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] for [[driving under the influence]]. Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.

Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but "Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The [[Memphis police]] found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs." Lewis said, "The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world. Presley himself died at Graceland nine months later.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tosches |first=Nick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |title=Country: The Twisted Roots Of Rock 'n' Roll |date=2009 |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=978-0-7867-5098-6 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173511/https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=November 4, 2014 |title=The Killer at Peace: Jerry Lee Lewis' Golden Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |page=3 |access-date=October 14, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818112008/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |website=The Smoking Gun |date=June 12, 2014 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915081623/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Career ==
[[File:Lauderdale-fls.jpg|thumb|left|Jim Lauderdale at MerleFest in 2007.]]

After graduating from college, Lauderdale lived in Nashville for five months in the summer of 1979 while he tried to get a recording or publishing deal. He hung out a lot with [[Roland White]], an accomplished mandolin player, with whom he cut a record. But things never took off, so he decided to move to New York,<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013>{{cite web|last=Dye|first=David|title=Buddy Miller And Jim Lauderdale On World Cafe |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/11/176161225/buddy-miller-and-jim-lauderdale-on-world-cafe|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=January 3, 2014|format=audio interview|date=April 11, 2013}}</ref> where he played in [[Floyd Domino]]'s band and performed as a solo artist. In 1980 he met singer-songwriter [[Buddy Miller]].<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 /> He played in Miller's band in the active twang music scene that was evolving at the time.<ref name=DO-1999 />

During his time in New York City, he also worked in the mailroom and as a messenger at ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref name=NPR-Buddy&JimTDC /> He often was assigned to pick up and drop off photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]]'s equipment.<ref name=DO-1999 />

Lauderdale joined the national touring production of ''[[Pump Boys & Dinettes]]'', which eventually reached Los Angeles where he met musicians [[Rosie Flores]], Billy Bremmer, [[Pete Anderson]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], and others.<ref name=DO-1999 /> John Ciambotti became Lauderdale's manager and Lauderdale relocated to Los Angeles in the late 1980s, recording an album for CBS (which was later released as ''The Point of No Return''). The record was influenced by the [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] sound of [[Buck Owens]].<ref name=DO-1999 />

Armed with a catalog of a few hundred songs he had written, Lauderdale was able to get a publishing deal with a small company called Blue Water Music (based in Houston, with a small office in Nashville). Living in Los Angeles he made a record with Anderson producing, but it was never released.<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 />

Lauderdale then got a publishing deal with Reprise and moved into the second floor of Buddy and Julie Miller's house until he got his own place in Nashville.<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 />

In 2013, Lauderdale started his own record label, Sky Crunch, so that he could release his many albums on a schedule that suited him.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode275 Americana Music Show #275], published December 1, 2015</ref>

In April 2018, Lauderdale signed to Yep Roc Records.<ref name=Yep-Roc-Records>{{cite web|title=Yep Roc Records Welcomes Jim Lauderdale!|url=http://www.yeproc.com/yep-roc-records-welcomes-jim-lauderdale|access-date=May 23, 2018|date=April 24, 2018}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===

Lauderdale's solo debut, ''Planet of Love'', was produced by [[Rodney Crowell]] and [[John Leventhal]] and released in 1991.<ref name=DO-1999 /><ref name=MusicMonitor-TurnLeft>{{cite web |last=Winkworth |first=Bruce |title=Go to the Country, Turn Left |url=http://www.penduluminc.com/MM/articles/lauderdale.html |work=The Music Monitor|access-date=December 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106152010/http://www.penduluminc.com/MM/articles/lauderdale.html|archive-date=November 6, 2006}}</ref> ''Lost in the Lonesome Pines'', a 2002 collaboration with [[Ralph Stanley]], won the [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]].

=== Collaborations ===
In 2007, he began a collaboration with [[Larry Campbell]], the band Olabelle, and others in the ''American Beauty Project,'' a loose collection of musicians dedicated to reimagining in performance the [[Grateful Dead]]'s two classic 1970 albums, ''[[Workingman's Dead]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]''.

In 2011, Lauderdale toured with [[Hot Tuna]], an ensemble act that included [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Jack Casady]], Barry Mitterhof, [[G.E. Smith]], and, for a time, [[Charlie Musselwhite]]. He has also toured with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rhonda Vincent]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and others.

==== Dr. Ralph Stanley ====
Lauderdale wrote and produced two bluegrass records with [[Ralph Stanley]]. Their first collaboration, ''I Feel Like Singing Today'', was nominated for a Grammy.

==== Buddy Miller ====

Lauderdale released a record called ''Buddy and Jim'' with long-time friend and collaborator [[Buddy Miller]] in 2013.<ref name=NPR-Buddy&JimTDC>{{cite web|title=Buddy Miller & Jim Lauderdale: Tiny Desk Concert|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/183595144/buddy-miller-jim-lauderdale-tiny-desk-concert|work=Tiny Desk Concert|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|format=video performance and interview|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref> Lauderdale said they recorded it in three days in Miller's home studio.

==== Robert Hunter ====
Lauderdale has often collaborated with [[Grateful Dead]] lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]].<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

Lauderdale's first collaboration with Hunter was ''Headed for the Hills'' and the second was ''Patchwork River'' in May 2010. The June 2011 release ''Reason and Rhyme'' was their third collaboration. Additionally, they wrote songs for a [[North Mississippi Allstars]] record that was released in the fall of 2013.<ref name=TwangNation2013 />

Two 2013 releases, ''Black Roses'' and ''Blue Moon Junction,'' were co-written with Hunter. ''Black Roses'' features North Mississippi Allstars' Cody and [[Luther Dickinson]], whom Lauderdale met in Nashville at the Americana Music Festival,<ref name=CMTEdge-2014>{{cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Brian T.|title=Jim Lauderdale Teams Up for New Albums, Grammy Nod|url=http://www.cmtedge.com/2014/01/09/jim-lauderdale-teams-up-for-new-albums-grammy-nod/|work=CMT Edge|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] / [[Country Music Television|Country Music Television, Inc.]]|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref> as well as [[Muscle Shoals]] musicians [[Spooner Oldham]] and [[David Hood]]. The album was recorded at their father [[Jim Dickinson]]'s studio, Zebra Ranch in Mississippi.<ref name=CMTEdge-2014 />

2013's ''Blue Moon Junction'' features Lauderdale's work as a singer and songwriter, some of them co-written with Hunter in a solo, acoustic format. Lauderdale produced the record.<ref name=CMTEdge-2014 /> Lauderdale says that they have more material that might make a good follow-up album, and hopes they will have time to collaborate again soon.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Nick Lowe ====
Lauderdale performed solo as the opening act for [[Nick Lowe]] on the latter's 1995 tour of the U.S. and Europe with the Impossible Birds. He later recorded with longtime members of Lowe's band and other British musicians at London's Goldtop Studio, sessions resulting in the 2017 album ''London Southern''.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Roland White ====

On August 3, 2018, Lauderdale released ''Jim Lauderdale and Roland White,'' a previously lost record made with mandolin master [[Roland White]]. The disc was recorded in Earl Scruggs' basement in 1979, and the songs were only found recently by White's wife.<ref name=RollingStone-2018/>

=== The Jim Lauderdale Phenomenon ===
The term "the Jim Lauderdale Phenomenon", coined by singer-songwriter [[Kim Richey]] and cited in an April 2000 article in ''[[The Tennessean]]'' by writer Peter Cooper, is an ironic reference to the fact that Lauderdale was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for his work with Stanley but was released from a record deal with [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA]] not long after. He was also released from contracts with Warner Bros., Columbia, and Atlantic Records.<ref name=Tennessean-RCA-drop>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Peter|title=Without 'star-level' clout, Lauderdale released from RCA|url=http://www.insurgentcountry.com/jim_lauderdale_dropped_from_rca.txt|work=[[The Tennessean]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221172233/http://www.insurgentcountry.com/jim_lauderdale_dropped_from_rca.txt|archive-date=February 21, 2001}}</ref><ref name=CL-Whisper-review>{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=James|title=Music: Jim Lauderdale, Whisper|url=http://web.cln.com/archives/atlanta/newsstand/030798/v_rec7.htm|work=[[Creative Loafing]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010222041342/http://web.cln.com/archives/atlanta/newsstand/030798/v_rec7.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2001}}</ref> The article notes that many country artists that were signed to major labels in the 1990s failed to get radio airtime and had their contracts dropped after making one or two albums.<ref name=Tennessean-RCA-drop/> The problem became widespread in Nashville during this period, when a lot of good music was being created and recorded, but the megastars dominated the airwaves.<ref name=DO-PenPal-1998>{{cite news|last=Rowland|first=Hobart|title=Pen pal: Jim Lauderdale is the write man in the wrong place|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1998-05-21/music/pen-pal/|access-date=December 14, 2013|newspaper=Dallas Observer|date=May 21, 1998}}</ref>

'''James Travis Reeves''' (August 20, 1923{{spaced ndash}}July 31, 1964) was an American [[country music|country]] and popular music singer and songwriter. With records charting from the 1950s to the 1980s, he became well known as a practitioner of the [[Nashville Sound]]. Known as "Gentleman Jim", his songs continued to chart for years after his death in a plane crash. He is a member of both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame|Country Music]] and [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame|Texas Country Music]] Halls of Fame.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Reeves was born at home in [[Galloway, Texas]], a small rural community near [[Carthage, Texas|Carthage]]. He was the youngest of eight children born to Thomas Middleton Reeves (1882-1924) and Mary Beulah Adams Reeves (1884-1980). He was known as Travis during his childhood years. Winning an athletic scholarship to the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], he enrolled to study speech and drama but quit after only six weeks to work in the shipyards in [[Houston]]. Soon he resumed baseball, playing in the semi-professional leagues before contracting with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] "farm" team during 1944 as a right-handed pitcher. He played for the minor leagues for three years before severing his [[sciatic nerve]] while pitching, which ended his athletic career.<ref>Jordan, Larry, ''Jim Reeves: His Untold Story'', Page Turner Books International, 2011, pp. 58–59.</ref>

===Early career===
Reeves' initial efforts to pursue a baseball career were sporadic, possibly due to his uncertainty as to whether he would be drafted into the military as [[World War II]] enveloped the United States. On March 9, 1943, he reported to the Army Induction Center in [[Tyler, Texas]] for his preliminary physical examination. However, he failed the exam (probably due to a heart irregularity), and on 4 August 1943 an official letter declared his 4-F draft status.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=G-OGHWrU4HMC&q=why+did+jim+reeves+not+serve+in+the+US+military+during+World+War+II%3F&pg=PA629 ''Jim Reeves - His Untold Story''] p. 41</ref>
Reeves began to work as a radio announcer and sang live between songs. During the late 1940s, he was contracted with a couple of small Texas-based recording companies, but without success. Reeves at this point was influenced by early country and western swing artists including [[Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Moon Mullican]], as well as popular singers [[Bing Crosby]], [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. In the late 1940s, Reeves joined Moon Mullican's band, and as a solo artist, Reeves recorded Mullican-style songs including "Each Beat of my Heart" and "My Heart's Like a Welcome Mat" in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

During these years, Reeves took a job as an announcer for [[KWKH|KWKH-AM]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], then the home of the popular radio program ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''. According to former ''Hayride'' master of ceremonies [[Frank Page (broadcaster)|Frank Page]], who had introduced [[Elvis Presley]] on the program in 1954,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theeagle/obituary.aspx?n=frank-page&pid=162291737#fbLoggedOut|title=Frank Page Obituary|newspaper=[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]|access-date=January 12, 2013}}</ref> singer [[Sleepy LaBeef]] was late for a performance, and Reeves was asked to substitute. (Other accounts—including that of Reeves himself, in an interview on the [[RCA Victor]] album ''Yours Sincerely''—name [[Hank Williams]] as the absentee.)

===Initial success in the 1950s===
Jim Reeves was a country music singer who had success early on in his career, first with the song "[[Mexican Joe (song)|Mexican Joe]]" in 1953 for Abbott Records.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-mary-reeves-1126808.html|title=Obituary: Mary Reeves|date=October 23, 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref> Other hits followed, such as "I Love You" (a duet with [[Ginny Wright]]), and "[[Bimbo (song)|Bimbo]]" which reached number one on the U.S. country charts in 1954. In addition to those early hits, Reeves recorded many other songs for Fabor Records and [[Abbott Records]]. In 1954, Abbott Records released a 45 single with "Bimbo" on side-A which hit number one and featured Little Joe Hunt of the Arkansas Walk of Fame. Jim Reeves and Little Joe Hunt met at the Louisiana Hayride, which was Louisiana's equivalent to Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. After performing at the Hayride in Shreveport,  Reeves and Hunt traveled and performed together for several years in the dance halls and clubs of East Texas and rural Arkansas. Reeves became the headliner with Hunt as the backup performer. Due to his growing popularity, Reeves went on to release his first album in November 1955, ''[[Jim Reeves Sings]]'' (Abbott 5001), which proved to be one of Abbott Records' few album releases. Reeves' star was on the rise because he had already been signed to a 10-year recording contract with [[RCA Victor]] by [[Steve Sholes]]. Sholes went on to produce some of Reeves' first recordings at RCA Victor. Sholes signed another performer from the Louisiana Hayride that same year (1955), [[Elvis Presley]]. Most of the talented performers of the 1950s such as Reeves, Presley, [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Jim Ed Brown]],  [[Maxine Brown (country singer)|Maxine Brown]], [[the Wilburn Brothers]], and Little Joe Hunt got their start at the Louisiana Hayride. In addition to the Hayride, Jim Reeves joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]], also in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinopal|first=David|title=Jim Reeves' biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jim-reeves-p1784/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 28, 2012}}</ref> Reeves also made his first appearance on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in 1955. He was such a hit with the fans that he was invited to act as fill-in host from May thru July 1958 on the popular program, ''Ozark Jubilee''.

From his earliest recordings with RCA Victor, Reeves relied on the loud, East Texas style, which was considered standard for [[country and western]] performers of that time, but he developed a new style of singing over the course of his career. He said, "One of these days.....I'm gonna sing like I want to sing!" So, he decreased his volume and used the lower registers of his singing voice, with his lips nearly touching the microphone. Amid protests from RCA, but with the endorsement of his producer [[Chet Atkins]], Reeves used this new style in a 1957 recording, a demonstration song of lost love that had originally been intended for a female voice. It was titled "[[Four Walls (Jim Reeves song)|Four Walls]]", which not only scored number one on the country music charts, but also scored number 11 on the popular music charts, as well. This recording marked his transition from novelty songs to serious country-pop music, and according to one source, "established Reeves as a country balladeer".<ref name="auto"/> "Four Walls" and "[[He'll Have to Go]]" (1959) defined Reeves' style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jim-reeves-mn0000903609/biography|title=Jim Reeves &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref>

Reeves was instrumental in creating a new style of country music that used violins and lusher background arrangements that soon became known as the [[Nashville Sound]]. This new sound was able to cross genres, which made Reeves even more popular as a recording artist.

Reeves became known as a crooner because of his light yet rich [[baritone]] voice. Because of his vocal style, he was also considered a talented artist because of his versatility in crossing the music charts. He appealed to audiences that were not necessarily country/western. His catalog of songs such as "[[Adios Amigo (Jim Reeves song)|Adios Amigo]]", "[[Welcome to My World (Jim Reeves song)|Welcome to My World]]", and "[[Am I Losing You?]]" demonstrated this appeal. Many of his Christmas songs have become perennial favorites, including "C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S",<ref>First made famous nationally by [[Eddy Arnold]] in 1949.</ref> "[[Blue Christmas (song)|Blue Christmas]]", and "An Old Christmas Card".

Between 1957 and 1958, Reeves was the host of a radio show on the ABC network. Debuting on October 7, 1957, the program was broadcast weekdays from 1 to 2 p.m. from Nashville, Tennessee. It featured the [[Anita Kerr|Anita Kerr Singers]] and [[Owen Bradley|Owen Bradley's]] orchestra.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shepard |first1=Richard F. |title=Lowell Thomas Bound for Arctic: 4 Seasoned Explorers Will Aid Film for TV Series-- New Weekday Program |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/08/31/archives/lowell-thomas-bound-for-arctic-4-seasoned-explorers-will-aid-film.html?searchResultPosition=1 |access-date=August 25, 2024 |work=The New York Times |date=August 31, 1957 |page=33|url-access=subscription}}</ref> This was also when he began shifting from cowboy outfits to sports jackets.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=untabCgOVkgC&dq=Jim+Reeves++&pg=PA578|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|first1=Michael|last1=McCall|first2=John|last2=Rumble|first3=Paul|last3=Kingsbury|date=December 16, 2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-977055-7|access-date=August 9, 2021|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Reeves is also responsible for popularizing many gospel songs, including "We Thank Thee", "[[Take My Hand, Precious Lord]]", "Across the Bridge", and "Where We'll Never Grow Old". He was given the nickname Gentleman Jim, an apt description of his character both on stage and off.

===Early 1960s and international fame===
Reeves scored his greatest success with the [[Joe Allison]] composition "[[He'll Have to Go]]",<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/|title=Show 10 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis. [Part 2] }}</ref> a success on both the popular and country music charts, which earned him a [[platinum record]]. Released during late 1959, it scored number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Hot Country Songs]] chart on February 8, 1960, which it scored for 14 consecutive weeks. Country music historian Bill Malone noted that while it was in many ways a conventional country song, its arrangement and the vocal chorus "put this recording in the country-pop vein". In addition, Malone lauded Reeves' vocal styling—lowered to "its natural resonant level" to project the "caressing style that became famous"—as to why "many people refer to him as the singer with the velvet voice."<ref>Malone, Bill, ''Classic Country Music: A Smithsonian Collection'' (booklet included with ''[[Classic Country Music: A Smithsonian Collection]]'' 4-disc set). Smithsonian Institution, 1990, p. 51.</ref> In 1963, he released his ''[[Twelve Songs of Christmas]]'' album, which had the well-known songs "C.H.R.I.S.T.M.A.S" and "An Old Christmas Card". 
During 1975, RCA Victor producer Chet Atkins told interviewer Wayne Forsythe, "Jim wanted to be a tenor, but I wanted him to be a baritone... I was right, of course. After he changed his voice to that smooth, deeper sound, he was immensely popular."<ref>"Gentleman Jim" by Wayne Forsythe, Country Song Roundup, August 1975</ref>

Reeves' international popularity during the 1960s, surpassing his popularity in the United States at times, helped to give country music a worldwide market for the first time. According to ''Billboard'', "Reeves’ star shone equally bright overseas in the United Kingdom, India, Germany, and even South Africa.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6205510/a-tribute-to-country-crooner-jim-reeves-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-his-death|title=A Tribute to Country Crooner Jim Reeves on the 50th Anniversary of His Death|magazine=Billboard|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref> Jim Reeves was hugely popular in Sri Lanka in the 1960s and 1970s<ref>{{cite web | url=https://vernoncorea.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/jim-reeves-on-radio-ceylon | title=Jim Reeves on Radio Ceylon | date=June 21, 2014 }}</ref> and presently he is the most popular English language singer in Sri Lanka.

====South Africa====
During the early 1960s, Reeves was more popular in South Africa than Elvis Presley, and recorded several albums in the [[Afrikaans language]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUAnDwAAQBAJ&dq=film+kimberley+jim+set+in+diamond+rush&pg=PA258|title=Changing Times: Music and Politics in 1964|first=Steve|last=Millward|date=June 12, 2017|publisher=Troubador Publishing Limited|isbn=9781788030588|access-date=August 9, 2021|via=Google Books}}</ref> In 1963, he toured and starred in a South African film, ''[[Kimberley Jim]]''. In the film, he sang part of one song in Afrikaans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mimosafilms.co.za/Archive/Film/65/kimberley-jim|title=Kimberley Jim - Mimosa Film Group|website=Mimosafilms.co.za|access-date=August 9, 2021|archive-date=November 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105064055/http://www.mimosafilms.co.za/Archive/Film/65/kimberley-jim|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film was released with a special prologue and epilogue in South African cinemas after Reeves' death, praising him as a true friend of the country. The film was produced, directed, and written by [[Emil Nofal]]. Reeves later said that he enjoyed the film-making experience and would consider devoting more of his career to this medium.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=Larry |date=December 24, 2018 |title=Jim Reeves: His Untold Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-OGHWrU4HMC&q=jim+reeves+beechcraft+crash&pg=PA617 |publisher=Page Turner Books International |page=467 |isbn=978-0615524306}}</ref> The film was released in South Africa (and also in the US) in 1965 after Reeves's death.

Reeves was one of an exclusive trio of performers to have released an album there that played at the little-used 16⅔ rpm speed. This unusual format was more suited to the spoken word and was quickly discontinued for music. The only other artists known to have released such albums in South Africa were [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Slim Whitman]].

====Britain and Ireland====
Reeves toured [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] during 1963, between his tours of South Africa and Europe. Reeves and the Blue Boys were in Ireland from May 30 to June 19, 1963, with a tour of US military bases from June 10 to 15, when they returned to Ireland. They performed in most counties in Ireland, though Reeves occasionally abbreviated performances because he was unhappy with the available pianos at concert venues. In a June 6, 1963 interview with ''Spotlight'' magazine, Reeves expressed his concerns about the tour schedule and the condition of the pianos, but said he was pleased with the audiences.

A press reception  for him at the Shannon Shamrock Inn was organized by Tom Monaghan of [[Bunratty Castle]], [[County Clare]]. Showband singers Maisie McDaniel and Dermot O'Brien welcomed him on May 29, 1963. A photograph appeared in the ''Limerick Leader'' on June 1, 1963. Press coverage continued from May until Reeves' arrival with a photograph of the press reception in ''The Irish Press''. ''Billboard'' magazine in the US also reported the tour before and after. The single "[[Welcome to My World (Jim Reeves song)|Welcome to My World]]" with the B/W side "Juanita" was released by RCA Victor during June 1963 and bought by the distributors Irish Records Factors Ltd. This scored the record number one while Reeves was there during June.

A number of accounts of his dances were given in the local newspapers, with a good one in ''The Kilkenny People'' of his dance in the Mayfair Ballroom, where 1,700 people were present. A photograph in ''The Donegal Democrat'' had Reeves' singing in the Pavesi Ball Room on June 7, 1963, and an account of his nonappearance on stage in ''The Diamond'', [[Kiltimagh]], [[County Mayo]] in ''The Western People'' representing how the tour went in different areas.

He planned to record an album of popular Irish songs, and had three number-one songs in Ireland during 1963 and 1964: "Welcome to My World", "[[I Love You Because (song)|I Love You Because]]", and "[[I Won't Forget You (Jim Reeves song)|I Won't Forget You]]". The last two are estimated to have sold 860,000 and 750,000, respectively, in Britain alone, excluding Ireland. Reeves had 11 songs in the Irish charts from 1962 to 1967. He recorded two Irish ballads, "[[Danny Boy]]" and "Maureen". "He'll Have to Go" was his most popular song there and was at number one and on the charts for months<!-- during 1960 -->. He was one of the most popular recording artists in Ireland, in the first 10 after [[the Beatles]], Elvis Presley, and [[Cliff Richard]].

He was permitted to perform in Ireland by the Irish Federation of Musicians on the condition that he share the bill with [[Irish show band]]s, becoming popular by 1963. The British Musicians' Union would not permit him to perform there, because no agreement existed for British show bands to travel to America, in exchange for the Blue Boys playing in Britain. Reeves did, however, perform for British radio and TV programmes.

During the 1960s, at the early stage of his career, [[Elton John]] performed at various pubs in England, frequently playing songs by Reeves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country-lists/elton-john-rocketman-best-country-songs-842933/|title=Elton John: His 10 Best Country Songs|first=Stephen L.|last=Betts|website=Rollingstone.com|date=June 1, 2019|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref>

====Norway====
Reeves played at the sports arena [[Njårdhallen]], Oslo, on April 15, 1964, with [[Bobby Bare]], [[Chet Atkins]], the Blue Boys, and the [[Anita Kerr|Anita Kerr Singers]]. They performed two concerts; the second was televised and recorded by  Norwegian network [[NRK]] (Norsk Rikskringkasting, the only one in [[Norway]] at the time). The complete concert, however, was not recorded, including some of Reeves' last songs. He reportedly performed "You're the Only Good Thing (That's Happened to Me)" in this section. The program has been repeated on NRK several times over the years.

His first success in Norway, "He'll Have to Go", scored number one in the top 10 and scored the chart for 29 weeks. "I Love You Because" was his greatest success in Norway, scoring number one during 1964 and on the list for 39 weeks. His albums spent 696 weeks in the Norwegian top-20 chart, making him one of the most popular music artists in the history of Norway.

===Last recording session===
Reeves' last two recording sessions for RCA Victor were held July 2, 1964; they produced the songs "[[Make the World Go Away]]", "[[Missing You (Red Sovine song)|Missing You]]", and "[[Is It Really Over?]]"  When the session ended with some time remaining on the schedule, Reeves suggested that he should record one more song. He taped "[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]", in what was to be his final RCA recording.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kboeradio.com/this-day-in-1964-jim-reeves-final-rca-sessions/|title=This day in 1964: Jim Reeves' final RCA Victor sessions &#124; KBOE 104.9FM Hot Country|website=Kboeradio.com|date=July 2, 2019 |access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=Larry |date=December 24, 2018 |title=Jim Reeves: His Untold Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-OGHWrU4HMC&q=jim+reeves+beechcraft+crash&pg=PA617 |publisher=Page Turner Books International |page=574 |isbn=978-0615524306}}</ref>

Reeves made one later recording, however, at the little studio in his home. In late July 1964, a few days before his death in an airplane crash, Reeves recorded "I'm a Hit Again", using just an acoustic guitar as accompaniment.  That recording was never officially  released by RCA Victor (because it was a home recording not owned by the label), but appeared during 2003 as part of a collection of previously unissued Reeves songs released on the VoiceMasters label.

===Personal life===
Jim Reeves married Mary White on September 3, 1947. They never had any children, as Jim Reeves was believed to be [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]], (though not 100% proven) due to complications from a [[mumps]] infection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-mary-reeves-1126808.html|title=Obituary: Mary Reeves|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=November 18, 1999|access-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref>

On July 31, 1964, Reeves and his business partner and manager Dean Manuel (also the pianist of Reeves's backing group, the Blue Boys) left [[Batesville, Arkansas]], en route to Nashville in a single-engine [[Beechcraft]] [[Beechcraft Bonanza#Model 33 Debonair/Bonanza|Debonair]] aircraft, N8972M,<ref name=NTSB>{{cite web |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=79493&key=0 |title=M8972M |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |access-date=August 8, 2019}}</ref> with Reeves at the controls. The two had secured a deal on some real estate.

While flying over [[Brentwood, Tennessee]], they approached a violent thunderstorm. A subsequent investigation showed that once the small airplane became caught in the storm Reeves suffered [[spatial disorientation]]. The singer's widow, Mary Reeves (1929–1999), probably unwittingly started the rumor that he was flying the airplane upside down and assumed he was increasing altitude to clear the storm. However, according to Larry Jordan, author of the 2011 biography, ''Jim Reeves: His Untold Story'', this scenario is rebutted by eyewitnesses known to crash investigators, who saw the plane overhead immediately before the mishap and confirmed that Reeves was not upside down.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=Larry |date=December 24, 2018 |title=Jim Reeves: His Untold Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-OGHWrU4HMC&pg=PA617 |publisher=Page Turner Books International |page=617 |isbn=978-0615524306}}</ref>

Reeves' friend, musician [[Marty Robbins]], recalled hearing the wreck happen and alerting authorities to which direction he heard the impact. Jordan writes extensively about forensic evidence (including from the long-elusive tower tape and accident report), which suggests that instead of making a right turn to avoid the storm (as he had been advised by the approach controller to do), Reeves turned left in an attempt to follow Franklin Road to the airport. In so doing, he flew further into the rain. While preoccupied with trying to re-establish his ground references, Reeves let his airspeed get too low and stalled the aircraft. Relying on his instincts more than his training, evidence suggests he applied full power and pulled back on the yoke before leveling his wings—a fatal, but not uncommon, mistake that induced a stall/spin from which he was too low to recover. Jordan writes that according to the tower tape, Reeves ran into the heavy rain at 4:51&nbsp;pm and crashed only a minute later.

When the wreckage was found some 42 hours later, the airplane's engine and nose was discovered buried in the ground due to the impact of the crash. The crash site was in a wooded area north-northeast of Brentwood, roughly at the junction of Baxter Lane and Franklin Pike Circle, just east of [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|Interstate 65]], and southwest of [[Nashville International Airport]] where Reeves planned to land.

On the morning of August 2, 1964, after an intense search by several parties (which included several personal friends of Reeves, among them [[Ernest Tubb]] and Marty Robbins), the bodies of the singer and Dean Manuel were found in the wreckage of the aircraft, and at 1:00&nbsp;pm local time, radio stations across the United States began to announce Reeves' death formally. Thousands of people traveled to pay their last respects at his funeral two days later. The coffin, draped in flowers from fans, was driven through the streets of Nashville and then to Reeves' final resting place near Carthage, Texas.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Jim Reeves Drive in Carthage, TX IMG 2955.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Jim Reeves Drive at the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]] in [[Carthage, Texas]]]] Reeves was elected posthumously to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] during 1967, which honored him by saying, "The velvet style of 'Gentleman Jim Reeves' was an international influence. His rich voice brought millions of new fans to country music from every corner of the world. Although the crash of his private airplane took his life, posterity will keep his name alive because they will remember him as one of the most important performers in Country music."

In 1998 Reeves was inducted into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]] in Carthage, Texas, where the Jim Reeves Memorial is located. The inscription on the memorial reads, "If I, a lowly singer, dry one tear, or soothe one humble human heart in pain, then my homely verse to God is dear, and not one stanza has been sung in vain."

Each year, the [[Academy of Country Music]] awards the Jim Reeves International Award to an artist who has made an "outstanding contributions to the acceptance of country music throughout the world.done the most to promote the genre worldwide".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acmcountry.com/news?n_id=1574|title=News &#124; Academy Of Country Music Awards|website=Acmcountry.com|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref>

===Posthumous releases===
Reeves' records continued to sell well, both earlier and new albums issued after his death. According to ''Billboard'' magazine, "Reeves' career continued to thrive with hit records on the ''Billboard'' charts throughout the next two decades". The last Reeves song on the chart was "The Image Of Me", in 1984.<ref name="auto1"/>

His widow, Mary, was instrumental in the ongoing success of the songs. She combined unreleased tracks with previous releases (placing updated instrumentals alongside Reeves' original vocals) to produce a regular series of "new" albums after her husband's death. She also operated the Jim Reeves Museum in Nashville from the mid-1970s until 1996. On the 15th anniversary of Reeves death, Mary told a country music magazine interviewer, "Jim Reeves my husband is gone; Jim Reeves the artist lives on."<ref>''Country Song Roundup'', July 1975</ref>

During 1966, Reeves' record "[[Distant Drums (song)|Distant Drums]]" hit number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and remained there for five weeks, beating competition from the Beatles' "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]"/"[[Eleanor Rigby]]" (a double-sided "A" release), and the [[Small Faces]]' song, "[[All or Nothing (Small Faces song)|All Or Nothing]]". The song stayed in the UK chart for 25 weeks, and took number one on the US country music chart. Originally, "Distant Drums" had been recorded merely as a "demo" for its composer, [[Cindy Walker]], believing it was for her personal use and had been deemed "unsuitable" for general release by Chet Atkins and RCA Victor. During 1966, however, RCA determined  a market for the song existed because of the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. It was named Song of the Year in the UK during 1966 by the [[BBC]], and Reeves became the first American artist to receive the accolade. That same year, singer [[Del Reeves]] (no relation) recorded an album paying tribute to him.

In 1980, Reeves was credited with two more top-10 posthumous duet hits, "[[Have You Ever Been Lonely?]]" and "[[I Fall to Pieces]]", which combined separate vocal tracks of both he and the late country star [[Patsy Cline]], who had also passed away in an airplane crash mid-career. Although the two had never recorded together, producers Chet Atkins and [[Owen Bradley]] lifted their isolated vocal performances off original three-track stereo master session tapes, resynchronized them, and combined them with digitally re-recorded backing tracks. The duets first appeared on the ''[[Remembering Patsy Cline & Jim Reeves]]'' LP.

Reeves' compilation albums containing well-known standards continue to sell well. ''The Definitive Collection'' scored number 21 in the UK album charts during July 2003, and ''Memories are Made of This'' reached number 35 during July 2004.

Since 2003, US-based VoiceMasters has issued more than 80 previously unreleased Reeves recordings, including new songs, as well as newly overdubbed material. Among them was "I'm a Hit Again", the last song he recorded in his basement studio just a few days before his death. VoiceMasters overdubbed this track in the same studio in Reeves' former home (then owned{{when|date=February 2024}} by a Nashville record producer{{cn|date=February 2024}}). The song was released in 2008 by H&H Music (UK) and became number one in a survey of radio stations in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=Larry |date=December 24, 2018 |title=Jim Reeves: His Untold Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-OGHWrU4HMC&q=jim+reeves+beechcraft+crash&pg=PA617 |publisher=Page Turner Books International |page=3 |isbn=978-0615524306}}</ref> Reeves' fans repeatedly urged RCA or Bear Family to re-release some of the songs overdubbed during the years after his death which have never appeared on CD.

A compilation CD, ''The Very Best of Jim Reeves'', scored number eight on initial release in the [[UK Albums Chart]] during May 2009, to later score its maximum of number seven during late June, his first top-10 album in the UK since 1992. In 1994, the German [[Bear Family Records]] label released a 16-CD compilation titled ''Welcome to my World'', including more than 75 unissued titles,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bear-family.com/reeves-jim-welcome-to-my-world-16-cd-deluxe-box-set.html|title=Jim Reeves Box set: Welcome To My World (16-CD Deluxe Box Set)|website=Bear-family.com|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref> and many demo recordings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/welcome-to-my-world-bear-family-mw0000180388|title=Welcome to My World [Bear Family] - Jim Reeves &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Jim-Reeves-Welcome-To-My-World/release/7348887|title=Jim Reeves – Welcome To My World (1996, CD)|access-date=August 9, 2021|website=Discogs.com|date=November 29, 1996 }}</ref>

In 2014, a set of eight CDs was released by Intermusic S.A., titled ''The Great Jim Reeves'', containing 170 tracks, remastered and remixed.<ref name="auto1"/>

===Tributes===
Tributes to Reeves were composed in the [[British Isles]] after his death. The song "A Tribute to Jim Reeves" was written by Eddie Masterson, and recorded by [[Larry Cunningham]] and the Mighty Avons; during January 1965, it scored on the UK charts and top 10 in Ireland. It scored the UK charts on December 10, 1964, and was there for 11 weeks and sold 250,000 copies. The Dixielanders Show Band also recorded  "Tribute to Jim Reeves" written by Steve Lynch and recorded during September 1964;  it scored on the [[Northern Ireland]] charts during September 1964. The Masterson song was translated later into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and recorded.

In the UK, "We'll Remember You" was written by Geoff Goddard, but not released until 2008 on the ''Now & Then: From Joe Meek to New Zealand'' double album by Houston Wells.

[[Jerry Jerry and the Sons of Rhythm Orchestra]], a Canadian alternative rock band whose musical style blends elements of surf music, gospel music, rockabilly, garage, and punk, released the song entitled "Jimmy Reeves" on their 1992 album ''Don't Mind If I Do''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jerryjerry.ca/bio.htm|title=Jerry Jerry and the Sons of Rhythm Orchestra – Bio|website=Jerryjerry.ca|access-date=April 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064339/http://www.jerryjerry.ca/bio.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Reeves remains a popular artist in Ireland, and many Irish singers have recorded tribute albums. A play by author Dermot Devitt, ''Put Your Sweet Lips,'' was based on Reeves' appearance in Ireland at the Pavesi Ballroom in [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]] town on June 7, 1963, and reminiscences of people who attended.

Blind [[R&B]] and [[blues]] music artist Robert Bradley (of the band [[Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise]]) paid tribute to Reeves in the album description of his release, ''Out of the Wilderness''. He said, "This record brings me back to the time when I started out wanting to be a singer-songwriter, where the music did not need the [[New York Philharmonic]] to make it real...I wanted to do a record and just be Robert and sing straight like Jim Reeves on 'Put Your Sweet Lips a Little Closer to the Phone'."

British comedian [[Vic Reeves]] adopted his stage name from Reeves and [[Vic Damone]], two of his favorite singers.

In the United States, [[Del Reeves]] (no relation) recorded and released a 1966 album entitled ''Del Reeves Sings Jim Reeves''.

Reeves' nephew, singer-songwriter '''John Rex Reeves''' (March 4, 1936 – November 15, 2022),<ref name="obiJRR">{{cite web |url=https://www.rosewood.cc/book-of-memories/5076717/Reeves-John/obituary.php|title=In Memory of John Rex Reeves 1936 - 2022|date=|accessdate=May 1, 2023|website=Rosewood Funeral Home}}</ref> appeared occasionally on [[RFD-TV]]'s ''Midwest Country,'' singing Reeves' songs, as well as other popular country songs. John Rex, a recording artist in his own right, had two songs on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1981 ("What Would You Do" #93; and "You're the Reason" #90).<ref name="JW">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2|page=346}}</ref> John Rex died after a long illness in [[Kingwood, Texas]], at age 86.<ref name="obiJRR"/>

After their split, Mayer continued to play at local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a minor following. He performed at the 2000 [[South by Southwest]] festival, and was subsequently signed by [[Aware Records]], an imprint of [[Columbia Records]] through which he released his debut [[extended play]] (EP), ''[[Inside Wants Out]]'' (1999). His first two studio albums—''[[Room for Squares]]'' (2001) and ''[[Heavier Things]]'' (2003)—were both met with critical and commercial success; the former won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for its single "[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]", while the latter peaked atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

By 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and further delved into the [[blues]] and rock music which had originally influenced him. Forming the [[John Mayer Trio]], he released the live album, ''[[Try!]]'' (2005) and his third studio album, ''[[Continuum (John Mayer album)|Continuum]]'' (2006). Both were met with positive critical reception, while the latter received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and won both [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for its single, "[[Waiting on the World to Change]]" at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It was followed by ''[[Battle Studies (album)|Battle Studies]]'' (2009) which marked his return to [[pop music|pop]].

After having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles#History|Laurel Canyon]] for the sound of his fifth studio album, ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]'' (2012). Discovery of a [[granuloma]] on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel its accompanying tour. Despite favorable reception and becoming his second release to peak atop the ''Billboard'' 200, the album was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer recovered in January 2013 and released his sixth studio album, ''[[Paradise Valley (album)|Paradise Valley]]'' in August of that year, which peaked at number two on the chart and incorporated [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[Americana (music)|Americana]] influences. His seventh album, ''[[The Search for Everything]]'' (2017) was a loose [[concept album|concept]] based around themes of a romantic break-up. His eighth, ''[[Sob Rock]]'' (2021) was inspired by 1980s [[soft rock]] music.

In 2015, three former members of the [[Grateful Dead]] joined with Mayer and two other musicians to form the band [[Dead & Company]].<ref name=deadtour/> It was the latest of several [[Reunions of the Grateful Dead|reunions]] of the band's surviving members since [[Jerry Garcia]]'s death in 1995.<ref name= NYT-Launch16>{{Citation |date=February 8, 2016 |title=Dead & Company To Launch 2016 Tour |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201602080700PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA17152&feedID=600&press_symbol=3744685 |access-date=April 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420134946/http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201602080700PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA17152&feedID=600&press_symbol=3744685 |archive-date=April 20, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name= Nev11.27.A>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=John |date=December 1, 2015 |title=Review + photos: Dead & Company a tale of two shows in one night at MGM Grand |website=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2015/dec/01/review-photos-dead-company-a-tale-of-two-shows-one/ |access-date=April 8, 2016 |quote="With superb guitar skills and strong vocals on several titles ("West L.A.

;Touring with [[Dead & Company]]
Mayer joined each annual Tour in the years 2015 to the present.

==Other ventures==
===Dead & Company===
{{main|Dead & Company}}
Since 2015, Mayer has been touring with [[Bob Weir]], [[Bill Kreutzmann]] and [[Mickey Hart]] of the [[Grateful Dead]]. Founding bassist [[Phil Lesh]] has notably declined to participate in the project, although he has performed with Mayer on a few occasions since Dead & Company began.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Mayer with Phil Lesh & Friends at Terrapin Crossroads|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/john-mayer-with-phil-lesh-friends-at-terrapin-crossroads|website=Jambase|access-date=September 10, 2018|date=August 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828071145/https://www.jambase.com/article/john-mayer-with-phil-lesh-friends-at-terrapin-crossroads|archive-date=August 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The role of bassist in Dead & Company has instead been played by [[Oteil Burbridge]] of the [[Allman Brothers Band]]. [[Jeff Chimenti]], who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group's keyboardist. 
 
Although Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song ''[[Althea (Grateful Dead song)|Althea]]'' by chance on [[Pandora radio]]. In 2015, while the Dead's ''[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead|Fare Thee Well]]'' shows with [[Trey Anastasio]] were also being planned, Mayer performed "Althea" with Weir on [[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]], along with "[[Truckin']]". Weir was impressed with Mayer's take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016:

{{Blockquote|I was doing preliminary get-togethers with Trey, kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization, John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. They're both explorers, someone who's happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Trey's take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.

I look forward to playing with Trey again, any old time. But I am really eager to get back out with John-boy and chase the music around, get to know each other. When that dream came to me, it was at about that point that I started to realize that I was feeling comfortable with knowing that John had moved, musically speaking – being able to intuit the songs. We were feeling each other out on a new level, several bars down the road.<ref name="FRICKE">{{cite magazine |last1=Fricke |first1=David |title=Bob Weir on Dead & Company's Future, John Mayer's Strengths |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-weir-on-dead-companys-future-john-mayers-classicist-style-50971/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=16 October 2018 |date=31 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828071449/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-weir-on-dead-companys-future-john-mayers-classicist-style-50971/ |archive-date=August 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

The thought of pop singer Mayer stepping in for [[Jerry Garcia]] was met with some initial skepticism by both fans and music critics, but the shows have since been well received.<ref name="uproxx">{{cite web |title=In Praise Of John Mayer's Unlikely Second Life As A Jam Band Hero |url=https://uproxx.com/music/john-mayer-dead-and-company-jam-band-reinvention/ |website=UPROXX |access-date=October 16, 2018 |date=July 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828134359/https://uproxx.com/music/john-mayer-dead-and-company-jam-band-reinvention/ |archive-date=August 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The band continues to tour 2022 and has considered recording a studio album consisting of songs from the Grateful Dead catalog and potentially some originals. In a 2017 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Lesh praised the band's performances and explained his decision not to take part:
{{Blockquote|"I think they're doing a great job. They're bringing the music to the people just like we always wanted to do, and I commend them for it. I hope they're having a good time. It's not something I could do myself, I'm done with that kind of touring.'<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Phil Lesh on Grateful Dead "Long Strange Trip" doc: "it's not the whole story."|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/phil-lesh-on-grateful-dead-doc-long-strange-trip-its-not-the-whole-story-110241/|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=10 September 2018|date=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910095121/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/phil-lesh-on-grateful-dead-doc-long-strange-trip-its-not-the-whole-story-110241/|archive-date=September 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

As social media gained momentum in the 2000s, Mayer became increasingly active online, and maintained four blogs: a [[Myspace]] page, a blog at his official site, another at Honeyee.com, one at [[tumblr]], and a [[photoblog]] at StunningNikon.com.

==Reception==
Mayer was featured on the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' (#1020) in February 2007, along with [[John Frusciante]] and [[Derek Trucks]], in an issue lauding the "New Guitar Gods". The cover nicknamed him Slowhand Jr., a reference to Eric Clapton.<ref name=RSGG/> Critics, however, often pointed to how safe they felt Mayer's music was. Chris Richards, in a review of a 2017 concert, declared Mayer is "an amazing guitar player", albeit doing so "through clenched teeth". Richards went on to say that his talent as a guitarist did not make him exempt from criticism of "his pillow-soft songcraft, the dull sentimentality of his lyrics, or that cuckoo-racist interview he gave to Playboy back in 2010".<ref name="richards">{{cite news |last1=Richards |first1=Chris |title=He's a stellar guitarist, but his songs are staid |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 7, 2017}}</ref> Music writer Steve Baltin commented on this dichotomy, saying that Mayer is "one of the sharpest and savviest musical minds you will ever encounter", and added: "While many have found reasons to dislike Mayer since the beginning of his career, he is a consummate musician's musician, an artist who has been embraced by Eric Clapton, [[Stevie Wonder]] and Buddy Guy among others."<ref name="baltin">{{cite web |last1=Baltin |first1=Steve |title=Why John Mayer Is Music's Forgotten Superstar |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2017/04/22/why-john-mayer-is-musics-forgotten-superstar/ |website=Forbes |access-date=October 16, 2018 |date=April 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016083518/https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2017/04/22/why-john-mayer-is-musics-forgotten-superstar/ |archive-date=October 16, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mayer's inclusion in the line-up of Dead & Company was criticised by [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris Robinson]] of [[The Black Crowes]], who had previously played several shows with The Grateful Dead.

'''John R. Cash''' (born '''J. R. Cash'''; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter.

He traditionally began his concerts by introducing himself with "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash".{{Refn|group="lower-alpha" | Schultz refers to this phrase as Cash's "trademark greeting", and places his utterance of this line, on Cash's ''[[At Folsom Prison]]'' album, "among the most electrifying [seconds] in the history of concert recording."<ref name="Schultz">{{Citation|last=Schultz|first=B.|date=July 1, 2000|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_classic_tracks_johnny|title=Classic Tracks: Johnny Cash's 'Folsom Prison Blues' |newspaper=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]|access-date=March 22, 2010|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102091058/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_classic_tracks_johnny/|archive-date=January 2, 2010}}</ref>}} He began to follow that by "[[Folsom Prison Blues]]", one of his [[signature song]]s. His other signature songs include "[[I Walk the Line]]", "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", "[[Get Rhythm]]", and "[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]".

Her paternal DNA suggested African ancestry in a similar time frame among Johnny Cash's family.<ref name=gates/>  

After meeting with the then-[[laird]] of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] in [[Fife]], Major Michael Crichton-Stuart, Cash became interested in his Scots ancestry.

In March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in [[Dyess, Arkansas]], a [[New Deal]] colony established during the [[Great Depression]] under the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. It was intended to give poor families the opportunity to work land that they might later own.<ref name=Bowden>{{cite news|last1=Bowden|first1=Bill|title=National Register accepts Johnny Cash boyhood home in Arkansas|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|access-date=May 7, 2018|work=ArkansasOnline|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505231153/http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|archive-date=May 5, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> 

From the age of five, Cash worked in cotton fields with his family, singing with them as they worked. Dyess and the Cash farm suffered a flood during his childhood. Later he wrote the song "[[Five Feet High and Rising (song)|Five Feet High and Rising]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=20  |url=https://books.google.com/books |isbn=0-06-072753-5 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression gave him a lifelong sympathy for the poor and working class, and inspired many of his songs.

Cash often spoke of the guilt he felt over the incident. He would say that he looked forward to "meeting [his] brother in Heaven".<ref name="Streissguth_profile" />

Cash's early memories were dominated by [[gospel music]] and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a [[tenor|high-tenor]] voice, before becoming a [[baritone|bass-baritone]] after his [[voice change]]d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gross |first1=Terry |title=All I Did Was Ask: Conversations with Writers, Actors Musicians, and Artists |date=2004 |publisher=[[Hachette Books]] |page=31 |edition=Hardcover}}</ref> 

In high school, he sang on a local Arkansas radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs called ''[[My Mother's Hymn Book]]''. He was also strongly influenced by traditional [[Music of Ireland|Irish music]], which he heard performed weekly by [[Dennis Day]] on the [[Jack Benny]] radio program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Johnny Cash: The 'Fresh Air' Interview |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=503138966 |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=February 27, 2019 |date=November 24, 2016 |quote=And I'd sing Dennis Day songs like. ...Yeah, songs that he sang on the Jack Benny show.

Cash enlisted in the Air Force on July 7, 1950, shortly after the start of the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|first=William|last=Abbott|url=http://www.southernmusic.net/johnnycash.html|title=Johnny Cash&nbsp;– February 26, 1932&nbsp;– September 12, 2003|website=Southernmusic.net|access-date=December 31, 2011}}</ref> After [[basic training]] at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] and technical training at [[Brooks Air Force Base]], both in [[San Antonio, Texas]], Cash was assigned to the 12th Radio Squadron Mobile of the [[U.S. Air Force Security Service]] at [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]], [[West Germany]]. While in San Antonio, he met [[Vivian Cash|Vivian Liberto]], an attractive girl of Sicilian, Irish and German ancestry. They dated briefly before his departure. During the years he served overseas, they exchanged thousands of letters.

He worked in West Germany as a [[Morse code]] operator, intercepting [[Soviet Army]] transmissions. While working this job, Cash was said to be the first American to be given the news of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death (supplied via Morse code).

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
[[File:Johnny Cash Promotional Photo 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Publicity photo for Sun Records, 1955]]
In 1954, Cash and his first wife Vivian moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to "go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell". In a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|newspaper=NPR|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, "[[Hey Porter]]" and "[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.

Cash's next record, "Folsom Prison Blues", made the country top five. His "[[I Walk the Line]]" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. "[[Home of the Blues]]" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Cash felt that Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.

In 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single "[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]" became one of his biggest hits. He recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind such a backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.{{Efn|When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it had also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.}}

Early in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname "the Undertaker" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|title=10 Things you didn't know about Johnny Cash|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=October 31, 2013|archive-date=October 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016134501/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], June, and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]''. It was later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.

Cash's career was handled by [[Saul Holiff]], a [[London, Ontario]], promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com|title=My Father and The Man in Black|website=Johnny-and-saul.com|access-date=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517093414/http://johnny-and-saul.com/|archive-date=May 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Outlaw image ===
As his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his "nervousness" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].

Although he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by [[June Carter]]'s sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash.<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles|10|3}}</ref> He said that it had come to him in a dream. 

His first wife Vivian (Liberto) Cash claimed a different version of the origins of "Ring of Fire". In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'' (2007), Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Vivian |last2=Sharpsteen |first2=Ann |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1416532927 |page=294 |edition=Hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmkBUE0f3HAC&pg=PA294 |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>

In June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California. It set off a forest fire that burned several hundred acres and nearly caused his death.<ref>"Major brush fire."

''Los Angeles Times'', June 29, 1965, p. 27.</ref> Cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper, but Fielder thought that Cash started a fire to stay warm and, under the influence of drugs, failed to notice the fire getting out of control.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hilburn|first1=Robert|title=Johnny Cash: The Life|year=2013|publisher=Little, Brown and Company| edition=ebook|isbn=978-0-316-19475-4}}</ref> When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, "I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it."<ref>Hilburn, 2013 (ebook)</ref>

Although Cash cultivated a romantic [[outlaw]] image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he was held only one night each time. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this incident as the basis for the song "Starkville City Jail". He discussed this on his live ''At San Quentin'' album.)<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[At San Quentin]]'', [[Columbia Records]] CS 9827, 1969</ref> 

While on tour later that year, he was arrested October 4 in [[El Paso, Texas]], by a [[narcotic]]s squad. The officers suspected he was [[smuggling]] [[heroin]] from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules (amphetamines) and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, Cash received a [[suspended sentence]]. He posted a $1,500 bond and was released until his arraignment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219065356/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 19, 2013|title=Johnny Cash's dark California days|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=October 12, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

In this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s. His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. 

In 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.

Reaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash and his first wife divorced after having separated in 1962. Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]", won a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22johnny+cash%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All/|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

Cash was last arrested in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills when in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> 

Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: "I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me."<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref> June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in [[Franklin, Kentucky]]. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had "cleaned up."<ref>{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone: The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music|url=https://archive.org/details/willyoumissmewhe0000zwon|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-85763-3}}</ref>

Cash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an "[[altar call]]" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend [[Hank Snow]]. According to [[Marshall Grant]], though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968; and did not fully end drug use for another two years. He was drug-free for a period of seven years. In his memoir about time with Cash, Grant said that the birth of Cash's son, [[John Carter Cash]], inspired the singer to end his dependence.<ref name="Grant page 92">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92 92, 177]|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92}}</ref>

Cash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was deeply addicted again. He entered rehab at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]] for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. 

In 1989, he entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he started care at the Loma Linda Behavioral Medicine Center in [[Loma Linda, California]], for his final rehabilitation treatment. (Several months later, his son followed him into this facility for treatment.)<ref name=Grant>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars}}</ref><ref name="John Carter Cash">{{cite book|last=Cash|first=John Carter|title=Anchored in Love|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8499-0187-4}}</ref>

=== Folsom and other prison concerts ===
In the late 1950s Cash began performing concerts at prisons. He played his first notable prison concert on January 1, 1958, at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in California.<ref name="cash1958">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/inmate-merle-haggard-hears-johnny-cash-play-san-quentin-state-prison "Inmate Merle Haggard hears Johnny Cash play San Quentin State Prison"], history.com; accessed June 24, 2014.</ref> These performances were recorded live, and released on highly successful albums: ''[[At Folsom Prison|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison]]'' (1968) and ''[[At San Quentin|Johnny Cash at San Quentin]]'' (1969). Both live albums reached number one on ''Billboard'' country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the ''Billboard'' pop album chart. In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even [[The Beatles]] by selling 6.5&nbsp;million albums.<ref>Edwards, Leigh H. "Cash, Johnny." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as ''Strawberry Cake'' recorded in London and ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.

The [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his "Folsom Prison Blues", while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single "[[A Boy Named Sue]]", a [[Shel Silverstein]] novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. [[Top 40|top-10]] pop charts.

In 1972 Cash performed at the [[Österåker Prison]] in Sweden. The live album ''[[På Österåker]]'' (''At Österåker'') was released in 1973. "San Quentin" was recorded with Cash replacing "San Quentin" with "Österåker". In 1976, a concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]] was videotaped for TV broadcast. It was posthumously released after Cash's death as a CD entitled ''[[A Concert Behind Prison Walls]]''.

=== Activism for Native Americans ===
Cash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Johnny Cash and the paradox of American Identity|last=Edwards|first=Leigh|publisher=Bloomington : Indiana University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-253-35292-7}}</ref> Cash sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S. government.

{{blockquote|In '57, I wrote a song called "Old Apache Squaw" and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.<ref>{{cite episode |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny| title=Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash |series=[[Rainbow Quest]] |season=1 |number=39 |year=1966}}</ref>}}

Columbia Music, the label for which Cash was recording then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it "too radical for the public".<ref>Cash, J., & Carr, P. (1997). ''Cash: The autobiography'' (p. 408). San Francisco, CA: HarperSanFrancisco.</ref> Cash singing songs of Indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country music in the 1950s, which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy who makes the native's soil his own.<ref>Tahmahkera, D. (2011). Volume 63. In ''American Quarterly'' (p. 597). Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

In 1964, coming off the chart success of his previous album ''[[I Walk the Line (1964 album)|I Walk the Line]]'', he recorded the aforementioned album ''[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian]]''.

The album featured stories of a multitude of Indigenous peoples, emphasizing their violent oppression by white settlers: the [[Pima people]] ("The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]"), [[Navajo]] ("Navajo"), [[Apache]] ("Apache Tears"), [[Lakota people|Lakota]] ("Big Foot"), [[Seneca people|Seneca]] ("As Long as the Grass Shall Grow"), and [[Cherokee]] ("The Talking Leaves"). Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one with the help of [[Johnny Horton]]. 

The majority of these protest songs were written by folk artist [[Peter La Farge]] (son of [[Oliver La Farge]], an activist and Pulitzer prizewinner.) Cash met the younger La Farge in New York in the 1960s and admired him for his activism.<ref>{{cite web|date=1965|title=Johnny Cash and June Carter (Television series episode). In Rainbow Quest.

([[Ira Hayes]] was a Native American who was one of the six soldiers featured in a photo raising the U.S. flag at [[Iwo Jima]] during World War II.)

The record label denied it promotion due to what it considered a provocative and "unappealing" nature. Cash faced resistance and was urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the [[Country Music Association]], who said: "You and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks, country artists, and country DJs."<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2009/11/09/johnny_cash_2/|title=The bitter tears of Johnny Cash|date=November 9, 2009|website=Salon.com|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>

In reaction, on August 22, 1964, Cash posted a letter as an advertisement in [[Billboard Magazine|''Billboard'']], calling the record industry cowardly: "D.J.s – station managers – owners{{nbsp}}[...] where are your guts? I had to fight back when I realized that so many stations are afraid of Ira Hayes. Just one question: WHY???

Later, on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', he continued telling stories of Native-American plight, both in song and through short films, such as the history of the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1970|title=[Television series episode].

===''The Johnny Cash Show''===
From June 1969 to March 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/08/10/johnny-cashs-excellent-music-variety-tv-show-ran-58-episodes-but-was-canceled-in-a-rural-purge/|title=Johnny Cash's excellent music variety TV show ran 58 episodes but was canceled in a "rural purge"|date=August 10, 2017|work=The Vintage News|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Produced by [[Screen Gems]], the show was performed at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville. [[The Statler Brothers]] opened for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend Carl Perkins were also part of the regular show entourage. Cash also enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including [[Linda Ronstadt]] in her first TV appearance, [[Neil Young]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition]] (who appeared four times), [[James Taylor]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=":0" />

Cash had first met with Dylan in the mid-1960s and became neighbors in the late 1960s in [[Woodstock, New York]]. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan, "[[Girl from the North Country]]", on Dylan's country album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' and also wrote the album's [[Grammy]]-winning [[liner notes]].

Another artist who received a major career boost from ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was [[Kris Kristofferson]], who was beginning to make a name for himself as a singer-songwriter. During a live performance of Kristofferson's "[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]", Cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] intact:

{{poemquote|On a Sunday morning sidewalk

The closing program of ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was a gospel music special. Guests included the [[The Blackwood Brothers|Blackwood Brothers]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Stuart Hamblen]], and [[Billy Graham]].<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash'', Relevant Books, 2003, p. 91.</ref>

=== The "Man in Black" ===
[[File:President Richard Nixon and Johnny Cash.jpg|thumb|Cash advocated [[prison reform]] at his July 1972 meeting with President [[Richard Nixon]]]]

By the early 1970s, Cash had established his public image as the "Man in Black". He regularly performed in entirely black suits with a long, black, knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the [[rhinestone]] suits and [[cowboy boots]] worn by most of the major country acts of his day.

[[File:Johnny-Cash 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Cash performing in [[Bremen]], West Germany, in September 1972]]
Cash said he wore all black on behalf of the poor and hungry, the "prisoner who has long paid for his crime", and those who have been betrayed by age or drugs.<ref name="85-86">{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |pages= 85–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> He added, "With the [[Vietnam War]] as painful in my mind as it was in most other Americans, I wore it 'in mourning' for the lives that could have been'&nbsp;... Apart from the Vietnam War being over, I don't see much reason to change my position&nbsp;... The old are still neglected, the poor are still poor, the young are still dying before their time, and we're not making many moves to make things right. There's still plenty of darkness to carry off."<ref name="85-86"/>

[[File:One piece at a time.jpg|thumb|right|Cash in the "one piece at a time" Cadillac]]
Initially, he and his band had worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color.<ref name="Page 64"/> The outdated [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|US Navy's winter blue uniform]] used to be referred to by sailors as "Johnny Cashes", as the uniform's shirt, tie, and trousers are solid black.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.navytimes.com/legacy/new/0-NAVYPAPER-356961.php|title=The good, bad and ugly of proposed uniforms|newspaper=[[Navy Times]]|date=October 4, 2004}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Cash's popularity and number of hit songs began to decline. He made commercials for [[Amoco]] and [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]], an unpopular enterprise at the time of the [[1970s energy crisis]]. In 1976, he made commercials for [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel Trains]], for which he also wrote the music.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lionel Trains: A Pictorial History of Trains and Their Collectors|page=19|author=Turner Publishing|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|year=2004|isbn=978-1-56311-958-3}}</ref> However, his first autobiography, ''Man in Black'', was published in 1975 and sold 1.3&nbsp;million copies. A second, ''Cash: The Autobiography'', appeared in 1997.

Cash's friendship with [[Billy Graham]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Allmond, Joy|date=September 13, 2015|title=Johnny Cash's Faith and Friendship with Billy Graham|publisher=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|url=https://billygraham.org/story/johnny-cashs-faith-and-friendship-with-billy-graham/}}</ref> led to his production of a film about the life of Jesus, ''[[Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus]]'', which Cash co-wrote and narrated. It was released in 1973. Cash viewed the film as a statement of his personal faith rather than a means of proselytizing.<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash.'' Relevant Books, 2003, p. 117.</ref>

Cash and June Carter Cash appeared several times on the ''Billy Graham Crusade'' TV specials, and Cash continued to include gospel and religious songs on many of his albums, though Columbia declined to release ''[[A Believer Sings the Truth]]'', a gospel double-LP Cash recorded in 1979 and which ended up being released on an independent label even with Cash still under contract to Columbia. On November 22, 1974, CBS ran his one-hour TV special entitled'' Riding The Rails'', a musical history of trains.

He continued to appear on television, hosting Christmas specials on [[CBS]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Later television appearances included a starring role in an episode of ''[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 3|Columbo]]'', entitled "Swan Song". June and he appeared in an episode of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', entitled "The Collection". He gave a performance as abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in the 1985 [[American Civil War]] television miniseries ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]''. In the 1990s, Johnny and June appeared in ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' in recurring roles.

He was friendly with every US president, starting with [[Richard Nixon]]. He was closest to [[Jimmy Carter]], with whom he became close friends and who was a distant cousin of his wife, June.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

Cash declined to play the first two and instead selected other songs, including "The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]" and his own compositions, "[[What Is Truth]]" and "Man in Black". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=304 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn= 9780062515001 |edition=hardcover| access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed "antihippie and antiblack" sentiments might have backfired.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page= 212 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> In his remarks when introducing Cash, Nixon joked that one thing he had learned about him was one did not tell him what to sing.<ref>[[Richard Nixon]], April 17, 1970, released on Johnny Cash, ''Bootleg Vol. III: Live Around the World'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]]/Legacy 88697 93033 2), released 2011</ref>

=== Highwaymen and departure from Columbia Records ===
[[File:Highwaymen.jpg|thumb|[[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] members [[Kris Kristofferson]], Johnny Cash, [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]]]]
In 1980, Cash became the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]'s youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s, his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;– The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.

During that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County (film)|Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life [[Murder in Coweta County|Georgia murder]] case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis.

Cash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an [[ostrich]] on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005}}</ref>

At a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a "[[near-death experience]]".

{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}
In 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled "[[The Chicken in Black]]" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash – who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as "A Boy Named Sue" and "One Piece at a Time" – accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked "like a buffoon" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores—interrupting its bona fide chart success—and termed the venture "a fiasco".<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 500–502</ref>

Between 1981 and 1984, he recorded several sessions with famed [[countrypolitan]] producer [[Billy Sherrill]] (who also produced "The Chicken in Black"), which were shelved; they would be released by Columbia's sister label, [[Legacy Recordings]], in 2014 as ''[[Out Among the Stars]]''.<ref name="ats">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-lost-album-out-among-the-stars-20131210,0,2223681.story|title='Lost' Early-'80s Johnny Cash Album Slated for March 25 Release|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=December 10, 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Around this time, Cash also recorded [[Believe in Him|an album of gospel recordings]] that ended up being released by another label around the time of his departure from Columbia (this due to Columbia closing down its Priority Records division that was to have released the recordings).

After more unsuccessful recordings were released between 1984 and 1985, Cash left Columbia.

In 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with [[Roy Orbison]], Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''; according to Hilburn, Columbia still had Cash under contract at the time, so special arrangements had to be made to allow him to participate.<ref>Hilburn, p. 506</ref> Also in 1986, Cash published his only novel, ''Man in White'', a book about [[Paul the Apostle|Saul]] and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. He recorded ''Johnny Cash Reads The Complete [[New Testament]]'' in 1990.

=== ''American Recordings'' ===
[[File:Johnny Cash sings a duet with a Navy lieutenant.jpg|thumb|Johnny Cash sings with a Navy lieutenant during a military event {{circa}} January 1987]]
After Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with [[Mercury Records]] from 1987 to 1991. During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.

Though Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death, his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a "morale booster"; Rosanne Cash later said "he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it". The album attracted press attention on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/28/johnny-cash-indie-1980s-resurrection |title=The Resurrection of Johnny Cash |last=Thomson |first=Graeme |date=April 28, 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> In 1991, he sang a version of "Man in Black" for the [[Christian punk]] band [[One Bad Pig]]'s album ''I Scream Sunday''. In 1993, he sang "[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]", the closing track of [[U2]]'s album ''[[Zooropa]]''. According to ''Rolling Stone'' writer Adam Gold, "The Wanderer" – written for Cash by Bono, "defies both the U2 and Cash canons, combining rhythmic and textural elements of Nineties synth-pop with a Countrypolitan lament fit for the closing credits of a Seventies western."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Gold |first1=Adam |title=How U2 Fell in Love with Nashville and Influenced Today's Country Music |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-u2s-love-affair-with-nashville-country-music-w491992 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 26, 2019 |date=July 13, 2017 |archive-date=December 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209095057/http://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-u2s-love-affair-with-nashville-country-music-w491992 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

No longer sought-after by major labels, he was offered a contract with producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] label, which had recently been rebranded from Def American, under which name it was better known for rap and [[hard rock]].

The album had a great deal of critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 [[Glastonbury Festival]] was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and commercial success. He teamed up with [[Brooks & Dunn]] to contribute "Folsom Prison Blues" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. On the same album, he performed Bob Dylan's  "[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Cash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the television series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. He also lent his voice for a [[cameo role]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)]]", as the "Space Coyote" that guides [[Homer Simpson]] on a spiritual quest.

Cash was joined by guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] of [[Soundgarden]], bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] of [[Alice in Chains]] for a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Red Headed Stranger|Time of the Preacher]]", featured on the tribute album ''Twisted Willie'', released in January 1996.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-01-27-ca-29172-story.html |title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP : 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=January 27, 1996 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 1996, Cash collaborated with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] on ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'' (also known as ''American Recordings II''), which won the [[Best Country Album]] Grammy in 1998. The album was produced by Rick Rubin with [[Sylvia Massy]] engineering and mixing. A majority of ''Unchained'' was recorded at [[Sound City Studios]] and featured guest appearances by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], and [[Marty Stuart]]. Believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography ''Man in Black'', he wrote ''Cash: The Autobiography'' in 1997.

Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 568–570</ref> The diagnosis was later again altered to [[Dysautonomia|autonomic neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]]. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe [[pneumonia]], which damaged his lungs.

During the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'' (2000) and ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' (2002). ''American IV'' included [[Cover version|cover songs]] by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably "[[Hurt (Johnny Cash song)|Hurt]]" by [[Nine Inch Nails]] and "[[Personal Jesus]]" by [[Depeche Mode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/|title=Johnny Cash, ''American IV: The Man Comes Around''|last=Carr|first=Eric|date=November 7, 2002|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=May 12, 2017}}</ref> [[Trent Reznor]] of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash's plan to cover "Hurt", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |title=Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor |magazine=Alternative Press |date=June 26, 2004 |access-date=October 15, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015203101/http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |archive-date=October 15, 2017 }}</ref> The video for "Hurt" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos – Johnny Cash, Hurt|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085375,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214843/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085375,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 26, 2011|magazine=Time|access-date=August 19, 2011|first=Glen|last=Levy| date=July 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|url=https://www.nme.com/list/100-greatest-music-videos/217342/page/10|publisher=[[NME]]|access-date=December 15, 2012|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>

He even performed surprise shows at the [[Carter Family Fold]] outside [[Bristol, Virginia]]. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing "Ring of Fire", Cash read a statement that he had written shortly before taking the stage:

{{blockquote|The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She's never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart.}}

Cash continued to record until shortly before his death. "When June died, it tore him up", Rick Rubin recalled. "He said to me, 'You have to keep me working because I will die if I don't have something to do.' He was in a wheelchair by then and we set him up at his home in Virginia… I couldn't listen to those recordings for two years after he died and it was heartbreaking when he died."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The Q Interview: Rick Rubin|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=October 2009|page=98}}</ref> Cash's final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of "Like the 309", which appeared on ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' in 2006, and the final song he completed, "Engine 143", recorded for his son John Carter Cash's planned Carter Family tribute album.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of [[love letter]]s.{{Sfn|Turner|2004|pp=43–44}} On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. They had four daughters: [[Rosanne Cash|Rosanne]], Kathy, [[Cindy Cash|Cindy]], and Tara. In 1961, Cash moved his family to a hilltop home overlooking [[Casitas Springs, California]]. He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement. Liberto later said that she had filed for divorce in 1966 because of Cash's severe drug and alcohol abuse, as well as his constant touring, his repeated acts of [[adultery]] with other women, and his close relationship with singer [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]]. Their four daughters were then raised by their mother.

Cash met June of the famed [[Carter Family]] while on tour, and the two became infatuated with each other. In 1968, thirteen years after they first met backstage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], Cash proposed to June, during a live performance in [[London, Ontario]].<ref>{{Citation|place=London, UK|last=Sweeting|first=Adam|date=September 12, 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/sep/12/johnnycash|type=Obituary|title=Johnny Cash|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=January 26, 2009}}</ref> The couple married on March 1, 1968, in [[Franklin, Kentucky]]. They had one child together, [[John Carter Cash]], born March 3, 1970. He was the only son for both Johnny and June. In addition to having his four daughters and John Carter, Cash also became stepfather to [[Carlene Carter|Carlene]] and [[Rosie Nix Adams|Rosie]], June's daughters from her first two marriages, to, respectively, [[honky-tonk]] singer [[Carl Smith (musician)|Carl Smith]], and former police officer, football player, and race-car driver Edwin "Rip" Nix. Cash and Carter continued to work, raise their child, create music, and tour together for 35 years until June's death in May 2003. Throughout their marriage, June attempted to keep Cash off [[amphetamines]], often taking his drugs and flushing them down the toilet. June remained with him even throughout his multiple admissions for rehabilitation treatment and decades of [[drug addiction]]. After June's death in May 2003, Cash believed that his only reason for living was his music; he died only four months later.<ref>Puterbaugh, Parke. "Essential Johnny Cash."

Cash nurtured and defended artists (such as Bob Dylan<ref name="pc10" />) on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment's most visible symbol. At an all-star concert which aired in 1999 on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Dylan, [[Chris Isaak]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Norah Jones]], Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, [[Dom DeLuise]], and U2. Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year. Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; ''[[Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash|Kindred Spirits]]'' contains works from established artists, while ''[[Dressed in Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash|Dressed in Black]]'' contains works from many lesser-known musicians.

In total, he wrote over 1,000 songs and released dozens of albums. A [[box set]] titled ''[[Unearthed (Johnny Cash album)|Unearthed]]'' was issued posthumously. It included four CDs of unreleased material recorded with Rubin, as well as a ''Best of Cash on American'' retrospective CD.

Cash received multiple [[Country Music Association Awards]], Grammys, and other awards, in categories ranging from vocal and spoken performances to album notes and videos. In a career that spanned almost five decades, Cash was the personification of country music to many people around the world. Cash was a musician who was not defined by a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]], and exerted an influence on each of those genres.

His diversity was evidenced by his presence in five major music halls of fame: the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1980), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992), GMA's [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2010). and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] (2013).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/johnny-cash|publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash|access-date=May 2, 2017|archive-date=May 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504125420/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/johnny-cash|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/johnny-cash|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash}}</ref> Marking his death in 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' stated other than [[Elvis Presley]] Cash was the only artist inducted as a performer into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<ref name="RS Cash">{{cite news |title=Johnny Cash: Remembering the Incomparable Legend of Country, Rock and Roll |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/johnny-cash-remembering-the-incomparable-legend-of-country-rock-and-roll-244037/ |access-date=April 1, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

'''Lee Roy Parnell''' (born December 21, 1956) is an American [[country music]] and [[blues]] artist, singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Active since 1990, he has recorded eight studio albums, and has charted more than twenty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. His highest-charting hits are "[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]" (1992), "[[Tender Moment]]" (1993), and "[[A Little Bit of You (Lee Roy Parnell song)|A Little Bit of You]]" (1995), all of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2. Four more of his singles have charted in the Top Ten as well. Parnell made a shift in the early 2000s back to the bluesier sounds of his early works, releasing two blues albums on [[Vanguard Records]] and [[Universal South]]. Besides his own work, Parnell has played [[slide guitar]] and [[National String Instrument Corporation|National guitar]] on several other country and blues recordings.

==Early years==
Parnell was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], but raised in [[Stephenville, Texas]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Landon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22lee+roy+parnell%22&pg=PA359|date=July 14, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|pages=359–360|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref> His father had performed with [[Bob Wills]], and Parnell gave his first performance at age six on Wills' radio show.<ref name="allmusic"/> Parnell played guitar and drums in various bands during his teenage years. He joined [[Kinky Friedman]]'s [[Texas Jewboys]] in his late teens and moved to Austin in 1974 to join the city's budding music scene. <ref name="allmusic"/> He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1987, and he signed with the [[Arista Nashville]] recording company two years later.<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

==Career==
===''Lee Roy Parnell''===
Parnell released his [[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|self-titled debut album]] for [[Arista Records]] in 1990.<ref name="Rusty Russell 2009">Rusty Russell.  "Lee Roy Parnell: A Nashville hitmaker breaks out. " Guitar Player  December 1, 2001: General Interest Module, ProQuest. Web.  July 14, 2009.</ref> This album produced three chart singles in "Crocodile Tears", "Oughta Be a Law" and "Family Tree", none of which charted in the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. A video for "Mexican Money" was created and released, but the song was not released to radio.

===''Love Without Mercy''===
''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' was Parnell's breakthrough album, released in 1992. Although its lead-off single "The Rock" fell short of Top 40, the next three singles all reached Top Ten:<ref name="allmusic"/> "[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]" at No.&nbsp;2, the title track at No.&nbsp;8, and finally "Tender Moment" also at No.&nbsp;2. These three were also Top Ten hits on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts in Canada.

===''On the Road''===
1993's ''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'', Parnell's third album for the Arista label, also produced two top-10 hits: the [[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell song)|title track]] and "I'm Holding My Own", at No.&nbsp;6 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively. The album also contained a No.&nbsp;17-peaking rendition of the [[Hank Williams]] song "Take These Chains from My Heart", which Parnell recorded as a duet with [[Ronnie Dunn]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], although Dunn was not credited on the chart. The final single from ''On the Road'', "The Power of Love", peaked at No.&nbsp;51.

===''We All Get Lucky Sometimes''===
Parnell's fourth album, 1995's ''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'', was also his first for Career Records, then a newly formed subsidiary of [[Arista Nashville]]. This album's lead-off single "A Little Bit of You" was the third single of his career to reach No.&nbsp;2. Following it were the No.&nbsp;12 "When a Woman Loves a Man" (featuring background vocals by [[Trisha Yearwood]]), the No.&nbsp;3 "Heart's Desire" and another No.&nbsp;12 in "Giving Water to a Drowning Man". The album's title track, which was its fifth single, peaked at No.&nbsp;46.

===''Every Night's a Saturday Night'' and ''Hits and Highways Ahead''===
''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' was Parnell's final release for Career Records. This was his first album since his debut release that did not produce a Top Ten hit, and only three singles were released from it: "Lucky Me, Lucky You" at No.&nbsp;35, "You Can't Get There From Here" at No.&nbsp;39 (his final Top 40 hit), and "All That Matters Anymore" at No.&nbsp;50. After Career Records was merged back into Arista Nashville, Parnell released his final album for the Arista label, 1999's ''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]''. This album's only single, "She Won't Be Lonely Long", peaked at No.&nbsp;57, and by the year's end, Parnell exited Arista's roster.

===''Tell the Truth'', ''Back to the Well'' and ''Midnight Believer''===
In 2000 Parnell signed to [[Vanguard Records]]<ref name="Rusty Russell 2009"/> and released the album ''Tell the Truth''. This album's only single, "South by Southwest", failed to chart, and he soon left the label as well. Parnell's next album, ''Back to the Well'', came in 2006 on [[Universal South Records]], although it also produced only one non-charting single in "Daddies and Daughters."

==External contributions==
Besides playing [[slide guitar]] and [[National guitar]] on his albums and co-writing several of his own songs, Parnell has co-written two Top 40 country hits for other artists: "Too Much" by [[Pirates of the Mississippi]] and "[[That's My Story (song)|That's My Story]]" by [[Collin Raye]], from 1992 and 1993 respectively. In 1994, he and [[Steve Wariner]] collaborated with [[Diamond Rio]] on a cover of [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[Workin' Man's Blues]]", credited to Jed Zeppelin and recorded for a tribute album ''[[Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard]]''. This rendition peaked at No.&nbsp;48 on the country charts. He played slide guitar on [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]'s late-1994 Number One hit "[[Shut Up and Kiss Me (Mary Chapin Carpenter song)|Shut Up and Kiss Me]]", and appeared in the song's music video. Parnell added slide guitar to [[Delbert McClinton]]'s "Sending Me Angels" in 1997, and in late 2004, he was credited with playing slide guitar on [[David Lee Murphy]]'s No.&nbsp;46-peaking single "Inspiration", from the album ''[[Tryin' to Get There]]''.

'''William Orville''' "'''Lefty'''" '''Frizzell''' (March 31, 1928 &ndash; July 19, 1975) was an American [[country music|country]] and [[honky-tonk]] singer-songwriter.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=494/5}}</ref>

Frizell is known as one of the most influential country music vocal stylists of all time. He has been cited as influencing prominent country singers like [[George Jones]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Willie Nelson]]. He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1982 as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In his prime, Frizzell was the first artist to achieve four songs in the top ten on the Country Music Billboard charts at one time. Frizzell went on to have more success, releasing many songs that charted in the Top 10 of the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts as an artist and songwriter. After dealing with alcoholism, he died of a stroke at age 47.

==Early life==
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2022}}

William Orville Frizzell was born the son of an oilman, the first of eight children, in [[Corsicana, Texas|Corsicana]] in [[Navarro County, Texas|Navarro County]] in [[North Texas]], United States.<ref name="Larkin"/> During his childhood, his family moved to [[El Dorado, Arkansas|El Dorado]] in [[Union County, Arkansas|Union County]] in south [[Arkansas]].<ref name="Larkin"/>

As a child he was called "Sonny," but he later took the name "Lefty." It was believed that he got the name "Lefty" because he had won a neighborhood fight; however, this tale was probably fabricated as part of a publicity stunt set up by his record label.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Frizzell's largest influences included "The Blue Yodeler" [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].<ref name="Larkin"/> He began listening to Rodgers' records as a boy. He began singing professionally before his teens, even earning a spot on the local radio-station KELD in El Dorado, Arkansas.<ref name="Larkin"/> Frizzell's teens were spent singing in nightclubs and radio and talent shows throughout the south. During his tour of [[Arkansas]], Texas, [[New Mexico]], and [[Las Vegas]], he began to develop a style of his own, shaped by artists like Rodgers, [[Ernest Tubb]], and [[Ted Daffan]].

== Musical beginnings and jail ==

While living in [[Greenville, Texas]], during [[World War II]], Frizzell performed on radio station KPLT in nearby [[Paris, Texas]]. There he met Alice Harper; they married in March 1945. In 1946, they moved to [[Roswell, New Mexico]], and Frizzell performed on radio station KGFL and with the house band at the Cactus Gardens dance hall.

In July 1947, the 19-year-old Frizzell was arrested and jailed for having sex with an underage fan. He was charged with statutory rape, convicted the following month, and served six months in the county jail. Filled with guilt, he wrote poems to his wife from his cell; one of them would become his first big record.<ref name="Lefty Frizzell">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/lefty-frizzell | title=Lefty Frizzell }}</ref>

After his release in late 1949, he was led away from music, and back to the oil fields to work with his father. However, soon he was performing in nightclubs again. By 1950, he had landed a regular job at the [[Big Spring, Texas]], nightclub "Ace of Clubs" where he developed a dedicated fan following.

==Recording career ==
[[File:Lefty Frizzell Columbia publicity - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Frizzell in 1951]]
During a show at the "Ace of Clubs", [[Jim Beck (record producer)|Jim Beck]], the owner of a Dallas recording studio, took notice of Frizzell. Beck had deals with several major record producing labels and maintained connections with many publishers. Impressed with Frizzell's performance, he invited him to make a free demo at the studio. In April 1950, he cut several demos of Frizzell singing his own songs, including "[[If You've Got the Money (I've Got the Time)]]," which Beck took to Nashville where he pitched it to [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], who disliked the song. However, [[Columbia Records]] producer [[Don Law]] heard the cut and liked it. After hearing Lefty in concert, he signed the singer and recorded him for the first time.

"If You've Got the Money (I've Got the Time)" became a two-sided smash hit in 1950 upon its release; the b-side was the song Frizzell wrote to his grief-stricken wife Alice from jail, "I Love You A Thousand Ways."<ref name="Larkin"/> These songs launched him into stardom and within two years, he had gone to register 13 Top 10 Country hits.<ref name="Larkin"/>

By 1951, he had perfected his vocal style and refined his guitar skills. He began working with a core group of Dallas-based studio musicians, including pianist Madge Suttee. In January 1951 he signed a contract that designated Jack Starnes Jr. as his manager. That contract conflicted with another contract Frizzell had signed, leading Starnes to file a major lawsuit against Frizzell, which was settled out of court a year later.<ref name="Lefty Frizzell"/>  Also in early 1951, Frizzell formed the Western Cherokees, led by Blackie Crawford, and soon they became his primary band for both live and recording sessions. During this stage of his career, he was in the studio extensively, recording singles. His third single, "[[I Want to Be With You Always]]", was No. 1 for 11 weeks in 1951.

By mid-1951, Frizzell had become one of the only country singers who could be considered to match the popularity of Hank Williams, and he even toured with Williams. "There is enough stories in that tour to fill a book..." Frizzell once said, although he never told those stories. He had three more Top 10 hits in 1951; "Mom and Dad's Waltz," "Travelin' Blues," and the #1 hit "Give Me More, More, More (Of Your Kisses)."  In August 1951, he was arrested backstage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor; the charge stemmed from a liaison in Arkansas during his tour with Williams. The charges were dropped and Frizzell was never prosecuted.<ref name="Lefty Frizzell"/>

By 1952, he was a popular stage performer and in heavy demand, being included on The Grand Ole Opry and [[The Louisiana Hayride]] multiple times throughout the 1950s. The hits continued throughout 1952, with "How Long Will It Take (To Stop Loving You)," "Don't Stay Away ('Till Love Grows Cold)", "Forever (And Always)", and "I'm An Old, Old Man (Try'n'a Live While I Can)".

Despite his massive success, things began to go downhill for Frizzell. He fired his manager and band, and joined the Grand Ole Opry; however, he quit very soon thereafter.<ref name="Larkin"/> Even though he was earning a lot of money, he was spending almost all of it. He began to work with the Arkansas-born singer-songwriter [[Wayne Raney]], but the sessions were considered a failure.

Frizell had an automobile accident in 1952, moved to Los Angeles in early 1953, and earned a spot as a regular cast member on the [[Town Hall Party]] television show on KTTV.<ref name="Larkin"/> His songs still charted, but only one entered the Top 10 that year.

In January 1954, Frizzell had another automobile accident, near [[E.S. Richardson Elementary School]] in [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]], Louisiana, through which he passed after leaving the [[Louisiana Hayride]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] en route to a concert in [[Mississippi]].  His [[Cadillac]] struck the [[Nash Motors|Nash]] [[station wagon]] parked at the home of its owner, [[R. Harmon Drew, Sr.]], the former city judge and later a member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]. Frizzell apologized, said that he hoped to visit Minden again under more favorable circumstances, posted [[Bail bondsman|bond]], and took a [[taxicab]] back to Shreveport, from which he flew to his destination.<ref>Reggie Ward, "Folk Singer Gets Blues Here", ''Minden Herald'', January 29, 1954, pp. 1, 12</ref> In early 1954, he reached the Top 10 for the last time for five years.

Having had few hits in the middle-late 1950s, he felt burnt out and had little energy for his career. He became frustrated that [[Columbia Records]] did not release what he thought to be his best material, so he stopped writing and recording songs.<ref name="Larkin"/> He toured extensively, however. 

In 1959, deciding on change, Frizell began to work at Nashville's Cedarwood Publishing Company  with [[Jim Denny (Opry manager)|Jim Denny]]. His first Top 10 hit in five years came with "[[Long Black Veil]]" that year.<ref name="Larkin"/> He moved to Nashville in 1960 after the Town Hall Party closed, and began touring and recording more and more, scoring some minor hits.

Lefty's last big hit came in 1964 with the No. 1 song "[[Saginaw, Michigan (song)|Saginaw, Michigan]]", which earned him a Grammy nomination.<ref name="Larkin"/> The next year, "[[She's Gone, Gone, Gone]]" was his last Top 20 hit. However, "I Never Go Around Mirrors" from his last studio album ''The Legendary'' is considered one of the greatest country songs of all time.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&dq=I+never+go+around+mirrors+greatest+country+song+of+all+time&pg=PA506 | isbn=978-0-87930-475-1 | title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Recordings in Country Music | date=January 22, 1997 | publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation }}</ref> It has been recorded over 22 times since with Keith Whitley's version standing out as one of the best versions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://secondhandsongs.com/work/95740/versions | title=Cover versions of I Never Go Around Mirrors written by Whitey Shafer, Lefty Frizzell &#124; SecondHandSongs | website=SecondHandSongs }}</ref>

== Personal troubles, later years, and death ==

Frizzell began a downward spiral after developing a debilitating alcohol problem. Despite his history of infidelity, arrests for sex with underage fans, contractual legal troubles, and automobile accidents, Alice Harper remained his wife, and their marriage produced three children.<ref name="Lefty Frizzell"/>

During the late 1960s, he recorded many songs, but Columbia released very few.<ref name="Larkin"/> Because of his declining record sales, he began to perform less. In 1968, he recorded with June Stearns as Agnes and Orville.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In early 1972, Frizzell left Columbia Records and signed with [[ABC Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> That same year, he was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and his song "If You've Got the Money (I've Got the Time)" earned him the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]].

By this time, drinking was taking a toll on him. He had developed [[chronic hypertension]], his appearance had changed drastically, and his voice had deteriorated. On July 19, 1975, at age 47, Frizzell died of a massive stroke,<ref name="Larkin"/> and was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens]] in [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee]]. Frizzell was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in October 1982.

== Guitar ==
[[File:Lefty2928 insert 003.jpg|thumb|Frizzell's custom guitar]]
Frizzell's signature guitar was a 1949 [[Gibson J-200]] (Model SJ-200). Originally built by the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]], it was retrofitted in early 1951 with a custom neck and pickguard by guitar maker and innovator [[Paul Bigsby]]. In a 2003 interview [[Merle Haggard]] recalled, "When I was a teenager, Lefty got me onstage [at the Rainbow Garden in [[Bakersfield, California]]] and handed me that guitar. That is the first guitar I played on a professional stage." For many years, the guitar had been on loan to and displayed at the Country Music Hall of Fame in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In January 2005, it was returned to the Frizzell family and was later sold via auction by Retrofret,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrofret.com/products.asp?ProductID=2928|title=RetroFret Vintage Guitars|website=Retrofret.com}}</ref> with an asking price of  $350,000; Haggard purchased the guitar and it remains a part of his estate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/value-in-old-guitars-1407782516|title=Value in Old Guitars|website=Barrons.com|accessdate=November 19, 2022}}</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Lefty Frizzell Columbia publicity 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Frizzell circa 1955]]
Frizzell's style of singing influenced a great many singers, particularly [[Merle Haggard]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[George Jones]], [[Keith Whitley]], and [[Roy Orbison]]. In addition, he was widely recognized for his songwriting talents. In the foreword to a biography of Frizzell by his younger brother [[David Frizzell]], Merle Haggard said, "The impact Lefty had on country music is not even measurable. ... No one could handle a song like Lefty. He would hold on to each word until he finally decided to drop it and pick up the next one. Most of us learned to sing listening to him."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1665021/nashville-skyline-honky-tonk-legend-lefty-frizzell-gets-a-new-biography.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910045128/http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1665021/nashville-skyline-honky-tonk-legend-lefty-frizzell-gets-a-new-biography.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 10, 2011|title=CMT : News : NASHVILLE SKYLINE: Honky-Tonk Legend Lefty Frizzell Gets a New Biography|work=CMT: Country Music Television}}</ref>

[[George Strait]] recorded a [[Sanger D. Shafer]] song called "Lefty's Gone" on the album ''[[Something Special (George Strait album)|Something Special]]''. In addition, Willie Nelson's 1977 album, ''[[To Lefty From Willie]]'' was a tribute to Frizzell and consisted entirely of cover versions of Frizzell songs. Frizzell was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1982 and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He is also in the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] along with his son Crockett Frizzell. Frizzell ranked number 31 on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s 2003 ''40 Greatest Men of Country Music''.

Fellow Texan Roy Orbison was a devout fan of Frizzell's sound, and in 1988, as a part of the [[Traveling Wilburys]], he chose the name "Lefty Wilbury" to honor his musical hero.

Maine singer-songwriter David Mallett included Frizzell's "Saginaw, Michigan" on his 2014 album ''The Horse I Rode in On''.

His younger brother, [[David Frizzell]], is also a country singer. His biggest hits were 1982's "[[I'm Gonna Hire a Wino (To Decorate Our Home)]]" and "[[You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma]]", a 1981 duet with [[Shelly West]]. The youngest brother, Allen Frizzell followed in his older brothers' footsteps in the country field. He was an opening performer for [[Dottie West]]. He was also married to Shelly West, daughter of Dottie West.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/west_shelly/bio.jhtml |title=CMT : Shelly West : Biography |access-date=April 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021192257/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/west_shelly/bio.jhtml |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Allen also played with Keith Whitley. He now plays country gospel music.

In 2006, J.D. Crowe and The New South released the album ''Lefty's Old Guitar''. The song "Lefty's Old Guitar" was written about his custom Gibson J-200.

[[Daryle Singletary]] referenced Frizzell in his song "Ain't It The Truth" on an album by the same name, released by [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1998.

In 2019, Frizzell's single "Long Black Veil" was selected by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Travis M. |date=March 20, 2019 |title=Jay-Z, a speech by Sen.

'''Lester William Polsfuss''' (June 9, 1915 – August 12, 2009), known as '''Les Paul''', was an American [[jazz guitarist|jazz]], [[country guitarist|country]], and [[blues]] guitarist, songwriter, [[luthier]], and inventor. He was one of the pioneers of the [[solid body|solid-body]] electric guitar, and his prototype, called the Log, served as inspiration for the [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smithsonianassociates.org/programs/paul/paul.asp |title=Voices from the Smithsonian Associates.

At the age of eight, Paul began playing the harmonica. After learning the piano, he switched to the banjo and guitar.  During this time, Paul invented a neck-worn harmonica holder, which allowed him to play both sides of the harmonica, hands-free, while performing on the banjo and guitar.  Les Paul's hands-free design is still widely manufactured today.<ref>(August 14, 2009).

==Career==

===Early career===
Paul and Wolverton moved to Chicago in 1934, where they continued to perform country music on radio station [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] and at the 1934 Chicago World's Fair. While in Chicago, Paul learned jazz from the great performers on Chicago's Southside. During the day, he played country music as Rhubarb Red on the radio. At night, he was Les Paul, playing jazz. He met pianist [[Art Tatum]], whose playing influenced him to continue with the guitar rather than play jazz on the piano.<ref name="Les Paul: The Living Legend of the Electric Guitar">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicjazzguitar.com/articles/article.jsp?article=25 |title=ClassicJazzGuitar.com |publisher=ClassicJazzGuitar.com |access-date=2012-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313012503/http://classicjazzguitar.com/articles/article.jsp?article=25 |archive-date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref> His first two records were released in 1936, credited to "Rhubarb Red", Paul's hillbilly alter ego. He also served as an accompanist for other bands signed to [[Decca Records|Decca]]. During this time, he began adding different sounds and adopted his stage name of Les Paul.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gil |last=Kaufman |publisher=MTV News |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618673/20090813/paul_les.jhtml |title=Paul Les |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816191607/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618673/20090813/paul_les.jhtml |archive-date=August 16, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Paul's guitar style was strongly influenced by the music of [[Django Reinhardt]], whom he greatly admired.<ref>Cook, Kenneth. "Book Review: "The Music of Django Reinhardt," by Benjamin Givan." ''ARSC Journal'' 42.1 (2011): 86–87.</ref> Following [[World War II]], Paul sought out and made friends with Reinhardt.

While jamming in his apartment basement in 1941,<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> Paul nearly succumbed to electrocution. During two years of recuperation, he moved to Chicago where he was the music director for radio stations WJJD and WIND. In 1943, he moved to Hollywood where he performed on radio and formed a new trio.

He was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1943,<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> where he served in the [[Armed Forces Radio Network]], backing such artists as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[the Andrews Sisters]], and performing in his own right.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tianen |first=Dave |title=The Wizard of Waukesha |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=August 26, 2009 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/les-paul/chasing-sound/100/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225154555/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/les-paul/chasing-sound/100/ |archive-date=February 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

As a last-minute replacement for [[Oscar Moore]], Paul played with [[Nat King Cole]] and other artists in the inaugural [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] concert in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], on July 2, 1944. His solo on "[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]" is a demonstration of his admiration for and emulation of Django Reinhardt, as well as his development of original lines.

Also that year, Paul's trio appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show. Crosby sponsored Paul's recordings. They recorded together several times, including "[[It's Been a Long, Long Time]]", which was a No. 1 hit<ref name="SoundOnSound"/> in 1945. Paul recorded several albums for [[Decca Records|Decca]] in the 1940s. [[The Andrews Sisters]] hired his trio to open for them during a tour in 1946. Their manager, Lou Levy, said watching Paul's fingers while he played guitar was like watching a train go by.<ref name="autogenerated2000">Sforza, John: "Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages.</ref> Their conductor, [[Vic Schoen]], said his playing was always original.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/>  Maxine Andrews said, "He'd tune into the passages we were singing and lightly play the melody, sometimes in harmony. We'd sing these fancy licks and he'd keep up with us note for note in exactly the same rhythm... almost contributing a fourth voice. But he never once took the attention away from what we were doing. He did everything he could to make us sound better."<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> In the 1950s, when he recorded Mary Ford's vocals on multiple tracks, he created music that sounded like [[the Andrews Sisters]].<ref name="autogenerated2000"/>

In January 1948, Paul shattered his right arm and elbow among multiple injuries in a near-fatal automobile accident on an icy [[Route 66]] west of [[Davenport, Oklahoma|Davenport]], [[Oklahoma]]. Mary Ford was driving the [[Buick]] convertible, which plunged off the side of a railroad overpass and dropped twenty feet into a ravine. They were returning from Wisconsin to Los Angeles after visiting family.<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> Doctors at Oklahoma City's Wesley Hospital told Paul that they could not rebuild his elbow. Their other option was [[amputation]]. Paul was flown to Los Angeles, where his arm was set at an angle—just over 90 degrees—that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar. It took him nearly a year and a half to recover.<ref name=freshair>{{cite web |author=Fresh Air from WHYY |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111888401 |title=Guitar Hero: Les Paul, 1915–2009 |website = NPR.org|access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628211807/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111888401 |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Guitar builder===
[[File:Daves58historic.jpg|thumb|Gibson '58 Reissue Les Paul guitar (2005)]]

{{anchor|The Log}}
In 1940, Les Paul revisited his experiments with the train rail. This time he created a similar prototype instrument, a one-off solid-body electric guitar known as "The Log", which was manufactured utilizing a common construction material often referred as a “4×4 stud post”, which provided a unique neck-thru design.  The “stud post” (a 4″ × 4″ section of [[Douglas fir]]) was then equipped with a crude bridge and an electromagnetic [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], neck and strings.  The Log was constructed by Paul after-hours in the New York City [[Epiphone]] guitar factory, and is one of the first solid-body electric guitars.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dkimages.com/discover/Home/Performing-Arts/Music/Instruments/String/Guitars/Electric-Guitar/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-01.html |title= The Log |publisher= DK Images |access-date= March 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110710140434/http://www.dkimages.com/discover/Home/Performing-Arts/Music/Instruments/String/Guitars/Electric-Guitar/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-01.html |archive-date= July 10, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Epiphone: A History|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx|publisher=Epiphone.com|access-date=February 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104095251/http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx|archive-date=November 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  For the sake of appearance, he attached the body of an [[Epiphone]] hollow-body guitar sawn lengthwise with The Log in the middle. This solved his two main problems: [[Audio feedback|feedback]], as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound, and sustain, as the energy of the strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the guitar body. These instruments were constantly being improved and modified over the years, and Paul continued to use them in his recordings even after the development of his eponymous Gibson model.

Paul approached the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] with his idea of a solid-body electric guitar in 1941,<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> 
but Gibson showed no interest until Fender began marketing its [[Fender Esquire|Esquire]] and [[Telecaster|Broadcaster]] guitars in 1950 (the Broadcaster was renamed the Telecaster in 1952).

Gibson's [[Ted McCarty]] was the chief designer of the guitar, which was based on Paul's drawings and later dubbed the [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Gibson entered into a promotional and financial arrangement with Les Paul, paying him a royalty on sales.<ref name=Lawrence2008>{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Robb|title=The Early Years of the Les Paul Legacy: 1915–1963|year=2008|publisher=Hal Leonard Corp|isbn=978-0634048616|page=304}}</ref> The guitar went on sale in 1952. Paul continued to  make design suggestions.

In 1960, sales of the original Les Paul model had dropped, so a more modernistic model was introduced (today called the SG), but then still bearing the Les Paul name. Not liking the new look and  severe problems with the strength of the body and neck, made Paul dissatisfied with this new Gibson guitar. This, and a pending divorce from [[Mary Ford]], led to Paul ending his endorsement and use of his name on Gibson guitars from 1964 until 1966, by which time his divorce was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jinxmagazine.com/les_paul.html |title= Interview &#124; July 19, 1999, at the Iridium jazz club, New York City |publisher= Jinx Magazine |date= July 19, 1999 |access-date= March 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713110152/http://www.jinxmagazine.com/les_paul.html |archive-date= July 13, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref>

{{anchor|Headless guitar}}
Paul continued to suggest technical improvements, although they were not always successful commercially. In 1962, Paul was issued {{US Patent|3,018,680}}, for a pickup in which the coil was integrated into the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3018680 |title= Patents | access-date = March 27, 2011}}</ref> In the mid-1940s, he introduced an aluminum guitar with the tuning mechanisms below the bridge. As it had no headstock, and the string attachments were at the nut, it was the first "headless" guitar. Unfortunately, Paul's guitar was so sensitive to the heat from stage lights that it would not keep tune. However, he used it for several of his hit recordings. This style was further developed by others, most successfully Ned [[Steinberger]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lespaulfoundation.org/sevenpages/page1.htm |title=Les Paul Guitar Innovations |access-date=2014-03-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140311025027/http://lespaulfoundation.org/sevenpages/page1.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

A less-expensive version of the Les Paul guitar is manufactured for Gibson's [[Epiphone]] brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epiphone Les Paul Standard|url=http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-Standard.aspx|publisher=Epiphone.com|access-date=February 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218185620/http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-Standard.aspx|archive-date=February 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Multitrack recording===
Paul first experimented with sound on sound while in elementary school when he punched holes in the [[piano roll]] for his mother's [[player piano]]. In 1946,  his mother complimented him on a song she had heard on the radio, when in fact she had heard George Barnes, not Paul.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kane|first1=Brian|title=Acousmatic Fabrications: Les Paul and the 'Les Paulverizer' |journal=Journal of Visual Culture|date=August 2011|volume=10|issue=2|page=216|doi=10.1177/1470412911402892|s2cid=193109700}}</ref> This motivated Paul to spend two years in his Hollywood garage recording studio, creating his unique sound, his New Sound. Paul stunned the music industry with his New Sound in 1948.

Paul recorded several songs with Bing Crosby, most notably "[[It's Been a Long, Long Time]]," which was a number-one single in 1945.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waksman|first1=Steve|title=Les Paul: In Memoriam|journal=Popular Music & Society|date=May 2010|volume=33|issue=2|page=271|doi=10.1080/03007761003707944|s2cid=191470269}}</ref><ref name="SoundOnSound"/>

After a recording session, Bing Crosby suggested that Paul build a recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted. Paul started his studio in the garage of his home on North Curson Street in Hollywood. The studio drew many vocalists and musicians who wanted the benefit of his expertise. His experiments included microphone placement, track speed, and recording overdubs. These methods resulted in a clarity previously unheard in this type of multitrack recording. People began to consider his recording techniques as instruments—as important to production as a guitar, bass, or drums.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waksman|first1=Steve|title=Les Paul: In Memoriam|journal=Popular Music & Society|date=May 2010|volume=33|issue=2|page=3|doi=10.1080/03007761003707944|s2cid=191470269}}</ref>

Capitol Records released "[[Lover (When You're Near Me)]]", on which Paul played eight different parts on electric guitar,<ref name="SoundOnSound"/> some recorded at half-speed, hence "double-fast" when played back at normal speed for the [[master recording|master]]. This was the first time he used multitracking in a recording. His early multitrack recordings, including "Lover" and "Brazil", were made with [[acetate disc]]s. He recorded a track onto a disk, then recorded himself playing another part with the first. He built the multitrack recording with overlaid tracks rather than parallel ones as he did later. By the time he had a result that satisfied him, he had discarded some five hundred recording disks.

As a teen he had built a disc-cutter assembly using the flywheel from a [[Cadillac]], a dental belt and other parts from his father's car repair shop. Years later in his Hollywood garage, he used the acetate disc setup to record parts at different speeds and with delay, resulting in his signature sound with echoes and birdsong-like guitar riffs.

In 1949, Crosby gave Paul one of the first [[Ampex]] Model 200A [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel to reel tape recorders]].<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> Paul invented sound on sound recording using this machine by placing an additional playback head, located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads. This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track, both of which were mixed together onto a new track. The Ampex was a monophonic tape recorder with only one track across the entire width of quarter-inch tape, and therefore, the recording was "destructive" in the sense that the original recording was permanently replaced with the new, mixed recording. He eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track. This preserved the original recording.<ref name="aes.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/sel-sync/snyder_sel-sync.pdf |title=Sel-sync and the "Octopus": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs |work=ARSC Journal |access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519105331/http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/sel-sync/snyder_sel-sync.pdf |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1952, Paul invented the [[flanging|flange effect]], where a sound phases in and out in harmonic tone. The first example of this can be heard on his song "Mammy's Boogie".<ref name="Bode">{{cite journal |last1=Bode |first1=Harald |title=History of Electronic Sound Modification |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |date=October 1984 |volume=32 |issue=10 |page=730}}</ref><ref name="Thompson">{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Art |title=Stompbox: A History of Guitar, Fuzzes, Flangers, Phasers, Echoes & Wahs |date=1997 |publisher=Miller Freeman |location=San Francisco, Calif. |isbn=0-87930-479-0 |page=24}}</ref>

Observing film recordings inspired Paul to design the stacking of eight tape recorders. He worked with [[Ross S.

===Les Paul and Mary Ford===
{{main|Les Paul and Mary Ford}}
[[File:Les Paul and Mary Ford 1954.jpg|thumb|Paul and Mary Ford in 1954]]
In the summer of 1945, Paul met country-western singer Iris Colleen Summers. They began working together on Paul's radio show, as Rhubarb Red and The Ozark Apple Knockers with Mary Lou. Later Paul suggested the stage name [[Mary Ford]]. They married in Milwaukee in 1949.

Their hits included "[[How High the Moon]]", "[[Bye Bye Blues (song)|Bye Bye Blues]]", "Song in Blue", "Don'cha Hear Them Bells", "[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]", and "[[Vaya con Dios (song)|Vaya con Dios]]". The songs were recorded with multiple tracks where Ford harmonized with herself and Paul played multiple layers of guitars.

They used the recording technique known as [[close miking]]<ref name=Garage/> where the microphone is less than {{convert|6|in|cm|0}} from the singer's mouth. This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when a singer is {{convert|1|ft|cm|-1}} or more from the microphone. When using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice due to the microphone's [[Proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]] and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard. The result is a singing style which diverged from the unamplified theater style of the musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.

They also performed music-hall style semi-comic routines with Mary mimicking whatever line Les decided to improvise.<ref>{{Citation|title=Les Paul & Mary Ford Absolutely Live|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awjTKeS9Wvo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/awjTKeS9Wvo| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|date=June 27, 2014|language=en|access-date=2021-08-11}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Radio and television programs===
Paul hosted a 15-minute radio program, ''The Les Paul Show'', on [[NBC Radio]] in 1950, featuring his trio (himself, Ford and rhythm player Eddie Stapleton) and his electronics. The program was recorded from their home and with gentle humor between Paul and Ford bridging musical selections, some of which had already been successful on records, some of which anticipated the couple's recordings, and many of which presented re-interpretations of such jazz and pop selections as "[[In the Mood]]", "Little Rock Getaway", "Brazil", and "[[Tiger Rag]]". Many of these shows survive and are available from various sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/TheLesPaulShow |title=The Les Paul Show |access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629051309/http://www.archive.org/details/TheLesPaulShow |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

When Paul used magnetic tape, he could take his recording equipment on tour, making episodes for his fifteen-minute radio show in a hotel room.

The show appeared on television a few years later with the same format, but excluding the trio and retitled ''Les Paul & Mary Ford at Home'' with "Vaya Con Dios" as the [[Theme music|theme song]]. Sponsored by [[Warner–Lambert]]'s [[Listerine]] [[mouthwash]], it was aired on [[NBC television]] during 1954–1955, and then was [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] until 1960. The five-minute show, consisting of the performance of only one or two songs, aired five times a day, five days a week, and therefore was used as a brief interlude or fill-in for programming schedules.

During his radio shows, Paul introduced the fictional "{{visible anchor|Les Paulverizer}}" device, which multiplies anything fed into it, such as a guitar sound or a voice. It was Paul's way of explaining how his single guitar could be multiplied to become a group of guitars. The device even became the subject of comedy, with Ford multiplying herself and her [[vacuum cleaner]] with it so she could finish the housework faster. Later, Paul created a real Les Paulverizer that he attached to his guitar. The invention allowed Paul to access pre-recorded layers of songs during live performances so he could replicate his recorded sound on stage.<ref name="Les Paul Foundation5">{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Sue|title=Les Paul Inventor and performer|url=http://www.lespaulfoundation.org/blog/les-paul-inventor-and-performer/#more-2087|publisher=Les Paul Foundation|access-date=February 4, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140204014322/http://www.lespaulfoundation.org/blog/les-paul-inventor-and-performer/#more-2087|archive-date=February 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Later career===
[[File:Les Paul.jpg|thumb|left|Paul in May 2004|201x201px]]
In 1965, Paul went into semi-retirement, although he did return to his studio occasionally. He and Ford had divorced at the end of 1964 after she became tired of touring.<ref name="nytdiv">"[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/18/les-paul-obtains-divorce.html Les Paul Obtains Divorce] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310074024/https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/18/les-paul-obtains-divorce.html |date=March 10, 2018 }}", ''The New York Times'', December 18, 1964.</ref> One of Paul's most recognizable recordings from then through the mid-1970s was an album for [[London Records]]/[[Phase 4 Stereo]], ''Les Paul Now'' (1968), on which he updated some of his earlier hits. Paul played the initial guitar track, and [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]] laid down the additional tracks while Paul engineered in his home studio. He also recorded two albums, ''[[Chester and Lester]]'' (1976) and ''[[Guitar Monsters]]'' (1978), for [[RCA Victor]], comprising a meld of jazz and country improvisation with guitar virtuoso [[Chet Atkins]], backed by some of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s celebrated studio musicians.

In 1969 Paul produced the album ''Poe Through the Glass Prism'' for RCA. The album featured songs based on Edgar Allan Poe's writing by the northeastern Pennsylvania band the Glass Prism. The album produced a single titled "The Raven" that appeared on Billboard's Hot 100.

As years progressed Paul played at slower tempos with a large pick that was easier to hold in his arthritic hand. In 2006, at the age of  90, he won two Grammy Awards at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]] for his album ''Les Paul & Friends: American Made World Played''. He also performed every Monday night at Manhattan's [[Iridium Jazz Club]] with guitarist Lou Pallo, bassist Paul Nowinski (and later, [[Nicki Parrott]]), and guitarist [[Frank Vignola]] and for a few years, pianist [[John Colianni]]. Paul, Pallo and Nowinski also performed at [[Scheffel Hall|Fat Tuesdays]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iridiumjazzclub.com/|title=Iridium Jazz Club|publisher=Iridium Jazz Club|access-date=March 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305204105/http://iridiumjazzclub.com/|archive-date=March 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Milicia">{{cite web |last1=Milicia |first1=Joe |title=Guitar hero Les Paul ready for Rock Hall tribute |url=https://tucson.com/news/guitar-hero-les-paul-ready-for-rock-hall-tribute/article_c6063d6c-83c7-5add-bff2-e7b10ab8bacb.html |website=Arizona Daily Star |access-date=28 July 2018 |date=7 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221408/https://tucson.com/news/guitar-hero-les-paul-ready-for-rock-hall-tribute/article_c6063d6c-83c7-5add-bff2-e7b10ab8bacb.html |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Foster, D.R.

In June 2017, Parham was featured on a various artists' tribute to Mark Heard, ''Treasure of the Broken Land: The Songs of Mark Heard'', which showcased Heard's songwriting performed by [[Buddy Miller]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[North Mississippi Allstars]], [[Over the Rhine (band)|Over the Rhine]], [[The Voice (U.S. season 8)|Sara Potenza]], and more.  While working on this project, Parham befriended [[Amy Helm]] and the two sang a duo together.

'''Lisa Stewart''' (born August 6, 1968) is an American [[country music]] and jazz artist, actress, and  television host. In 1991, she signed to [[BNA Records]] (then known as BNA Entertainment), releasing her self-titled debut album that year. This album produced two singles for her on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Stewart is a BMI Award winning songwriter and has  appeared in films alongside Oscar winners Gwynneth Paltrow and Melissa Leo. She currently tours with her jazz combo.

==Life and career==
Stewart was born August 6, 1968, in [[Louisville, Mississippi]].<ref name="miss">{{cite web |url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/lisa-stewart.html |title=Lisa Stewart, Mississippi country singer |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |last=Glass |first=Paul |work=Mississippi Writers and Musicians}}</ref> She first sang in public at age six in her church. Five years later, she attended a Tent Show at the Nashville Fan Fair, where she gave her first country performance. By 1987, Stewart had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she won the Roy Acuff scholarship at Belmont University and found work as a studio singer.

While performing at a wedding reception in 1991, Stewart was noticed by Mark Thompson, [[Wynonna Judd]]'s bandleader, who asked Stewart to sing demos for him. After recording the demos, Stewart signed to a recording contract with BNA Entertainment (now known as [[BNA Records]]), releasing her debut single "Somebody's in Love" in late 1992. This song was the first of three singles from her self-titled debut album — which was released in January 1993 — followed by "Under the Light of the Texaco" and "Drive Time". Also included on the album was a cover of [[Jeannie Seely]]'s 1966 single "Don't Touch Me".

In addition to promoting her album on radio tours, Stewart hosted the nationally syndicated entertainment news show ''#1 Country''. She also made appearances on [[The Nashville Network]], hosting their programs ''Yesteryear'' and ''This Week in Country Music'' and was a featured performer on "Music City Tonight". 

In 1994, she recorded her second album for BNA. Produced by [[Barry Beckett]], the album was entitled <i>Solitary Heart</i>, and the first single was set to be "[[Let's Go to Vegas]]" (later a Top 5 hit for [[Faith Hill]]), but after a shakeup at the label, Stewart was dropped and the album was shelved. 

From 1997-1999, she co-hosted <i>This Week in Country Music</i> with Steve Phillips on TNN. She also continued to tour throughout the late 1990s.

Stewart began acting in the 21st century under her married name of Lisa Stewart Seals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/lisa-stewart-seals-movie/ |title=Lisa Stewart Seals Scores Role in Tim McGraw Movie |website=Theboot.com |date= 8 February 2010|accessdate=2020-04-04}}</ref> but is currently known as Lisa Stewart.

She is now making a mark in the jazz world and performs with her combo, often featuring Chester Thompson on drums (Genesis, Weather Report, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention).

'''Lonnie McIntosh''' (July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016), known as '''Lonnie Mack''', was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. He was influential in the development of [[blues rock]] music and [[rock music|rock]] [[guitar solo]]ing.

Mack emerged in 1963 with his breakthrough LP, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. It earned him lasting renown as both a [[blue-eyed soul]] singer<ref name="Davidson">{{Cite web |last=Davidson |first=Merric |date=2016-05-18 |title=Lonnie Mack |url=https://www.toppermost.co.uk/lonnie-mack/ |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Toppermost |language=en-US}}</ref> and a [[lead guitar]] innovator. The album's instrumental tracks included two hit singles, "Memphis" and "Wham". In them, Mack, using "top-quality technique" and "pristine" phrasing,<ref>{{Citation |title=British guitarist analyses Lonnie Mack and Stevie Ray Vaughan live in 1986! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaE2tN8dUx0 |access-date=2023-12-13 |language=en}}</ref> added "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" melodies and runs to the predominant chords-and-riffs pattern of early rock guitar.<ref name="auto">Hagood, "[https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ Lonnie Mack: Remembering His Trailblazing Blues-Rock Guitar Virtuosity]", Website:"Keeping the Blues Alive", April 29, 2016. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826121524/https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ |date=August 26, 2018 }}</ref> These tracks raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency,<ref>Interviewed for [[Duane Allman]]'s 2006 biography, guitarist Mike Johnstone recalled sixteen-year-old Allman's fascination with ''Memphis'', saying: "Now, at that time, there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.'"

Music historian [[Dick Shurman]], as quoted McCardle, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74]", Washington Post, April 25, 2016. Mack was a strong influence on several founders of Southern rock: (1) [[Allman Brothers]] lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]]: "People like Dickey Betts would tell you that without Lonnie they wouldn't be who they were. That goes for all of us." April 23, 2016, posting on Official Warren Haynes website, preserved at http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack; (2) Before finding fame as lead guitarist of the Allman Brothers, seventeen-year-old [[Duane Allman]] honed his soloing skills by playing ''Memphis'' along with Mack's record, repeatedly stopping and starting the record with his foot, until he had mastered Mack's technique. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, p. 10 ''et seq''.). (3) Remembering the unchallenging simplicity of early rock guitar, Allman Brothers co-lead guitarist, Dickey Betts, observed: "I was really gettin' tired of all the beach songs, and "Louie, Louie". Those are great songs, but I'm talkin' about ''guitar-playing''. And then, here come Lonnie Mack, right down the middle of it all. God, what a breath of fresh air that was for me." Betts video commentary at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij-LTAFB9o8; (4) Mack was a significant influence on two founders of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Steve Gaines]] and [[Ed King]]. Odom, ''Lynyrd Skynyrd: Remembering The Free Birds Of Southern Rock'', Broadway Books 2002, at p. 142. Before Gaines' rise to Skynyrd fame, he practiced "playing (''Memphis'') by ear until he could imitate" Mack, who was one of Gaines' "favorite artists". ''Id.'' Gaines can be heard singing and playing Mack's "Why" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAXU_-q3srs.</ref> that soon followed.

Shortly after the album's release, however, the [[British Invasion]] hit American shores, and Mack's recording career "withered on the vine".<ref>Puterbaugh, "[https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-british-invasion-from-the-beatles-to-the-stones-the-sixties-belonged-to-britain-244870/ The British Invasion: From the Beatles to the Stones, The Sixties Belonged to Britain]", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', July 14, 1988.

He was soon performing in major venues, but his multi-genre Elektra albums downplayed his lead guitar and blues rock appeal and record sales were modest. During this period, he became increasingly unhappy with the music business. He left Elektra in 1971, and for the next fourteen years he functioned as a low-profile multi-genre recording artist, roadhouse performer, sideman, and music-venue proprietor.

He continued to perform, mostly in small venues, until 2004.<ref name="auto1">See section below entitled "Career chronology".</ref>

== Early life and musical influences ==

Shortly before Mack's birth, his family moved from [[Appalachia]]n (eastern) [[Kentucky]] to [[Dearborn County]], [[Indiana]], on the banks of the Ohio River.<ref>During the migration of refugees from the coal mine closures in Southern Appalachia before World War II, most sought jobs in industrialized cities.  However, Mack's parents settled twenty miles downriver from Cincinnati, living and working on sharecropping farms.</ref> One of five children, he was born to parents Robert and Sarah Sizemore McIntosh on July 18, 1941, in [[West Harrison]], Indiana,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Mack, July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016|url=http://www.alligator.com/news/index.cfm/nid/689/t/Lonnie-Mack|website=Alligator.com}}</ref> near Cincinnati, Ohio. He was raised on a series of nearby [[sharecropping]] farms.

Using a floor-model radio powered by a truck battery, his family routinely listened to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' [[country music]] show. Continuing to listen after the rest of the family had retired for the night, Mack became a fan of [[rhythm and blues]] and [[traditional black gospel]] music.<ref>Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back of the Track", Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56.</ref>

He began playing guitar at the age of seven, after trading his bicycle for a [[Lone Ranger]] model acoustic guitar.<ref>(1) Forte, "Lonnie Mack: That Memphis Man is Back", 1978, p. 20; (2) Murrells, The Book of Golden Discs, Barrie & Jenkins, 1978, p.163</ref> His mother taught him basic chords,<ref name="Grimes" /> and he was soon playing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] guitar in the family band.<ref name="McArdle">{{Cite news |last=McArdle |first=Terence |date=2016-04-25 |title=Lonnie Mack, guitarist and singer who influenced blues and rock acts, dies at 74 |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html |access-date=2022-07-29 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Mack recalled that when he was "seven or eight years old" an uncle from Texas introduced him to [[blues]] guitar<ref name="merged1">{{cite AV media |date=March 13, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |title=Lonnie Mack Interview |publisher=John Broughton |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=October 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210105133502/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |archive-date=January 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> and that when he was about ten years of age, an "old black man" named Wayne Clark introduced him to "[[Robert Johnson]] style guitar".

His musical influences remained diverse as he refined his playing and singing styles.

== Career ==

Mack's career-long pattern of switching and mixing within the entire range of white and black Southern roots music genres<ref>His most popular albums, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963), ''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985), and ''Attack of the Killer V'' (1990) were blues-oriented with a rock instrumental bent and a [[traditional black gospel]] vocal bent. ''Dueling Banjos'' (1973) was an album of traditional bluegrass tunes. ''Glad I'm in the Band'' (1969) and ''Whatever's Right'' (1969) were ecletic with an emphasis on country and soul. ''The Hills of Indiana'' (1971) was almost entirely country, with a singer-songwriter emphasis. ''Coco's'' (1983) was a mix of traditional country, acoustic and electric blues, deep soul, blues-rock, and roots-rock. ''South'' (1978) was a mix of country-pop and bluegrass. ''Second Sight'' (1986) and ''Roadhouses and Dance Halls'' (1988) were eclectic mixes of rockabilly, roots-rock, and [[outlaw country]]. ''Home at Last'' (1977) was mostly country. ''Pismo'' (1978) was a mix of country, rockabilly and Southern rock.</ref> made him "as difficult to market as he was to describe."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dansby |first=Andrew |date=2016-12-27 |title=Music and death 2016: You want it darker? |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/columnists/dansby/article/Music-and-death-2016-You-want-it-darker-10820590.php |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Houston Chronicle |language=en-US}}</ref>  He enjoyed periods of significant commercial success as a rock artist in the 1960s and 1980s, but was mostly absent from the rock spotlight for two long stretches of his career (1971–1984 and 1991–2004),<ref>1971–1984 (became low-profile country artist) and 1991–2004 (ceased recording but sporadically appeared in small venues).</ref> during which he continued to perform, mostly in small venues, as a roots-rock "cult figure".<ref>(1) Grimes, "Lonnie Mack, Singer and Guitarist Who Pioneered Blues-Rock, Dies at 74", New York Times, April 22, 2016. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/arts/music/lonnie-mack-singer-and-guitarist-who-pioneered-blues-rockdies-at-https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/arts/music/lonnie-mack-singer-and-guitarist-who-pioneered-blues-rockdies-at-74.html?_r=0; (2) In the 1980s, Mack was "elevated to cult status as a blues-rock guitar hero".

In 1954, at age 13, Mack dropped out of school after a fight with a teacher. Large and mature-looking for his age, he obtained a counterfeit ID and began performing professionally in bars around [[Cincinnati]] with a band led by drummer Hoot Smith.<ref>Larry Nager, "Guitar Greatness", Cincinnati Enquirer (Cincinnati.com), March 13, 1998, as preserved at http://www2.cincinnati.com/freetime/weekend/031398_weekend.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729013715/http://www2.cincinnati.com/freetime/weekend/031398_weekend.html |date=July 29, 2017 }}.

"Hey Baby" (Sage, 1959), a bluegrass/rockabilly tune headlined by two of his older cousins, Aubrey Holt and Harley Gabbard, was reissued by Bear Family Records in 2010. It was included in the album "That'll Flat Git It! Vol. 27: Rockabilly & Rock 'n' Roll From The Vault Of Sage & Sand Records: Various Artists". {{ISBN|978-3-89916-577-7}}.

In the early 1960s he became a [[session musicians|session guitarist]] with [[Fraternity Records]], a small Cincinnati label. In 1963, he recorded two hit singles for Fraternity, the proto-blues-rock guitar instrumentals "Memphis" and "Wham!". He soon recorded additional tunes to flesh out his debut album, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. Mack made some notable recordings later, particularly in the 1980s,<ref>''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985) and ''Lonnie Mack Live: Attack of the Killer V'' (1990), were commercially successful and drew critical acclaim.</ref> but his debut album (released October 1963) is widely considered the centerpiece of his career. It became a perennial critics' favorite:

*1968: Guitar: "...in a class by himself."...Vocals: "...sincerity and intensity that's hard to find anywhere."<ref>Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man",''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968</ref> – Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'', calling for re-issuance of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album.
*1987: "With so many trying to copy this same style, this album sounds surprisingly modern. Not many have done it this well, though."<ref>Himes, "Lonnie Mack", ''The Washington Post'', February 20, 1987</ref> – Gregory Himes, ''The Washington Post''
*1992: "The first of the guitar-hero records is also one of the best, and for perhaps the last time, the singing on such a disc is worthy of the guitar histrionics."<ref name="Guterman 1992, p. 34">Guterman, "The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time", Citadel Publishing, 1992, p. 34 (ranking the album No. 16).</ref> – Jimmy Guterman, ranking the album No. 16 in ''The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time''
*2007: "...a spectacular feast of down-home blues, gospel, R&B, and country chicken-pickin'...a unique vision of American roots music [that was] five years ahead of the British blues-rockers."<ref>Rubin, "Inside the Blues, 1942–1982", Hal Leonard, 2007, at page 124.</ref> – Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues, 1942–1982''
*2016: "Of all the Mack material available this is the one [album] I'd regard as absolutely essential."<ref name="Davidson" /> – Dave Stephens, ''Toppermost''

He recorded many additional sides for Fraternity between 1963 and 1967, but few, if any, were broadly released or strongly promoted, and none charted.<ref>Apart from "Memphis" (Billboard #5) and Wham!" (Billboard #24), only two additional Mack Fraternity singles charted: "Honky-Tonk '65" (#78) and "Baby, What's Wrong?" (#93). See, Billboard's "Chart History" list for Mack at http://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719031335/https://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart |date=July 19, 2018 }}.</ref> Three decades later, [[Ace Records (UK)]] packaged the entirety of Mack's Fraternity output (previously released, unreleased, alternate takes, and demos) in a series of compilations.<ref>See, Ace's Lonnie Mack page and links at https://www.acerecords.co.uk/search?query=lonnie+mack.

"It looked like the guitar wizard was ready to bust out when the music world was turned on its ear. [In] February 1964, [[The Beatles]] appeared on the [[Ed Sullivan]] Show, and Mack's [recording] career withered on the vine."<ref>Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues: 1942–1982'', "Rockin' the Blues: Lonnie Mack & Michael Bloomfield", Hal Leonard (Updated Ed., 2007) at p. 124.</ref>

Although his recording career had stalled out, Mack stayed busy as a performer, criss-crossing the country with one-night stands. "The '60s, man, we was full of piss and vinegar, nothing bothered us. We had [[History and culture of substituted amphetamines#In music|bennies]], like the truckers had [and] we just stayed on the road all the time."<ref name="merged1" /> During that time, "[we] performed with just about everybody, [from] [[Jimi Hendrix]] [to] [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Dick and Dee Dee]]."<ref>McNutt, Guitar Towns, University of Indiana Press, 2002, at page 176.</ref> He also took on session work with [[James Brown]], [[Freddie King]], [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]], Albert Washington, and other R&B/soul artists.<ref>See, Mack discography at http://wdd.mbnet.fi/lonniemack.htm.

In 1968, at the height of the blues-rock era, [[Elektra Records]] bought out Mack's dormant Fraternity recording contract and moved him to Los Angeles to record three albums.<ref>Mack's three Elektra albums were ''[[Glad I'm in the Band]]'' (1969), ''[[Whatever's Right]]'' (1969), and ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'' (1971). These were eclectic collections of country and soul ballads, blues tunes, and updated versions of earlier recordings. Both 1969 albums emphasized Mack's vocals and de-emphasized his guitar work. They were modest commercial successes. Mack's final Elektra effort, ''The Hills of Indiana'', was a country album recorded in [[Nashville]] that attracted little attention.</ref> In November 1968, the newly founded ''Rolling Stone'' magazine published a rave review of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album, persuading Elektra to re-issue it.<ref>(a) Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968. (b) Elektra obliged, adding two bonus tracks from 1964 (''Farther On Down The Road'' and ''Chicken-Pickin''), under the title "For Collectors Only".</ref> He was soon performing in major rock venues, including the [[Fillmore East]], the [[Fillmore West]], and the [[Cow Palace]]. He opened for [[the Doors]]<ref>{{Citation |title=The Doors – Blues For Lonnie |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zpNnje-GRs |language=en |access-date=2022-07-29}}</ref> and [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] and shared the stage with [[Johnny Winter]], [[Elvin Bishop]] and other popular rock and blues artists of the time.<ref>(1) Deccio, "Lonnie Mack Dead", April 24, 2016, http://www.inquisitr.com/3029420/lonnie-mack-dead-guitarist-and-vocalist-who-pioneered-blues-rock-dies-at-74/; (2) Poster for Mack's six-day run at the Fillmore West in July 1969 at http://www.classicposters.com/Johnny_Winter/poster/Bill_Graham/180; (3) Poster of Mack's Cow Palace appearance with the Doors and Elvin Bishop at http://www.classicposters.com/Lonnie_Mack; (4) Mack's reference to appearing with C, S &N at the Fillmore East in his 1985 Carnegie Hall interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHAcMm8pxvo.</ref>

It was the [[hippie]] era, however, and Mack's rustic, blue-collar persona made for a rough fit with commercial rock's target demographic. John Morthland wrote: "[All] the superior chops in the world couldn't hide the fact that chubby, country Mack probably had more in common with Kentucky truck drivers than he did with the new rock audience."<ref>(1) Morthland, "Lonnie Mack", ''Output'', March 1984; (2) "Lonnie was a real country boy". Elektra producer Russ Miller, in Holzman, ''Follow the Music'', First Media, 1998, p. 367.</ref> In addition, after two multi-genre Elektra albums (both recorded in 1969) that downplayed his blues-rock strengths, including his guitar, Mack himself was dissatisfied: "My music wasn't working that good then. I ain’t really happy with a lot of the stuff I did there."<ref>Mack, as quoted in McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}.</ref>

At that point in his career, Mack took a break from performing and recording. According to [[Robbie Krieger]], lead guitarist of Elektra label-mate the Doors, Mack was seen during this period "selling Bibles out of the back of his car."<ref>Graff, Doors celebrate 50 years of "Morrison Hotel:" Q&A, The Oakland Press, Oct. 9, 2020, at https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/doors-celebrate-50-years-of-morrison-hotel-q-a/article_2a9bc814-0a4d-11eb-b11f-277180eb19ef.html</ref> He also worked for Elektra's A&R department, helping to recruit new talent.<ref>Upon completing his 1969 albums, Mack assumed a "[[Chet Atkins]]-[[Eric Clapton]] role at Elektra, doing studio dates, producing and A&R." (''Rolling Stone'', "Random Notes", February 7, 1970, p. 4,) In that role, he helped to recruit a number of country and blues artists from Nashville, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Elektra considered the launch of a specialty label to record them. (Holzman, ''Follow The Music'', First Media, 1998, pp. 366–67.) Mack was instrumental in signing [[Mickey Newbury]], but could not generate much interest in some other prospects, including [[Roberta Flack]]. (Houghton, ''Becoming Elektra'', 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246.) He then tried to sign [[Carole King]], but Elektra rejected her on the grounds that they already had [[Judy Collins]]. (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3.) Frustrated, he finally attempted to interest Elektra in gospel singer [[Dorothy Combs Morrison]], the former lead vocalist for the [[Edwin Hawkins Singers]] of "Oh Happy Day" fame. Mack had recorded Morrison singing a gospel-esque version of [[The Beatles]]' "Let It Be", and sought permission to release it; management's response was delayed, however, due to ongoing negotiations for the label's sale to Warner Brothers (Kot, Greg (December 13, 1989). "He Wrote The Book – tribunedigital-chicagotribune" (http://articles.chicagotribune.c{{dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} om/1989-12-13/features/8903170595_1_doors-morrison-hotel-memphis-man-lonnie-mack). Articles.chicagotribune.com. Retrieved August 18, 2015.), allowing a competing label to seize the initiative and release [[Aretha Franklin]]'s own gospel version first. "That bummed me out" (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3), Mack said. According to a close associate, Mack "had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business". (Hear, interview of Stuart Holman (Mack's bass-player in the early '70s), "Lonnie Mack Special", July 16, 2011, at
http://wvxu.org/post/lonnie-mack-special#stream/0.) Finally, Mack resigned from his A&R job. (Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back on the Track", ''Guitar World'', May 1984, pp. 59–60.)</ref> In 1971, with one album left to complete his contract with Elektra, Mack moved to [[Nashville]]. There, he recorded ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'', a multi-genre (but country-flavored) LP with a vocal emphasis.<ref name="Davidson" /> It included only one track showcasing his guitar virtuosity, "Asphalt Outlaw Hero". ''The Hills of Indiana'' attracted little attention.

Mack had begun missing the fun of small-town performance venues early in his time with Elektra<ref>Mary Campbell, "Blues Guitarist Mack Is Back", Terre Haute Tribune-Star, November 2, 1969, p. 66.</ref> and soon soured on the fantasy of rock celebrity status. "[It had] a lot to do with how much value you put on money as opposed to what makes you happy. I wasn't happy. So one of the best-feeling moments I ever had was when that L.A. sign was in my rear-view mirror and I was free again."<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train.&pg=PA73 Mack's departure from the LA rock scene apparently also involved a threatening premonition. Towards the end of Mack's time at Elektra, the label had put together a musical whistle-stop touring group, including Mack, Don Nix, and others, billed as "The Alabama State Troupers and Mount Zion Choir". (Holzman, Follow The Music, First Media, 2000, p. 36.) According to Elektra producer Russ Miller, Mack disappeared six days before the tour was to begin. Miller found him hiding out on his rustic Kentucky farm. Mack refused to join the tour, citing a nightmare during his last night in Los Angeles, in which he and his family had been pursued by Satan. He had awakened in a sweat, finding his Bible opened to a passage warning him to "flee from Mount Zion". Miller, a former evangelist preacher (Houghton, Becoming Elektra, 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246), knew Mack's mind. Returning to California alone, Miller explained: "[Lonnie's] a real country boy. [T]hat was it for Lonnie". (Holzman, ''supra''). Mack wrote a tune relating to this experience. In "A Song I Haven't Sung" (1986), he equated the pursuit of "fortune and fame" with selling one's soul to Satan, allowing the "body to live while your soul is left to rot". The tune appears on Mack's 1986 Alligator album, "Second Sight".</ref> On another occasion, Mack said: "Seems like every time I get close to really making it, to climbing to the top of the mountain, that's when I pull out. I just pull up and run."<ref>Mack, as quoted in Guralnick, Pickers, "Lonnie Mack: Fiery Picker Goes Country", 1977, pp. 16–18.</ref> Upon Mack's death in 2016, music historian [[Dick Shurman]] observed that Mack's temperament "wasn't suited to stardom. I think he'd rather have been hunting and fishing. He didn't like cities or the (music) business."<ref>(1) Dick Shurman, as quoted in McArdle, "Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74", [[Washington Post]] April 25, 2016, at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html.1]{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}). (2) Shurman's observation about Mack's dislike of cities finds support in the lyrics of two Mack tunes: (a) "L.A. made me sick." (''A Long Way From Memphis'', 1985); (b) (''Country'', 1976). (3) Shurman's observation about Mack's dislike of the music business was echoed by Stuart Holman, Mack's bass guitarist in the early 1970s: "Lonnie had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business."

In 1977, Mack was shot during an altercation with an off-duty police officer. The experience inspired Mack's tune, "Cincinnati Jail", a rowdy, guitar-and-vocal rock number that he favored in live performances later in his career.

In 1983, Mack relocated to [[Austin, Texas]], for a collaboration with his blues-rock disciple, guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].<ref>(1) Mack, as quoted in Gettleman, "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack Is A Low-Key Yet Major Influence On Many Musicians", Orlando Sentinel, as reproduced in Desert News/The Salt Lake Tribune, Tues. PM/Wed. AM, August 3–4, 1993 at p.3. (2) Vaughan idolized Mack, calling him "the baddest guitar player I know" (Vaughan, as heard on DVD entitled "American Caravan: Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble", recorded in 1986
at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis. It can be seen and heard ''here'': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkBqTWBIkKw.) and credited much of his own guitar style to Mack. ("Lonnie invented a lot of this stuff." Newton, "My First Interview With Stevie Ray Vaughan", at https://earofnewt.com/2015/08/26/my-first-interview- with-stevie-ray-vaughan-when-he-sang-me-three-lines-of-an-earl-king-song/.) Vaughan also said, "I got a lot of the fast things I do from Lonnie" (Menn, Secrets From The Masters, Miller-Freeman, Inc, 1992, p. 278, {{ISBN|0-87930-260-7}}). Three years before his death, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. (Vaughan interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcrkPrxj698). As a teen-ager, Vaughan honed his guitar skills by playing along with ''Wham!'', starting and stopping the record-player repeatedly as he attempted to copy Mack's guitar. (Vaughan interview, https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=GImi3eGVbSI, at counter 17:36; Patoski, "SRV: Caught in the Crossfire", 1993, Backbeat: 15–16.) In his teens, [[Duane Allman]] did the same with ''Memphis''. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10 ''et seq''.) Vaughan went on to record ''Wham!'' several times, and called his own instrumental, ''Scuttle-Buttin'', "just another way of playin' [Mack's 1964 instrumental] ''Chicken-Pickin''." (Vaughan, as quoted in review of the album ''Couldn't Stand The Weather'' at http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/stevie-ray-vaughan-couldnt-stand-the-weather-legacy-edition-album-review-265255.

{{blockquote | [In ''Wham!'', Mack] can be heard using the chordal licks of early rock guitar greats, but he infuses his breaks with string bends, pentatonic runs, and mature blues chops, all of which eventually became trademarks of Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield and Stevie Ray Vaughan...A tight chordal riff laid over a fast boogie-woogie rhythm sets the tone for the cut, which contains guitar breaks, vibrato arm highlights, echoey single-note lines, and the repetitive string-pushing licks that eventually became so prevalent in Jeff Beck's guitar style. }}

Mack's early guitar recordings remain closely identified with the dawn of virtuoso blues-rock guitar.<ref name=talkinblues>See, e.g., (1) {{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/talkin-blues-lonnie-mack-and-birth-blues-rock |title=Talkin' Blues: Lonnie Mack and the Birth of Blues-Rock |magazine=[[Guitar World]]|access-date=May 18, 2014}}; (2) Guitar Player, "101 Forgotten Greats and Unsung Heroes", January 2, 2007, at https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/101-forgotten-greats-andamp-unsung-heroes; and (3) Brown & Newquist, ''Legends of Rock Guitar'', "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997 at p.25. (4) They were not his only early demonstrations of soloing skill, however. ''Suzie Q'' (1963) and ''Lonnie on the Move'' (1964) are often mentioned, but the former was not promoted as a single and the latter was lost in the tidal wave of the [[British Invasion]]. A third, ''Chicken-Pickin'' (1964), widely considered Mack's greatest early demonstration of fret-board speed, suffered a similar fate. More recently, Jeff Beck regularly performed ''Lonnie on the Move'' during his 2015 and 2016 tours.  It is a direct copy of Mack's own live, 1990 version. Beck probably first heard the tune when it was issued in Britain on the Stateside label in 1964.

While some of Mack's signature performance elements had appeared in early rock saxophone and keyboard solos, a seamless combination of all was essentially unheard in rock guitar before Mack.<ref>(1) "Before Lonnie, the horn guys did all the lead work. He made the guitar the pre-eminent lead instrument". Former Elektra executive James Webber, in Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train%3B&pg=PA73 See also, Sandmel, Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56. (2) Mack's lead guitar style did not go mainstream overnight. As late as November 1968, a ''Rolling Stone'' reviewer found his use of bluegrass-style runs in his solos "peculiar". Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man!", Rolling Stone, November 23, 1968.</ref> Rock historian Dave Stephens rates Mack's overall guitar sound "highly distinctive, dare I say, unique; in the early rock era only Link Wray and Duane Eddy could match him for instant recognition."<ref name="Davidson" />

== Mack's role in the evolution of rock lead guitar ==

Although notable commercial success was periodic and fleeting, Mack's early-1960s recordings became rock guitar trendsetters. They raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency, helped propel the electric guitar to the top of soloing instruments in rock, and served as prototypes for the genres of blues rock and Southern rock.

Interviewed for a biography of Southern Rock guitar legend [[Duane Allman]], guitarist and early Allman associate Mike Johnstone recalled the professional impact of Mack's rock guitar proficiency when he and Allman were starting out:<ref>Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10.</ref>

{{blockquote | Now, [in 1963], there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.' }}

Another player of that era observed: "Lonnie Mack made the other guitar-slingers of the day – [[Duane Eddy]], [[Dick Dale]], [[the Ventures]] – sound tame by comparison. Only [[Travis Wammack]] and [[Link Wray]] came close."<ref>Windham, "REVIEW: Lonnie Mack made other guitarists in his day sound tame by comparison", Tuscaloosa News, 11/13/2003, preserved on-line at https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/story/news/2003/11/14/review-lonnie-mack-made-other-guitarists-in-his-day-sound-tame-by-comparison/27851967007/</ref>

Mack's "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" blues guitar sound is also credited with a key role in the electric guitar's rise to the top of soloing instruments in rock. Blues critic Shawn Hagood wrote:<ref name="auto" />

{{blockquote | His playing was faster, louder, more aggressive than anything people were used to hearing. He essentially paved the way for the electric guitar to become a soloing instrument in rock music. A true blues-rock pioneer, the genre would not have been the same – indeed, much of rock music might not have been the same – without his innovative way of treating the electric guitar as a lead soloing instrument in rock – edgy, aggressive, loud and fast. }}

Former Elektra [[A&R]] executive James Webber agrees:<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&dq=schaber+mule+train&pg=PA73</ref>

{{blockquote | Lonnie took rock guitar playing to a whole different level. You had to really play now. [B]efore Lonnie, the sax guys did all of the lead work. He made the guitar the preeminent lead instrument. }}

Mack's early-1960s guitar tracks are said to have set the stage for blues-rock guitar and Southern rock guitar, styles that first enjoyed broad popularity a few years later. From ''Legends of Rock Guitar'' (1997):<ref>Brown & Newquist, Legends of Rock Guitar, "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997, p. 24.</ref>

{{blockquote | [Mack] is essentially the missing guitar link between the twangy, multi-string riffing of rockabilly and the bluesy, string-pushing players of the mid-sixties. He also made the crucial bridge between the black blues and white hillbilly music via his lead work...In all, it is not an exaggeration to say that Lonnie Mack was well ahead of his time in 1963. His bluesy solos predated the pioneering blues-rock guitar work of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and Mike Bloomfield by nearly two years. [Since] ''they'' are considered "before their time", the chronological significance of Lonnie Mack for the world of rock guitar is that much more remarkable. }}

Southern rock ([[Allman Brothers]]) lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] expressed a similar assessment:<ref name="Warren Haynes">{{cite web|url=http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack|title=Warren Haynes – news|website=Warrenhaynes.net|access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>

== Mack's 1958 Gibson Flying V Guitar, "Number 7" ==
Mack was closely identified with the distinctive-looking [[Gibson Flying V]] guitar that first appeared in 1958. When he was seventeen, he bought the seventh Flying V off the first-year production line, naming it "Number 7".
Mack was viscerally attracted to the arrow-like shape of the guitar.<ref name="gibson.com">McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}</ref> Mack played "Number 7" almost exclusively throughout his career.<ref>McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson online at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}, May 9, 2007.</ref> The title of Mack's final album, ''Attack of the Killer V'', was a reference to his guitar.

Early in his career, Mack added a Bigsby vibrato bar to the guitar. It required mounting a steel crossbeam approximately six inches below the apex of the "V", giving the guitar a unique appearance. Mack favored thick (heavy) strings, i.e., .010, .012, .018w, .028, .038, .052. He typically only bent the first (higher) two, and used a wound string only for the third. He said that the wound third string was important to his sound.<ref>Russ House, Reverb.com, "Celebrity Owned Gibson Flying V" (detailed specifications of No. 7 and its Mack-approved replicas), 2017 (no month or day shown), at https://reverb.com/item/15750071-celebrity-owned-gibson-flying-v-personal-run-for-lonnie-mack</ref>

== "Blue-eyed soul" vocals ==

Throughout his career, Mack's vocals blended white and black Southern roots influences. One commentator dubbed his singing style "country-esque blues".<ref>Watrous, "Lonnie Mack in a Melange of Guitar Styles", New York Times, September 18, 1988. See also, Davis, ''The History of the Blues'', Da Capo Press, 1995, at p. 246, describing Mack's vocals as those of "a white Hoosier with a touch of black Memphis in his soul."</ref> His best-known vocals were gospel-inspired "blue-eyed soul" ballads. Most failed to chart,<ref>(1) "Baby, What's Wrong?" hit the low end of the charts at 93 in December 1963. See, Billboard's "Chart History" list for Mack at http://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719031335/https://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart |date=July 19, 2018 }}. (2) The blue-eyed soul vocals on Mack's debut album, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963) came at a time when the racial divide in American culture was epitomized by the difference between black and white pop music styles. (Kirkus Review of the book, ''Country Soul'', by Charles L. Hughes, U. of North Carolina Press, 2015, at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-i-hughes/country-soul/). When Mack's first vocal recordings were released in 1963, Mack's gospel-inspired version of the soul ballad "Where There's a Will" was played on R&B radio stations throughout the Deep South. Soon, he was invited to give a live radio interview with a prominent R&B disc jockey in racially polarized Birmingham, Alabama. Mack said that when he appeared at the
radio station, the DJ said, "Baby, you're the wrong color" and canceled the interview on the spot. After that, Mack's vocals received little play on R&B radio stations.

Lovett began his music career as a singer-songwriter. By the early 1980s, Lovett had already distinguished himself in the burgeoning [[Texas]] folk acoustic scene.  He had performed in the New Folk competition at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]] in 1980 and 1982.<ref name = "KFF">"Kerrville Folk Festival Finalist History", compiled by Doug Coppock ([http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220031051/http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp |date=February 20, 2006}})</ref> An American singer, Buffalo Wayne, whom he had met in 1978 during a college trip to Germany, invited Lovett to play with him at the 1983 [[Schueberfouer]] in Luxembourg.

Lovett was given an award called an "Esky" for Surest Thing in [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire's]] 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue.

In 2010, Lovett appeared on an episode of ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]'' that also featured [[John Prine]] and [[Ray LaMontagne]].

'''Martin David Robinson''' (September 26, 1925&nbsp;– December 8, 1982), known professionally as '''Marty Robbins''', was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and [[NASCAR]] [[racing driver]]. Robbins was one of the most popular and successful [[Country music|country and western]] singers for most of his nearly four-decade career,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marty-robbins-mn0000858710/biography |title=Marty Robbins Biography |publisher=AllMusic, RhythmOne, LLC |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/marty-robbins-20651271#mainstream-success |title=Marty Robbins Biography |publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/marty-robbins/biography/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228123352/http://www.cmt.com/artists/marty-robbins/biography/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2012 |title=About Marty Robbins |publisher=Country Music Television, Inc., a division of Viacom International Inc. |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref> which spanned from the late 1940s to the early 1980s. He was also an early [[outlaw country]] pioneer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Max|date=2018|title=Down in the Hole: Outlaw Country and Outlaw Culture|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/scu.2018.0034|journal=Southern Cultures|volume=24|issue=3|pages=83–100|doi=10.1353/scu.2018.0034|s2cid=149612754|issn=1534-1488}}</ref>

Born in [[Glendale, Arizona]], Robbins taught himself guitar while serving in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]], and subsequently drew fame performing in clubs in and around his hometown. In 1952, he released his first No. 1 country song, "[[I'll Go On Alone]]". Four years later, he released his second No.1 hit “[[Singing the Blues]]”, and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, "[[A White Sport Coat]]" and "[[The Story of My Life (Marty Robbins song)|The Story of My Life]]". In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", for which he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. The song began Robbins' association with [[Western music (North America)|western]] balladry, a style which would become a staple of his career. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]", "[[Big Iron]]", “[[Devil Woman (Marty Robbins song)|Devil Woman]]” and "Honkytonk Man", the last for which the [[Honkytonk Man|1982 Clint Eastwood film]] is named, and in which Robbins made his final appearance before his death.

Over the course of his career, Robbins recorded more than [[Marty Robbins discography|500 songs and 60 albums]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and was named the 1960s Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. His songs "El Paso" and "Big Iron" were ranked by the [[Western Writers of America]] among the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Robbins was a commercial success in both the country and pop genres, and his songs were covered by many other famous artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. Johnny Cash noted, "there's no greater country singer than Marty Robbins."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cash|first1=Johnny|title=Johnny Cash: The Last Interview: and Other Conversations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74zsDwAAQBAJ|year=2021|isbn=978-1-612-19893-4|page=53|publisher=[[Melville House Publishing]]}}</ref> His music continues to have an influence in pop culture today, featuring prominently in several films, television shows and video games.

Robbins was born Martin David Robinson on September 26, 1925, in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]].<ref name="Biography.com">{{cite web  |title=Marty Robbins |url=https://www.biography.com/musician/marty-robbins |website=Biography |date=August 12, 2020 |access-date=15 December 2021 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Pruett | first = Barbara J. | title = Marty Robbins: Fast Cars and Country Music | year = 2007 | publisher = Scarecrow Press | isbn = 9780810860360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otDFSIwdsSIC&pg=PA522 | access-date = 2014-04-24}}</ref> His parents, John "Jack" Robinson (1889-1975) and Emma Robinson (1889-1970)<ref name=":0" /> divorced in 1937.<ref name="Biography.com"/>

Among the warmer memories of his childhood, Robbins recalled having listened to stories of the [[American West]] told by his maternal grandfather, 'Texas Bob' Heckle (1847-1931),<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2019-01-14 |title=Robert Matthew Heckle |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Robert-Heckle/6000000014254248286 |access-date=2024-06-11 |website=geni_family_tree |language=en-US}}</ref> who was a traveling salesman, raconteur and local [[medicine man]].<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Rhymes of the Frontier|date=1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPxoHAAACAAJ|access-date=2014-10-25|last1=" Heckle|first1="Texas Bob}}</ref> 
Robbins later recalled: "He had two little books of poetry he would sell. I used to sing him church songs and he would tell me stories. A lot of the songs I've written were brought about because of stories he told me. Like 'Big Iron' I wrote because he was a Texas Ranger. At least he told me he was".<ref name="Biography.com"/>

Robbins dropped out of high school in [[Glendale, Arizona]], before his time in the Navy. Robbins would work as an amateur boxer, dig ditches, drive trucks, deliver ice, and serve as a mechanics helper.<ref>"Marty Robbins Obituary" December 8th 1982. The New York Times.</ref>

At 17, Robbins left home to serve in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] as an [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] [[coxswain]] during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. To pass the time during the war, he learned to play the guitar, started writing songs,<ref name=pc10/> and came to love [[Hawaiian music]].

After his [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the military in 1947 and his marriage the following year, Robbins began to play at local [[Music venue|venues]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]],<ref name=pc10/> In the early 1950s Marty moved on to [[Host (radio)|host]] his own show on [[KIHP (AM)|KTYL]] and then his own television show "''Western Caravan''" on [[KPHO|KPHO-TV]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. After [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] made a [[guest appearance]] on Robbins' TV show, Dickens got Robbins a [[record deal]] with [[Columbia Records]].

==Career==

Robbins became known for his appearances at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. Music journalist [[Mary Harron]] wrote the following about him in ''The Guardian'':<ref>{{Cite web| title = Marty Robbins: Country Dude of Nashville. By Mary Harron : Articles, reviews and interviews from Rock's Backpages.| access-date = 2018-06-25| url = https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/marty-robbins-country-dude-of-nashville |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>
<blockquote>Robbins was a symbol of the Nashville establishment that younger [[Country music|country]] fans abandoned in the Seventies for the bleached-denim "[[outlaw country|outlaw school]]" of [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] side of [[Country music|country]] in songs like ''White Sport Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>

In 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5). In addition to his recordings and performances, Robbins was an avid [[race car]] driver, [[Competition|competing]] in 35 career [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] races with six top-10 finishes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Marty_Robbins |title=Career Statistics |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> including the 1973 [[1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400|Firecracker 400]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1973_Medal_Of_Honor_Firecracker_400/W |title=1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400 |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date=1973-07-04 |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> In 1967, Robbins played himself in the car racing film ''[[Hell on Wheels (1967 film)|Hell on Wheels]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061757/ |publisher=IMDb.com|title=Hell on Wheels|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Robbins was partial to [[Dodge]]s prepared by [[NASCAR]] Hall-of-Famer [[Cotton Owens]], and owned and raced [[Dodge Charger|Chargers]] and then a 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]]. He was also the driver of the 60th [[Indianapolis 500]] [[Buick Century]] [[pace car]] in [[1976 Indianapolis 500|1976]]. His last race was in a [[Junior Johnson]]-built 1982 [[Buick Regal]] in the [[Atlanta Journal 500]] on November 7, 1982, a month before his death.

==Death==
Robbins developed [[cardiovascular disease]] early in life. After his third heart attack on December 2, 1982, he underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple coronary bypass surgery]]. He did not recover and died six days later, on December 8, at [[St. Thomas Hospital (Nashville, Tennessee)|St. Thomas Hospital]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].  He was 57 years old.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pareles | first = Jon | date = 1982-12-10 | title = Marty Robbins, Singer, 57; Won a Grammy for 'El Paso' | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/obituaries/marty-robbins-singer-57-won-a-grammy-for-el-paso.html | newspaper = New York Times | location = New York, NY | access-date = 2016-10-12 }}</ref>

==Music and honors==
Although by 1960 Robbins' output was largely western (and some country) music, his initial hits like "Singing the Blues", "Knee Deep in the Blues", "The Story of My Life", "She Was Only Seventeen", and "[[A White Sport Coat|A White Sport Coat and a Pink Carnation]]" were generally regarded as more pop/teen idol material than his hits from 1960 onwards ("El Paso" etc.).

His musical accomplishments include the [[Grammy Award]] for his 1959 hit and signature song "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", taken from his album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. "El Paso" was his first song to hit No. 1 on the pop chart in the 1960s. It was followed up, successfully, by "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]", which reached No. 3 on the pop chart in 1961, becoming his third, and last, Top 10 pop hit. "El Paso" was followed by one prequel and one sequel: "Feleena (From El Paso)" and "[[El Paso City (song)|El Paso City]]". Also in 1961, Robbins wrote the words and music and recorded "I Told the Brook",<ref>{{cite book|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/836715 |title=I told the brook [music&#93; / [by&#93; Marty Robbins; arr. by Alec Baynes &#124; National Library of Australia |year=1961 |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> a ballad later recorded by [[Billy Thorpe]].

He won the [[Grammy Award]] for the Best Country & Western Recording 1961 for his follow-up album ''[[More Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', and was awarded the [[Grammy Award]] for Best Country Song in 1970, for "My Woman, My Woman, My Wife". Robbins was named Artist of the Decade (1960–1969) by the [[Academy of Country Music]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1982, was rewarded three awards at the 17th Annual Music City News Country Awards in 1983, and was given a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] in 1998 for his song "El Paso".

When Robbins was recording his 1961 hit "Don't Worry" at the [[Bradley Studios]] in Nashville, session guitarist [[Grady Martin]] accidentally created the electric guitar "[[Distortion (music)|fuzz" effect]]&nbsp;– his six-string bass was run through a faulty channel in the studio's [[mixing console]]. Robbins decided to keep it in the final version.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&q=%22Don't+Worry%22+%22Marty+Robbins%22+distortion&pg=PA75 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins – Diane Diekman – Google Books |date= February 15, 2012|isbn=9780252094200 |access-date=2015-08-17|last1=Diekman |first1=Diane |publisher=University of Illinois Press }}</ref> The song reached No. 1 on the country chart, and No. 3 on the pop chart.<ref>Joel Whitburn's Top Country Singles 1944–2001</ref>
Robbins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1975. For his contribution to the recording industry, Robbins has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

Robbins has been honored by many bands, including the [[Grateful Dead]] who covered "El Paso" and [[Bob Weir]] & Kingfish who covered "Big Iron". [[The Who]]'s 2006 album ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' includes the song "God Speaks of Marty Robbins". The song's composer, [[Pete Townshend]], explained that the song is about God deciding to create the universe just so he can hear some music, "and most of all, one of his best creations, Marty Robbins."<ref>[http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103040202/http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr|date=January 3, 2007}}</ref> The [[Beasts of Bourbon]] released a song called "The Day Marty Robbins Died" on their 1984 debut album ''The Axeman's Jazz''. Both [[Frankie Laine]] and [[Elvis Presley]], among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song "[[You Gave Me a Mountain]]", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded "You Gave Me a Mountain" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. [[Johnny Cash]] recorded a version of "[[Big Iron]]" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the ''Cash Unearthed'' box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including "I Couldn't Keep From Crying", "Kate" and "Song Of The Patriot". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on [[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|his network TV show]]. "Big Iron" was also covered by [[Mike Ness]] on his album ''[[Under the Influences]]'', on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', gained renewed popularity following its use in the 2010 video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.

His song "El Paso" was featured in the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|series finale]] of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.  'El Paso' was also featured in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' prequel made by the [[BBC]].

Robbins was awarded an honorary degree by [[Northern Arizona University]].

In 2001, singer-songwriter [[Don McLean]] released his album, ''[[Sings Marty Robbins]]'', which features a collection of songs recorded by Robbins in his career.

In 2016, a portion of Glendale Avenue in Robbins' hometown of [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Arizona]], was renamed "Marty Robbins Boulevard".<ref>[https://ktar.com/story/1290175/portion-of-glendale-avenue-renamed-for-legendary-country-singer/ "Portion of Glendale Avenue renamed for legendary country singer"]. [[KTAR-FM]], September 27, 2016.</ref>

Before Robbins died, he held a performance at the [[White House]], alongside famous American singer [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>"Marty Robbins Obituary" December 10th 1982 The New York Times</ref>

He was named Man of the Decade by the [[List of Academy of Country Music Awards ceremonies#1970s|Academy of Country Music]] in 1970.

== Political views ==
{{Further|Ain't I Right}}
Robbins' political views remained firmly right-wing during his lifetime. During the 1960s as the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] strengthened,  Robbins' political views turned to the right.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Meir |first=Kenneth |title=Looking for Meaning in All the Wrong Places: Country Music and the Politics of Identity |url=https://dra.american.edu/islandora/object/auislandora%3A78317/datastream/PDF/download |journal=Social Science Quarterly |volume=100 |date=February 2019 |pages=89–108|doi=10.1111/ssqu.12556 }}</ref> He supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in his [[1964 United States presidential election]] campaign as a southern director for "Stars for Barry". Two of his songs, "[[Ain't I Right]]" and "My Own Native Land" written in the 1960s later became popular songs during the conservative resurgence in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marty Robbins and the Case for PC {{!}} ColumbusFreePress.com |url=https://columbusfreepress.com/article/marty-robbins-and-case-pc |access-date=2023-08-23 |website=columbusfreepress.com}}</ref> The lyrics of "Ain't I Right" describe [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protesters]] as [[fifth column]]ists and [[Communists in the United States|communists.]]<ref name="Lyrics2">{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Ain%27t+I+Right |website=lyricfind.com |publisher=lyricfind |access-date=22 October 2020 |language=en|title=Ain't I Right?}}</ref> After Columbia Records refused to publish his more politically charged songs, Robbins' band member Bobby Sykes recorded the songs for [[Sims Records]] under the name Johnny Freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diekman |first=Diane |date=2012 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&q=marty+robbins+aint+i+right&pg=PA99 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=99 |isbn=978-0252081255 }}</ref>

==Racing career==
Robbins loved [[NASCAR]] racing.  With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted. Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes in his career, with a personal best top 5 finish at the 1974 [[Motor State 360]] in Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1974_Motor_State_360/W |date=June 16, 1974 |title=1974 Motor State 360 |work=racing-reference.info |access-date=February 17, 2021}}</ref>

Robbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens. Robbins had a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973–1974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.

In 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it.  He had knocked the [[NASCAR]]-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he "just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage – Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

Robbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.

In 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].

Robbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in [[Southern California]] and raced on the Vintage [[NASCAR]] club circuit.

In 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' [[NASCAR]] racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].

For the 2016 [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins. For the [[2021 Goodyear 400]], [[Tyler Reddick]]'s RCR #8 [[Nascar]] Cup car carries Robbins' signature magenta and chartreuse livery. For the [[2022 Goodyear 400|2022 running]], [[Corey LaJoie]]’s [[Spire Motorsports]] #7 ran a throwback to Robbins’ infamous 777 car that he ran in his career.

==Discography==
{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}
Robbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.

Robbins' highest-charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, "[[A White Sport Coat]]" charted to #2, and in 1961, "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]" charted to #3.

His final Top 10 single was "Honkytonk Man" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.

'''Matt Minglewood''' (born '''Roy Alexander Batherson''', 31 January 1947) is a Canadian musician whose style can be described as a blend of [[country music|country]], [[blues music|blues]], [[folk music|folk]], [[Traditional music|roots]] and rock. The name "Matt" was borrowed from his brother, Matt Batherson.

== Career ==
Born in [[Moncton, New Brunswick]], Minglewood later relocated to [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia]] with his family. He later moved to nearby [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]] where he resides to the present day. His nephew [[Norm Batherson]] played hockey professionally, and his grand-nephew [[Drake Batherson]] is currently a [[Winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] for the [[Ottawa Senators]] of the National Hockey League.<ref>{{cite web |title=Drake Batherson |url=https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/195192/drake-batherson |website=eliteprospects.com |access-date=20 December 2020}}</ref>

Minglewood joined his first band, the Rockin' Saints, when he was in his late teens, playing local high school dances, and even tavern gigs before he was old enough to get into bars. He played organ and rhythm guitar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dillon |first1=Charlotte |title=Artist Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/matt-minglewood-mn0000970507 |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=20 December 2020}}</ref>

When he was in his early twenties he was part of a band called 'Sam Moon, Matt Minglewood & The Universal Power'. The group was formed in 1969 with Sam Moon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsclassicrock.8m.com/sammoon.html/|title=Sam Moon|publisher=Nova Scotia Classic Rock|first=Peter|last=Crowe|accessdate=19 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511121042/http://nsclassicrock.8m.com/sammoon.html|archive-date=11 May 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Minglewood sharing vocal duties. The band soon changed their name to Moon – Minglewood and performed regularly in the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax/Dartmouth metro area]], becoming a staple at local high school dances in the area.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Minglewood briefly sang lead vocals and played guitar for Pepper Tree, then formed Cold Duck, and then in 1974 formed [[The Minglewood Band]], a band which toured Canada extensively and achieved a measure of national success. The Minglewood Band recorded their first album with Solar Records in 1975. Soon after the album was released they signed a [[Major label#Major labels|major label]] deal with [[RCA Records]]. The group received a 1980 [[Juno Award]] nomination for the [[Juno Award for New Group of the Year|Most Promising Group of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Past nominees and winners |url=https://junoawards.ca/awards/past-winners-nominees/?search_year_val1=1970&search_year_val2=1981&search_category_val=&award_name=&search_wins_val=no&tag_search_val=Minglewood+Band&submit=submit |website=junoawards.ca |access-date=20 December 2020}}</ref>

From 1984 to 1985, Minglewood took a sabbatical before launching a solo career. In the mid 1980s to early 1990s he was also part of an annual seasonal [[Dance troupe|troupe]] called the Cape Breton Summertime Revue, consisting of about 12 members performing musical and comedy skits for all ages throughout the [[Maritimes]].{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

'''Merle Robert Travis''' (November 29, 1917 – October 20, 1983) was an American [[country music|country and western]] singer, songwriter, and guitarist born in [[Rosewood, Kentucky]], United States.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1189}}</ref> His songs' lyrics often discussed both the lives and the economic exploitation of American coal miners. Among his many well-known songs and recordings are "[[Sixteen Tons]]", "Re-Enlistment Blues", "[[I am a Pilgrim]]" and "[[Dark as a Dungeon]]". However, it is his unique guitar style, still called "[[Fingerstyle guitar#Travis picking|Travis picking]]" by guitarists, as well as his interpretations of the rich musical traditions of his native [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]], for which he is best known today. Travis picking is a syncopated style of guitar [[pattern picking|fingerpicking]] rooted in [[ragtime]] music in which alternating chords and bass notes are plucked by the thumb while melodies are simultaneously plucked by the index finger. He was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970 and elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1977.<ref name="Larkin"/>

==Biography==
===Early years===
Merle Travis was born and raised in [[Muhlenberg County]], Kentucky, a place which would inspire many of Travis' original songs. (This is the same coal mining county mentioned in the [[John Prine]] song "Paradise".) He became interested in the guitar early in life and originally played one made by his brother.&nbsp;Travis reportedly saved his money to buy a guitar for which he had window-shopped for some time.

Merle's guitar playing style was developed out of a native tradition of [[fingerpicking]] in western Kentucky. Among its early practitioners was the black country blues guitarist [[Arnold Shultz]].<ref>Lightfoot, William E. 1990.

"The evolution of country fingerpicking"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930224258/http://www.debed.com/lanham/teocfp.htm |date=September 30, 2018 }}</ref> Shultz taught his style to several local musicians, including [[Kennedy Jones (musician)|Kennedy Jones]], who passed it on to other guitarists, notably [[Mose Rager]], a part-time barber and coal miner, and [[Ike Everly]], the father of [[The Everly Brothers]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Their thumb and index fingerpicking method created a solo style that blended lead lines picked by the finger and rhythmic bass patterns picked or strummed by the thumbpick. This technique captivated many guitarists in the region and provided the main inspiration to young Travis. Travis acknowledged his debt to both Rager and Everly,<ref name=pc9>{{Pop Chronicles |9|2}}</ref> and appears with Rager on the DVD ''Legends of Country Guitar'' (Vestapol, 2002).

At the age of 18, Travis performed "Tiger Rag" on a local radio amateur show in [[Evansville, Indiana]], leading to offers of work with local bands. In 1937 Travis was hired by fiddler [[Clayton McMichen]] as guitarist in his Georgia Wildcats. He later joined the Drifting Pioneers, a Chicago-area gospel quartet<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/groups/story/index.php?groupid=12159|title=Drifting Pioneers|website=Hillbilly-music.com}}</ref> that moved to WLW radio in Cincinnati, the major country music station north of Nashville. Travis' style amazed everyone at WLW and he became a popular member of their barn dance radio show the ''Boone County Jamboree'' when it began in 1938. He performed on various weekday programs, often working with other WLW acts including [[Grandpa Jones|Louis Marshall "Grandpa" Jones]], the [[Delmore Brothers]], (in Alton Delmore's book ''Truth is Stranger Than Publicity'' on pages 274–275, Alton describes how he taught Merle Travis how to read and write music)<ref>''Truth is Stranger Than Publicity'', 1995 ed.</ref> [[Hank Penny]] and [[Joe Maphis]], all of whom became lifelong friends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=191|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232445/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=191|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 26, 2007|title=MERLE TRAVIS &#124; Country Music Hall of Fame® and Museum &#124; Nashville, Tennessee|date=September 26, 2007}}</ref>

In 1943, he and [[Grandpa Jones]] recorded for Cincinnati used-record dealer [[Syd Nathan]], who had founded a new label, [[King Records (USA)|King Records]].&nbsp;Because WLW barred their staff musicians from recording, Travis and Jones used the pseudonym The Sheppard Brothers. Their recording of "You'll Be Lonesome Too" was the first to be released by King Records, subsequently known for its country recordings by the Delmore Brothers and Stanley Brothers as well as R&B musicians [[Hank Ballard]], [[Wynonie Harris]] and most notably [[James Brown]].

With [[World War II]] and the threat of being [[Conscription|drafted]], Travis enlisted in the [[US Marine Corps]]. His stint as a marine was very brief, and he returned to Cincinnati.<ref>An interview with Merle Travis {{citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVYHSaHcYco |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/SVYHSaHcYco |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|title=Yesteryear in Nashville|access-date=July 10, 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref> When the Drifting Pioneers left radio station WLW, leaving a half-hour hole in the schedule that needed filling, Merle, Grandpa Jones and the Delmore Brothers formed a gospel group called "The Brown's Ferry Four" .&nbsp;Performing a repertoire of traditional white and black gospel songs, with Merle singing bass, they became one of the most popular country gospel groups of the time, recording nearly four dozen sides for the King label between 1946 and 1952. The Brown's Ferry Four has been called "possibly the best white gospel group ever."<ref>by William E. Lightfoot, 2003. The Three Doc(k)s: White Blues in Appalachia, ''Black Music Research Journal'', Vol. 23, No. 1/2, pp. 167–193; see also [https://web.archive.org/web/20050118014638/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/brown_s_ferry_four/bio.jhtml "Brown's Ferry Four" by Bruce Eder, Allmusic]</ref>

During this period, Travis appeared in several [[soundies]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871419/|title=Merle Travis|website=IMDb}}</ref> an early form of music video intended for visual jukeboxes where customers could view as well as hear the popular performers of the day. His first soundie was "Night Train To Memphis" with the band [[Jimmy Wakely]] and his Oklahoma Cowboys and Girls, including [[Johnny Bond]] and Wesley Tuttle along with Colleen Summers (who later married [[Les Paul]] and became [[Mary Ford]]). His performance of "Why'd I Fall For Abner" with [[Carolina Cotton]] was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''Soundies''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/music/news/e3i835a22449db56a47b99fe7e59191fa6e|title=Liberation sets 'Soundies' free|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Several years later he recorded a set of [[Snader Telescriptions]], short music videos intended for local television stations needing "filler" programming.&nbsp;His performances included playful duets with his then-wife Judy Hayden as well as several songs from his 1947 album ''Folk Songs from the Hills'' (see below).

===Career peak===
Travis performed in stage shows and landed bit parts and singing roles in several B westerns. He recorded for small labels there until 1946 when he was signed to Hollywood-based [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Early hits like "Cincinnati Lou", "[[No Vacancy (Merle Travis song)|No Vacancy]]", "[[Divorce Me C.O.D.]]", "Sweet Temptation", "[[So Round, So Firm, So Fully Packed]]", and "Three Times Seven", all his own compositions, gave him national prominence,<ref name="Larkin"/> although they did not all showcase the guitar work that Travis was renowned for among his peers.&nbsp;His design for a solid body electric guitar, built for him by [[Paul Bigsby]] with a single row of tuners, is thought to have inspired longtime Travis pal [[Leo Fender]]'s design of the famous [[Telecaster|Broadcaster]] in 1950.<ref name="Larkin"/> The Travis-Bigsby guitar now resides in the Music Hall of Fame Museum.

In 1946, asked to record an album of folk songs, Travis combined traditional songs with several original compositions recalling his family's days working in the mines. The result was released as the 4-disk 78 rpm box set ''[[Folk Songs of the Hills]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/>&nbsp;This album, featuring Travis accompanied only on his guitar, contains his two most enduring songs, both centered on the lives of coal miners: "[[Sixteen Tons]]" and "[[Dark as a Dungeon]]".<ref name="Larkin"/>

"Sixteen Tons" became a No. 1 ''Billboard'' country hit for [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] in 1955<ref name=pc9/> and has been recorded many times over the years. Travis and [[Molly Bee]] appeared together as guests on November 24, 1960, on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/FORDSHOW-SEASON5.html|title=The Ford Show. Season Five. 1960-'61|website=Ernieford.com|access-date=February 11, 2015}}</ref> The darkly philosophical "Dark As A Dungeon", although never a hit single, became a folk standard during the 1960s [[folk revival]], and has been covered by many artists including [[Johnny Cash]] in his best-selling concert album ''[[At Folsom Prison]]'', by [[Dolly Parton]] on her ''[[9 to 5 and Odd Jobs]]'' album and by Travis himself, along with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] in the landmark 1972 album ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/>&nbsp;In spite of its initial lack of commercial success, ''Folk Songs of the Hills'', with added tracks, has remained in print virtually ever since.

Travis was a popular radio performer throughout the 1940s and 1950s.&nbsp;He appeared on many country music television shows, co-hosting a show "Merle Travis and Company" with his wife Judy Hayden around 1953. He was a regular member of the Hollywood Barn dance broadcast over radio station KNX, Hollywood, and of the Town Hall Party, which was broadcast first as a radio show on KXLA out of Pasadena, California and later as a TV series in 1953–1961. However, his personal life became increasingly troubled. A heavy drinker and at times desperately insecure despite his multitude of talents (including prose writing, taxidermy, cartooning and watch repair), he was involved in various violent incidents in California, and he married several times in the course of his life.&nbsp;He suffered from serious stage fright, though amazed fellow performers added that once onstage, he was an effective and even charismatic performer. In spite of his problems he was respected and admired by his friends and fellow musicians. Longtime Travis fan [[Doc Watson]] named his son Merle Watson, and Travis admirer [[Chet Atkins]] named his daughter Merle Atkins, in Travis' honor.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Travis' string of chart-topping [[honky tonk music|honky-tonk]] hits in the 1940s did not continue into the 1950s, despite the reverence of friends like Grandpa Jones and [[Hank Thompson (music)|Hank Thompson]], with whom he toured and recorded as lead guitarist (Thompson, who could pick Travis-style, even had [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] design him a Super 400 hollow body electric guitar identical to the one Travis began using in 1952.) Travis continued recording for Capitol in the 1950s, broadening his repertoire to include new guitar instrumentals, blues and boogie numbers. His uptempo single "Merle's Boogie Woogie" showed him working with multi-part disc recording at the same time as Les Paul.

He found greater exposure after an appearance in the successful 1953 movie ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' singing and playing "Reenlistment Blues", and following the success of his friend [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s million-selling rendition of "[[Sixteen Tons]]" in 1955.<ref name="Larkin"/>&nbsp;His reputation as a folk-inspired singer-composer and guitarist grew after the appearance of the album ''[[The Merle Travis Guitar]]'' in 1956, the reissue of ''[[Folk Songs of the Hills]]'' with four additional tracks under the title ''[[Back Home (Merle Travis album)|Back Home]]'' in 1957, and ''[[Walkin' the Strings]]'' in 1960, the latter two of which won 5-star ratings from ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. His career acquired a second wind during the [[American folk music revival]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, leading to appearances at clubs, folk festivals and at [[Carnegie Hall]] as a guest of [[Flatt and Scruggs|Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs]] in 1962. In the mid-1960s he moved to Nashville and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]].&nbsp;During this time he became a close friend and occasional hunting partner of [[Johnny Cash]].

===Guitar style===
Merle Travis is now acknowledged as one of the most influential American guitarists of the 20th century. His unique guitar style inspired many guitarists who followed, most notably [[Chet Atkins]], who first heard Travis's radio broadcasts on Cincinnati's WLW ''Boone County Jamboree'' in 1939 while living with his father in rural Georgia.&nbsp;Among the many other guitarists influenced by Travis are [[Scotty Moore]], [[Earl Hooker]], [[Lonnie Mack]], [[Doc Watson]] and [[Marcel Dadi]]. His son, [[Thom Bresh]] (1948–2022), had continued playing in Travis's style on a custom-made ''Langejans Dualette''.

Although his early tutors were among the first to use the thumbpick in guitar playing, freeing the fingers to pick melody, Travis' style, according to Chet Atkins, went on in musical directions "never dreamt about" by his predecessors.<ref name="ReferenceA">Chet Atkins, liner notes to 1996 reissue of the album ''Walkin' the Strings''</ref> His trademark mature style incorporated elements from [[ragtime]], [[blues]], [[boogie]], [[jazz]] and [[Western swing]], and was marked by rich [[chord progression]]s, [[harmonics]], [[slide (guitar technique)|slides]] and [[bend (guitar)|bends]], and rapid changes of [[key (music)|key]].&nbsp;He could shift quickly from [[finger-picking]] to [[flatpicking]] in the midst of a number by gripping his thumbpick like a flat pick. In his hands, the guitar resembled a full band. As his son [[Thom Bresh]] puts it, on first hearing his father as a child "I thought it was just the coolest sound, because it sounded like a whole bunch of instruments coming from one guitar. In it, I heard rhythm parts, I heard melodies, I heard chords and all this wrapped up in one."<ref>Gold 2006.</ref> Equally at home on acoustic and electric guitar, Travis was one of the first to exploit the full range of techniques and sonorities available on the electric guitar.

Though Chet Atkins was the most prominent guitarist to be inspired by Merle Travis, the two players' styles were significantly different. As Atkins explained, "While I play alternate bass strings which sounds more like a stride piano style, Merle played two bass strings simultaneously on the one and three beats, producing a more exciting solo rhythm, in my opinion. It was somewhat reminiscent of the great old black players."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The resemblance was no coincidence; Travis himself acknowledged the influence of black guitarists such as [[Blind Blake]], the foremost ragtime and blues guitarist of the late 1920s and early 1930s.<ref>Ferris, William R., Michael K. Honey and Pete Seeger,"Pete Seeger, San Francisco, 1989", ''Southern Cultures'' Volume 13.3, Fall 2007, pp. 5–38</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOKZKESWys0C&q=%22is+acknowledged+by+Travis+himself%22&pg=PA14|title=Encyclopedia of the Blues-2nd (p)|first=Gérard|last=Herzhaft|date=September 29, 1992|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|page=14|isbn=9781610751391|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Travis' style is explained and exemplified by [[Marcel Dadi]] on the DVD ''The Guitar of Merle Travis'', which includes live video performances by Travis of classics such as "John Henry" and "Nine Pound Hammer" as well as transcriptions of Travis solos in [[tablature]].<ref>Available from Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop GW 918, 1993</ref>

===Late career===
After a career dip during which he struggled to overcome alcohol and drug abuse,<ref name="Larkin"/> Travis put his career back on track in the 1970s. He appeared frequently on such country music TV shows as ''The Porter Wagoner Show'', ''The Johnny Cash Show'', ''Austin City Limits'', ''Grand Old Country'', and ''Nashville Swing''; and his featured performances on the 1972 [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] album ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' introduced him to a new generation of [[Americana (music)|roots music]] enthusiasts. His 1974 album of duets with Chet Atkins, ''[[The Atkins - Travis Traveling Show]]'', won a [[Grammy]] award in the category "Best Country Instrumental", and a later album ''Travis Pickin''' received another nomination. In 1976, he contributed to the musical score of the [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary [[Harlan County, USA]]. Toward the end of the 1970s, he signed a new contract with the Los-Angeles-based country music label [[CMH Records|CMH]], which launched one of the most prolific recording periods in his career. The many titles that followed included new guitar solo albums, duets with [[Joe Maphis]], a blues album, and a double album tribute to the country fiddler [[Clayton McMichen]], with whom he had played in the 1930s.

In 1983, Travis died of a [[heart attack]] at his [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]] home.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/22/obituaries/merle-travis-country-singer.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftl1y-la3HNDmwYiOMfApSd8l3MaLEkYtYp2zneWMVILr40Afd10-lDJV0oUAiurZae3pQZJiF_4aSCYlQL5bOfF7Yp7W2tKWCjNOZ0wLD470zXOjLoXvTA1X0mIxJi85VjaVGs3SAXz_2VQLR23dgpiPl1FYk6EWlbHFSCvPbvAhV-KY_GOkmasl9qLrkfDTLDntec6KYCdxFQDD_FS3B54WU66bBMKY9dffa_f1N7Jp2I0fhGAXdoLYypG5Q0W4HS8r1uurPOohGOo9Gk9HA1I7NlcDgG9w_XD96nVQ&smid=url-share|title=New York Times, October 22, 1983, Section 1, Page 28|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 22, 1983 |access-date=June 4, 2022}}</ref> His body was cremated and his ashes scattered around a memorial erected to him near [[Drakesboro, Kentucky]].

==Legacy==
[[File:MerleTravisand Guitar.jpg|thumb|right|Merle Travis and his Gibson Super 400 at the Country Music Hall of Fame]]
Although many of his original LP albums are still unissued on CD, Travis' posthumous discography continues to grow, due in large part to the efforts of independent labels. A live concert album ''Merle Travis in Boston 1959'' released by [[Rounder Records]] in 1993 documents Travis' singing and guitar work still at its peak. A major retrospective of Travis' work and career (''Guitar Rags and a Too Fast Past'', five CDs with an 80-page booklet authored by Rich Kienzle, who interviewed many of Travis' contemporaries) was produced by [[Bear Family Records]] in 1994, and includes much previously unreleased material. The Country Routes label has issued several transcriptions of his radio broadcasts of the 1940s and 1950s. Several recent DVDs published by Vestapol and Bear Family have collected many of his music videos and television appearances. He was an honoree of the two-hour television special ''An Evening of Country Greats: A Hall of Fame Celebration'' in 1996, and two classic Travis performances were included in the four-part PBS television documentary ''American Roots Music'' in 2001, available in CD and DVD formats.

He was associated with the hillbilly boogie style which influenced [[rockabilly]]. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] cited him as a major influence on his own singing and piano playing.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moon Mullican {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |access-date=2021-03-21 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Mullican was born to Oscar Luther Mullican (1876–1961) and his first wife, Virginia Jordan Mullican (1880–1915), near Corrigan, [[Polk County, Texas|Polk County]], [[Texas]], United States.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  They were a farming family of Scottish, Irish and Eastern European ancestry. His [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] immigrant ancestor, James Mullikin, was born in Scotland, arriving in [[Maryland, United States]] in the 1630s from Northern Ireland. His paternal grandfather was Pvt. Wilson G. Mullican, who served in the [[6th Mississippi Infantry Regiment]], [[Confederate States Army]], at the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Mullican's parents, stepmother, and grandparents are all buried in Stryker Cemetery, Polk County, Texas.

==Beginnings in music==
As a child Mullican began playing the organ, which his religious father had purchased in order to better sing hymns at church.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> However, Moon made friends with Joe Jones, a black sharecropper on the family farm, who introduced him to the [[country blues]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Moon's parents did not always approve, and he was torn between playing [[religious music|religious]] and [[secular music|secular]] music. After making his mark as a local piano player, Mullican left home at age 16, going to [[Houston]], where he performed and sang in local clubs.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

By the 1930s, Mullican had acquired his nickname "Moon". Although published sources suggest it is short for "[[moonshine]]" or possibly from his all-night performances;<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> his family says it was because he loved to play "Shoot the Moon", a variation of the [[dominoes]] game "[[42 (dominoes)|42]]".  It is also highly likely the widely popular syndicated [[comic strip]] ''[[Moon Mullins]]'', which debuted in 1923, played a role in the similar nickname and alliteration sticking to Mullican.

==Early career==
His earliest influences were popular blues artists of the day such as [[Bessie Smith]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] and [[Leroy Carr]], together with country musicians including [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], and [[Bob Wills]].<ref name=spawner>{{cite web|title=MOON MULLICAN|url=http://www.webspawner.com/users/MoonMullican/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021182059/http://www.webspawner.com/users/MoonMullican/|archive-date=October 21, 2007}}</ref> In 1936, he covered [[Cab Calloway]]'s "Georgia Pine" and also sang his own compositions "Ain't You Kinda Sorry" and "Swing Baby Swing" for Leon Selph's [[Western swing]] band, The Blue Ridge Playboys.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  He played and recorded with [[Cliff Bruner]]'s Texas Wanderers, the Sunshine Boys, and [[Jimmie Davis]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> By the end of the 1930s, he had become a popular vocalist with a warm, deep, vocal delivery. Mullican frequently met up with another pianist, [[Black Boy Shine]], when performing around Houston. Combining nicknames, for a short time in the 1930s, they performed as a duo called "Moonshine".<ref name="Gato">{{cite web |url=https://gato-docs.its.txstate.edu/texas-music-history-online/Artists/Black-Boy-Shine/Black%20Boy%20Shine.pdf|title=Black Boy Shine|website=Gato-docs.its.txstate.edu|access-date=2020-09-30}}</ref>

In the early 1940s, he returned to the Texas Wanderers as lead singer and pianist, sang on the hits "Truck Driver's Blues" and "I'll Keep On Loving You".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> However, after leaving the band in 1942, he became a [[session musician]] playing on the songs of [[Floyd Tillman]], [[Ernest Tubb]], and [[Red Foley]].

==The Showboys==
In 1945, he put together his own band, The Showboys, who quickly became one of the most popular outfits in the Texas-Louisiana area with a mix of country music, Western swing, [[Cajun music]], and Mullican's wild piano playing and singing. Although their style was highly eclectic and included country ballads, some of their music clearly foreshadowed what would later be called [[rock and roll]]. In September 1946, Mullican cut 16 recordings as band leader, for [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in [[Cincinnati]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His first release, "The Lonesome Hearted Blues" b/w "It's a Sin to Love You Like I Do" sold quite well, but did not chart. His second release, "New Jole Blon" in December 1946 (later recorded by [[Doug Kershaw]]), reached number 2 on the [[Country and Western]] chart,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> sold one million copies<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Mullican was one of the highest-selling artists on [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]. Though not a major chart success, he was popular in the southeastern United States with records such as "The Leaves Mustn't Fall", "Hey Shah", "[[You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry]]", "Nine Tenths of the Tennessee River", and "I Was Sorta Wonderin'".

In the mid-1950s, many artists, such as [[Lefty Frizzell]] and [[George Jones]] experimented with rock and roll as its popularity began to gain ground on traditional country-and-western in the mid-1950s. Seeking some of that success, Mullican recorded four rock sides with [[Boyd Bennett]] and His Rockets, including "[[Seven Nights to Rock]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> However, both singles failed to chart. Before he signed to [[Coral Records|Coral]] in 1958, he had three other hits with King, including "Hey Shah".

==Later career==
In 1958, Mullican was signed by country music producer [[Owen Bradley]] to [[Decca Records]]' subsidiary label [[Coral Records]], and recorded more rock songs including "Moon's Rock" and "Sweet Rockin' Music". Devastated by the failure of his rock sides, [[Owen Bradley]] convinced Mullican to record his original songs in the burgeoning new more lush style of country music, the [[Nashville sound]]. However, Bradley was frustrated with Mullican; he reportedly said himself, "There was nothing I could do with him." Mullican, whose style was largely in traditional [[honky tonk music|honky tonk]], found it difficult to make such a large adjustment to his style and was dropped from Coral in 1959.

In the early 1960s, Mullican was a largely forgotten figure nationally, but based himself in Texas and carried on performing, recording then for the Starday and Spar labels. The decade saw him record country songs such as "I'll Pour the Wine" and "Love Don't Have a Guarantee", together with less notable novelties including "I Ain't No Beatle, But I Wanna Hold Your Hand".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> One of his last records was  "Love That Might Have Been". 

==Death==
In spite of having a heart condition Mullican continued to perform regularly. On New Year's Eve 1966 he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]], and died early in the morning on January 1, 1967, aged 57.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery, [[Beaumont, Texas]], the epitaph on his tombstone reading "I'll Sail My Ship Alone", the name of one of his many hits.

His wife Eunice (d. 1973) survived him; the couple was childless. 

==Influence==
{{more refs|section|date=February 2024}}
{{original research|section|date=February 2024}}
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Mullican influenced many other country artists. He had defined a style of country balladeering not hinted at in his 1930s work. This style of music influenced [[Jim Reeves]] (a band member for a while), [[Hank Williams]] (who named Mullican as a favorite artist), [[Hank Snow]], [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]], Elvis Presley, and especially Jerry Lee Lewis, who covered many of Mullican's songs. It was in the realm of hillbilly boogie, however, that Mullican had his greatest influence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Many of his songs, such as "Pipeliners Blues", "Hey! Mister Cotton-Picker" and "Cherokee Boogie" (his biggest hit, in 1951) foreshadowed a style adopted with widespread popularity by Haley and later rock and rollers. Mullican also influenced many others, including the Western swing band [[Asleep at the Wheel]], which recorded his song "Cherokee Boogie" on their 1973 album ''Comin' Right At Ya'', with several recording tribute CDs to mark Mullican's 100th birthday in 2009

Mullican is also believed to have co-written  "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]," a song made famous by Hank Williams that could not be credited to Mullican because of his contract with King Records.<ref name=amg>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography|title=Moon Mullican &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref> Mullican's recording of the song was released in July 1952, the same month as Williams' version, but differs significantly in having a different order of verses and extra rhyming couplets.

==Legacy==
In 1976, Mullican was posthumously inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. There have been many posthumous compilations of his music, on various labels including Ace and Bear Family.<ref name=amg />

Jones made her feature film debut as an actress in ''[[My Blueberry Nights]]'', which was released in 2007 and was directed by [[Wong Kar-Wai]].

Jones is the daughter of Indian [[sitar]]ist and composer [[Ravi Shankar]], and is the half-sister of fellow Indian musicians [[Anoushka Shankar]] and [[Shubhendra Shankar]].

==Early life==
Jones was born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979, in [[Manhattan]], New York City, to American concert producer Sue Jones and Indian Bengali musician [[Ravi Shankar]].<ref name="ABC"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Choudhury |first1=Uttara |title=Norah Jones says her dad Ravi Shankar will be 'greatly missed' - Firstpost |work=www.firstpost.com |url=https://www.firstpost.com/living/norah-jones-says-her-dad-ravi-shankar-will-be-greatly-missed-555511.html |access-date=July 31, 2018}}</ref> 

After her parents separated in 1986, Jones lived with her mother, growing up in [[Grapevine, Texas]]. As a child, Jones began singing in church and also took piano and voice lessons. She and her mother lived in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] when she was eleven years old.<ref name="NPR 2016 u316">{{cite web | title=< On Her Latest, Norah Jones Returns To Old Influences| website=NPR | date=15 October 2016 | url=https://www.npr.org/transcripts/496855218?storyId=496855218?storyId=496855218 | access-date=16 July 2024}}</ref> She attended Grapevine Middle School and [[Grapevine High School]] before transferring to [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]] in [[Dallas]]. Her music took its first form early on in the local Methodist Church where she regularly sang solos. While in high school, she sang in the school choir, participated in band, and played the alto saxophone. At the age of 16, with both parents' consent, she officially changed her name to Norah Jones.<ref name="ABC" /><ref name="NPR 2013 u316">{{cite web | title=Anoushka Shankar And Norah Jones: Half-Sisters Collaborate At Last | website=NPR | date=20 October 2013 | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/20/237107030/anoushka-shankar-and-norah-jones-half-sisters-collaborate-at-last | access-date=2 May 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hard to say no to free love: Ravi Shankar |work=Press Trust of India |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=April 29, 2003 |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/13ravi.htm |access-date=June 20, 2014}}</ref>

Jones always had an affinity for the music of [[Bill Evans]] and [[Billie Holiday]], among other "oldies". She once said, "My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and played that over and over again".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha.com/yasi/artists/details.html?CNTID=4102014&type=contemporary|work=Yamaha Artists Services, New York|title=Norah Jones|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref>

She attended [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] during the summers. While at high school, she won the ''[[Down Beat]]'' Student Music Awards for Best Jazz Vocalist (twice, in 1996 and 1997) and Best Original Composition (1996).<ref>{{cite magazine |access-date=May 21, 2008 |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=norah jones|bio=true}}|title=Norah Jones|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

Jones attended the [[University of North Texas]] (UNT), where she majored in jazz piano and sang with the UNT Jazz Singers. During this time, she had a chance meeting with future collaborator [[Jesse Harris]]. She gave a ride to a band playing at the university whose members happened to be friends of Harris. He was on a cross-country [[road trip]] with friend and future [[The Little Willies|Little Willies]] member Richard Julian, and stopped to see the band play. After meeting Jones, Harris started sending her [[lead sheet]]s of his songs.

In 1999, Jones left Texas for New York City. Less than a year later, she started a band with Harris, and her recordings with them were bestsellers.<ref>{{cite serial |access-date=January 4, 2009 |url=http://128.163.130.14/woodsongs-318.wmv |title=Jesse Harris & Jennifer Daniels |series=WoodSongs Old Time Radio Hour|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327131351/http://128.163.130.14/woodsongs-318.wmv |archive-date=March 27, 2009 }}</ref>

===2000–2002: ''New York City'', ''First Sessions'' and ''Come Away with Me''===
{{Main|New York City (The Peter Malick Group album)|First Sessions|Come Away with Me}}
As Peter Malick states in the liner notes, "I started looking for a singer who might be open to recording [my latest songs] for me.

After moving to New York City, Jones signed to [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]], a label owned by [[EMI Group]]. The signing came as an indirect result of her performing as lead singer for the JC Hopkins Biggish Band. Shell White, who was the wife of [[J. C. Hopkins]], worked for [[EMI Publishing]] and gave Jones's three-track demo to [[Bruce Lundvall]], the label's president, and Brian Bacchus, its artists and repertoire agent ([[artists and repertoire|A&R]]). The demo contained two jazz standards and a song by [[Jesse Harris]]. The two executives agreed that Jones had potential. Despite their misgivings about the direction of her music, they signed her to the label. Bacchus told ''[[HitQuarters]]'', "We let her find her own direction&nbsp;...

They announced their addition to the roster with an impromptu performance of "[[Rainy Day Women ♯12 & 35|Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]" from the Dylan album. In support of the album release, Secor states:

<blockquote>Fifty years is a long time for a place like Nashville, Tennessee. Time rolls on slowly around here like flotsam and jetsam in the muddy [[Cumberland River]].

"Look Away" is a "Rolling Stones-inspired tribute to the history of the American South," while "A World Away" is an "upbeat homage to refugees." "Dixie Avenue" is a wistful tribute to the place in Virginia where Secor and Fuqua first "fell in love with music." The closing song "Whirlwind" is a "bittersweet love song that could easily describe Old Crow Medicine's rise to prominence from the ground up."<ref name=":3" />

===Influences===

An early Secor influence was [[John Hartford]] who performed for his first grade class in [[Missouri]], making him want "to play the banjo after that;"<ref name=Premo group=i>{{cite news|last=Premo|first=Cole|title=Curiocity Interview: Ketch Secor Of 'Old Crow Medicine Show'|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/curiocity-interview-ketch-secor-of-old-crow-medicine-show/|access-date=13 November 2012|newspaper=CBS Minnesota|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> and the first song he ever learned to play was [[Tom Paxton]]'s "[[Ramblin' Boy]]".<ref name=Goodman />{{rp|6}} [[Guns N' Roses]] was Fuqua's "first influence": when they released ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), while he was in seventh grade, he knew he wanted to be a musician. He also claims AC/DC and Nirvana as influences "and then into blues and then into more obscure fiddlers.

Naming his major influences, Secor states: "Certainly, Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan. More than anything else. More than any book or song or story or play. The work and the recorded work of Bob Dylan. It's the most profound influence on me. And then the other people that really influenced me, tend to be the same people who influenced Bob Dylan."<ref name=Premo group=i/> Fuqua concurs on Dylan's influence:

{{blockquote|He's a link to Woody Guthrie, who's a link to an even earlier form of American music history. He's... a great doorway for all sorts of artists because he's not just folk or just rock ... I think bands like us, Mumford and Sons, and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are sort of doing what he has done before, in that we take our own experiences and observations and put them into songs made of traditional, American roots form. That form is still a great vehicle for songs, whether the song is about love, the Iraq War or anything else.<ref name=Dearmore group=i/>}}

The Dylan doorway led to the first recordings of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], the [[Jim Kweskin|Jim Kweskin Jug Band]], [[Canned Heat]], [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], Dylan and [[The Band]] in the basement, and the [[Grateful Dead]].<ref name=Mazor2004 />

===Impact===
{{quote box

|quote=While it would be going a bit far to say Old Crow sparked a full-blown folk revival, these guys have contributed mightily to a major shift in youthful attitudes toward ownership, authenticity and what it means to feel included in a musical experience: lyrics don't have to be strict autobiography to connect; songs don't have to be entirely original to showcase originality; and younger generations need not turn up their noses at music that doesn't treat them like they're at the center of the universe.<ref name="Hight" />|source= —Jewly Hight, [[American Songwriter]]}}

Early on the group didn't perform songs they'd written, instead drawing on a storehouse of pre-war [[jug band]], string band, [[minstrel show]], blues, and folk fare. As with other young groups in the genre, driven by all that punk music energy, they played this old material "fast and hard".<ref name=Himes>{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|title=That Old-Time Feeling: The new wave of string bands evolves|url=http://citypaper.com/music/that-old-time-feeling-1.1371425|access-date=13 September 2012|newspaper=Baltimore City Paper|date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> When they started writing original material they distinguished themselves "from the crowded field of New Wave string bands as genuine stars. And both groups have done it by writing new songs more ambitious than mere rewrites of old [[Hillbilly music|hillbilly]] and blues numbers."<ref name=Himes /> Songs they write often have a socially conscious theme, such as  "I Hear Them All", "Ways Of Man", "Ain't It Enough", and "Levi".

Secor admits to developing "the habit of writing what he calls 'stolen melody songs'"—in much the same way he'd created "Wagon Wheel", carrying on in the folk tradition—"like when he penned fresh, war tax-themed lyrics to a tune that had already passed through other wholesale re-writes during its descent from old-time [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[balladry]]."<ref name="Hight" /> Dave Rawlings states: "I've always thought that a really important thing that the Old Crow Medicine Show brought to the table was new songs—some reinterpreted old ones, some really nicely written and brand new—with the old flavor, but also with that vitality."<ref name=Mazor>{{cite news|last=Mazor|first=Barry|title=Renegades on the Road|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574320383262997704 |access-date=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>

==Biography==
Thorn was raised in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]].{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} Before his professional music career began, he was a professional boxer, where he established a respectable 14–4 record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I-S8pmpMjc|title=Episode #3: Paul Thorn - Former Pro Boxer and Musician|access-date=May 10, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Boxing career highlights include winning the Mid-South Middleweight Championship in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and culminated with a nationally televised bout with former world champion [[Roberto Durán]],<ref name="GAC1" /> After a few years of working in a Tupelo furniture factory and playing in local clubs, he was discovered by music professional [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] (brother of [[The Police (band)|The Police]] drummer [[Stewart Copeland]]).

In 1997, while performing at a singer-songwriters night at a local pizza shop (Vanelli's), Roger Sovine, representing [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], overheard Thorn and was impressed with his singing and songwriting ability. He asked Thorn if he had his permission to share his name with other record companies in Nashville. A couple weeks later, Thorn called vOz Vanelli (owner of Vanelli's) and mentioned that several record companies were coming to Tupelo to hear him perform. Thorn asked if he could come and play at Vanelli's which vOz agreed to. After hearing Thorn perform, Wyatt Easterling (an associate of [[Miles Copeland III]]) brought Thorn to Nashville and within thirty days, Thorn opened for [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. Thorn was subsequently signed to a recording contract with [[A&M Records]] and recorded his first album, ''Hammer & Nail,'' in 1997. He left A&M soon after and followed ''Hammer & Nail'' with thirteen more albums, all self-released and self-produced with his writing and production partner, Billy Maddox.

Thorn's 2010 album ''Pimps and Preachers'' debuted at No.&nbsp;83 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]], his highest chart position to date. His 2012 album ''What the Hell Is Going On'' was the 12th Most Played Album of 2012 on the Americana Music Association Year-End Chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2012/03/22/bernie-williams-ruthie-foster-susan-tedeschi-and-more-join-the-allman-brothers-band/ |title=Bernie Williams, Ruthie Foster, Susan Tedeschi and More Join The Allman Brothers Band |date=March 22, 2012 |access-date=January 30, 2013}}</ref> ''What the Hell Is Going On'' was Thorn's first album to feature the songwriting of other artists<ref name="Bio--Paul Thorn">{{cite web|title=Bio—Paul Thorn|url=http://www.paulthorn.com/bio/|website=Paulthorn.com|access-date=August 2, 2016}}</ref> and the second record of his to debut on the Billboard Top 100 during its first week of release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mississippilegends.com/articles/tupelo%E2%80%99s-paul-thorn/ |title=Tupelo's Paul Thorn |last=Corbett |first=Stephen |date=July 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=January 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216121828/http://mississippilegends.com/articles/tupelo%E2%80%99s-paul-thorn/ |archive-date=February 16, 2013}}</ref>

Thorn has toured as an opening act for [[Huey Lewis & the News]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[John Prine]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Robert Cray]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Toby Keith]] and [[Jeff Beck]].

In 2014, Thorn released ''Too Blessed to Be Stressed'', which he described as a collection of "positive anthem songs."<ref>from an interview on the [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode212 Americana Music Show #212], published September 25, 2014.</ref> "I wrote these songs hoping they might put people in a positive mindset and encourage them to count their own blessings, like I count mine," Thorn observes. "There's no higher goal I could set for myself than to help other people find some happiness and gratitude in their lives."<ref name="Bio--Paul Thorn"/>

In March 2018, Thorn released an album, titled ''Don't Let the Devil Ride'', featuring several covers of gospel songs that were inspiration to him during his youth and adolescence.<ref name="npr.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/17/594260751/paul-thorn-revisits-his-gospel-roots|title=Paul Thorn Revisits His Gospel Roots|website=NPR.org |access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref> The album features several prominent artists in that genre such as the [[Blind Boys of Alabama]], [[The McCrary Sisters]], [[Bonnie Bishop]], and the [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]].<ref name="npr.org"/> The album peaked at No. 1 in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Blues Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/blues-albums|title=Blues Music: Top Blues Albums Chart|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, Thorn's lead electric guitarist of 30 years, Bill Hinds, parted ways with the band. In a statement on Thorn's website, Hinds explains that he is starting a new chapter in his life, but will remain a musician.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paulthorn.com/blog/2019/5/15/a-farewell-from-guitarist-bill-hinds|date=May 15, 2019|title=A Farewell From Guitarist Bill Hinds|last=Hinds|first=Bill|website=Paulthorn.com}}</ref> Hinds spot in the Paul Thorn Band has been filled by Chris Simmons, a guitarist from Alabama, who played in [[Leon Russell]]'s band for five years.

During Aretha's childhood, her mother died. Her father could not keep her. Bailey, a man her father worked with, took her in. The Robinson family—Bailey, his wife Mary Jane, and his mother— informally adopted her and Aretha took the surname Robinson. A few years later Aretha became pregnant by Bailey. During the ensuing scandal, she left Greenville late in the summer of 1930 to be with family back in Albany. After the birth of the child, Ray Charles, she and the infant Charles returned to Greenville. Aretha and Bailey's wife, who had lost a son, then shared in Charles' upbringing. The father had left Greenville and married another woman elsewhere. By his first birthday, Charles had a brother, George.<ref name=Autobio/>

Charles was deeply devoted to his mother and later recalled, despite her poor health and adversity, her perseverance, self-sufficiency, and pride as guiding lights in his life.

In his early years, Charles showed an interest in mechanical objects and often watched his neighbors working on their cars and farm machinery. His musical curiosity was sparked at Wylie Pitman's Red Wing Cafe, at the age of three, when Pitman played [[boogie woogie]] on an old [[upright piano]]; Pitman subsequently taught Charles how to play the piano. Charles and his mother were always welcome at the Red Wing Cafe and even lived there when they were in financial distress.<ref name=Autobio/> Pitman also cared for Ray's younger brother George, to take some of the burden off their mother. George accidentally drowned in his mother's laundry tub when he was four years old.<ref name=Autobio/><ref name="SwingMusicBio">{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Jeff |title=Ray Charles Biography |url=http://www.swingmusic.net/Ray_Charles_Biography.html |website=Swingmusic.net |access-date=December 16, 2018 |archive-date=June 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614172253/http://www.swingmusic.net/Ray_Charles_Biography.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Charles further developed his musical talent at school<ref name= boheme/> and was taught to play the [[classical music|classical]] piano music of [[J.S. Bach|Bach]], [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]]. His teacher, Mrs. Lawrence, taught him how to use [[braille music]], a difficult process that requires learning the left hand movements by reading braille with the right hand and learning the right hand movements by reading braille with the left hand,  then combining the two parts.

Charles' mother died in the spring of 1945, when he was 14. Her death came as a shock to him; he later said the deaths of his brother and mother were "the two great tragedies" of his life. Charles decided not to return to school after the funeral.<ref name=Autobio/>

==Career==
===1945–1952: Florida, Los Angeles, and Seattle===
After leaving school, Charles moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to live with Charles Wayne Powell, who had been friends with his late mother.

In 1947, Charles moved to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], where he held two jobs, including one as a pianist for Charles Brantley's Honey Dippers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabaymusichistory.com/charlie-brantley-and-his-original-honey-dippers.php|title=Charlie Brantley and His Original Honey Dippers|publisher=Tampabaymusichistory.com|access-date=January 16, 2017|archive-date=October 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008090312/http://www.tampabaymusichistory.com/charlie-brantley-and-his-original-honey-dippers.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

In his early career, Charles modeled himself on [[Nat King Cole]].

Charles had always played piano for other people, but he was keen to have his own band. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, and, considering Chicago and New York City too big, followed his friend Gossie McKee to [[Seattle]], Washington, in March 1948, knowing that the biggest radio hits came from northern cities.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead"/><ref name="boheme2">{{cite news|title=Charles, Ray (1930–2004)|publisher=HistoryLink.org|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5707|access-date=May 12, 2007|archive-date=October 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031074822/http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5707|url-status=live}}</ref> There he met and befriended, under the tutelage of [[Robert Blackwell]], the 15-year-old [[Quincy Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon0bio-1|title=Quincy Jones Biography|publisher=Achievement.org|access-date=December 22, 2014  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926221424/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon0bio-1|archive-date=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

In 1950, Charles' performance in a Miami hotel impressed [[Henry Stone]], who went on to record a Ray Charles Rockin' record, which did not achieve popularity. During his stay in Miami, Charles was required to stay in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] but thriving black community of [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]]. Stone later helped [[Jerry Wexler]] find Charles in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Jacob|last=Katel|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2012-11-22/news/henry-stone-legendary-soul|title=Henry Stone: Legendary Soul|work=Miami New Times|date=November 22, 2012|access-date=February 14, 2013|archive-date=January 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110143845/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2012-11-22/news/henry-stone-legendary-soul/}}</ref>

After signing with [[Swing Time Records]], Charles recorded two more R&B hits under the name Ray Charles: "Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand" (1951), which reached No. 5, and "Kissa Me Baby" (1952), which reached No. 8. Swing Time folded the following year, and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] signed Charles to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]].<ref name=boheme/>

In addition to being a musician, Charles was also a record producer, producing [[Guitar Slim]]'s number 1 hit, "[[The Things That I Used to Do]]".

Late in 1954, Charles recorded "[[I've Got a Woman]]". The lyrics were written by bandleader Renald Richard. Charles claimed the composition. They later admitted that the song went back to [[the Southern Tones]]' "It Must Be Jesus" (1954). It became one of his most notable hits, reaching No. 2 on the R&B chart.<ref name=":0"/> "I've Got a Woman" combined [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz]], and [[blues]] elements. In 1955, he had hits with "[[This Little Girl of Mine]]" and "[[A Fool for You]]". In upcoming years, hits included "[[Drown in My Own Tears]]" and "[[Hallelujah I Love Her So]]".

Charles also recorded jazz, such as ''[[The Great Ray Charles]]'' (1957). He worked with vibraphonist [[Milt Jackson]], releasing ''[[Soul Brothers]]'' in 1958 and ''[[Soul Meeting]]'' in 1961. By 1958, he was not only headlining major black venues such as the [[The Apollo Theater|Apollo Theater]] in New York, but also larger venues such as [[Carnegie Hall]] and the [[The Newport Jazz Festival|Newport Jazz Festival]], where his first live album was recorded in 1958. He hired a female singing group, [[the Cookies]], and renamed them [[the Raelettes]]. In 1958, Charles and the Raelettes performed for the famed [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] concert produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]] held at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] on August 3. The other headliners were [[Little Willie John]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ernie Freeman]], and [[Bo Rhambo]].

Charles reached the pinnacle of his success at Atlantic with the release of "What'd I Say", which combined gospel, jazz, blues and Latin music. Charles said he wrote it spontaneously while he was performing in clubs with his band. Despite some radio stations banning the song because of its sexually suggestive lyrics, the song became Charles' first top-ten pop record. It reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' Pop chart and No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart in 1959.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":0"/> Later that year, he released his first country song (a cover of [[Hank Snow]]'s "[[I'm Moving On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]") and recorded three more albums for the label: a jazz record (''The Genius After Hours'', 1961); a blues record (''The Genius Sings the Blues'', 1961); and a big band record (''The Genius of Ray Charles'', 1959) which was his first Top 40 album, peaking at No. 17.

With "[[Georgia on My Mind]]", his first hit single for ABC-Paramount in 1960, Charles received national acclaim and four [[Grammy Award]]s, including two for "Georgia on My Mind" ([[Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male|Best Vocal Performance Single Record or Track, Male]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Song|Best Performance by a Pop Single Artist]]).

Charles earned another Grammy for the follow-up track "[[Hit the Road Jack]]", written by R&B singer [[Percy Mayfield]].

By late 1961, Charles had expanded his small road ensemble to a [[big band]], partly as a response to increasing royalties and touring fees, becoming one of the few black artists to cross over into mainstream pop with such a level of creative control.<ref name="times"/><ref name=cooper20>Cooper (1998), pp. 20–22.</ref> This success, however, came to a momentary halt during a concert tour in November 1961, when a police search of Charles' hotel room in Indianapolis, Indiana, led to the discovery of heroin in the medicine cabinet. The case was eventually dropped, as the search lacked a proper [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] by the police, and Charles soon returned to music.<ref name=cooper20/>

In the early 1960s, on the way from Louisiana to [[Oklahoma City]], Charles faced a near-death experience when the pilot of his plane lost visibility, as snow and his failure to use the defroster caused the windshield of the plane to become completely covered in ice. The pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane. Charles placed a spiritual interpretation on the experience, claiming that "something or someone which instruments cannot detect" was responsible for creating the small opening in the ice on the windshield which enabled the pilot to eventually land the plane safely.<ref name=Autobio/>

The 1962 album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv3-83.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=May 24, 2022|archive-date=August 9, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220809112847/https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv3-83.php|url-status=live}}</ref> and its sequel, ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music Volume Two|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2]]'', helped to bring [[country music]] into the musical mainstream. Charles' version of the [[Don Gibson]] song "[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]" topped the Pop chart for five weeks, stayed at No. 1 on the R&B chart for ten weeks, and gave him his only number-one record in the UK. In 1962, he founded his record label, [[Tangerine Records (1963)|Tangerine]], which ABC-Paramount promoted and distributed.<ref name=Autobio/>{{rp|248}} <ref name="Lydon Riverhead"/>{{rp|213–16}} He had major pop hits in 1963 with "[[Busted (Harlan Howard song)|Busted]]" (US No. 4) and "[[Take These Chains from My Heart]]" (US No. 8).<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Ray Charles Chart History|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/ray-charles/chart-history|magazine=Billboard|access-date=March 16, 2018|archive-date=August 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812130531/https://www.billboard.com/music/ray-charles/chart-history|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1964, [[Margie Hendrix]] was kicked out of the Raelettes after a big argument.

In 1964, Charles' career was halted once more after he was arrested for a third time for possession of heroin.<ref name=":8" /> He agreed to go to a rehabilitative facility to avoid jail time and eventually kicked his habit at a clinic in Los Angeles. After spending a year on parole, Charles reappeared in the charts in 1966 with a series of hits composed with [[Ashford & Simpson]] and [[Jo Armstead]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-brill-building-broadway-and-beyond-r-b-and-soul-singer-songwriter-joshie-armstead-2495380930.html|title=The Brill Building, Broadway, and Beyond: R&B and Soul Singer-songwriter Joshie Armstead|last=Wikane|first=Christian John|date=September 11, 2017|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020|archive-date=April 7, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407185601/https://www.popmatters.com/the-brill-building-broadway-and-beyond-r-b-and-soul-singer-songwriter-joshie-armstead-2495380930.html|url-status=live}}</ref> including the dance number "[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]" and "[[Let's Go Get Stoned]]", which became his first number-one R&B hit in several years. His cover version of "[[Crying Time]]", originally recorded by country singer [[Buck Owens]], reached No. 6 on the pop chart and helped Charles win a Grammy Award the following March. In 1967, he had a top-twenty hit with another ballad, "[[Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)|Here We Go Again]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pianofiles.com/browse/artist/ray+charles|title=Ray Charles Profile |publisher=PianoFiles.com |access-date=April 11, 2015  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504021948/http://www.pianofiles.com/browse/artist/ray+charles|archive-date=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

===1971–1983: Commercial decline===

Charles' renewed chart success, however, proved to be short lived, and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations. The rise of [[psychedelic rock]] and harder forms of rock and R&B music had reduced Charles' radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his master tapes had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: either adored or panned by fans and critics alike.<ref name="boheme"/> His recordings during this period, especially 1972's ''[[A Message from the People]]'', moved toward the [[progressive soul]] sound popular at the time.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Swenson|editor-first=John|year=1999|title=The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=978-0-679-76873-9|page=138}}</ref> ''A Message from the People'' included his unique gospel-influenced version of "[[America the Beautiful]]" and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of "America the Beautiful" because it was very drastically changed from the song's original version. On July 14, 1973, [[Margie Hendrix]], the mother of Ray's son Charles Wayne Hendrix, died at 38 years old, which led to Ray having to care for the child. The official cause of her death is unknown.

In 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit "[[Living for the City]]" later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album ''[[True to Life (Ray Charles album)|True to Life]]'', remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as [[Aretha Franklin]], were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|title=Ray Charles|publisher=SnlTranscripts.jt.org|date=November 12, 1977|access-date=September 10, 2010|archive-date=April 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406222235/https://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1979, his version of "Georgia on My Mind" was proclaimed the [[state song]] of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature. In 1980 Charles performed in the musical film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''.<ref name="boheme"/> Although he had notably supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort in South Africa in 1981 during an international boycott protesting that country's [[apartheid]] policy. He later defended his choice of performing there, insisting that the audience of black and white fans would integrate while he was there.<ref name="boheme"/>

===1983–2004: Later years===
In 1983, Charles signed a contract with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. He recorded a string of country albums and had hit singles in duets with singers such as [[George Jones]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[Mickey Gilley]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] ("Precious Thing") and his longtime friend [[Willie Nelson]], with whom he recorded "[[Seven Spanish Angels]]".

In 1985, Charles participated in the musical recording and video "[[We Are the World]]", a charity single recorded by the supergroup United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa.[[File:Ray Charles FIJM 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles at the 2003 [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], one of his last public performances]]

In 1990 he participated for the first time in the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] with song ''[[Good Love Gone Bad]]'', written by [[Toto Cutugno]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznHGPwwt9Q|title=Ray Charles - Good love gone bad (Gli amori - Toto Cutugno)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=November 7, 2022 |access-date=July 25, 2023|archive-date=July 25, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725153645/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznHGPwwt9Q|url-status=live}}</ref>

Before the release of his first album for Warner, ''Would You Believe'', Charles made a return to the R&B charts with a cover of the [[The Brothers Johnson|Brothers Johnson]]'s "[[I'll Be Good to You]]", a duet with his lifelong friend Quincy Jones and the singer [[Chaka Khan]], which hit number one on the R&B chart in 1990 and won Charles and Khan a Grammy for their duet. Prior to this, Charles returned to the pop charts with "[[Baby Grand]]", a duet with singer-songwriter [[Billy Joel]]. In 1989, he recorded a cover of the [[Southern All Stars]]' "Itoshi no Ellie" for a Japanese TV advertisement for the [[Suntory]] brand, releasing it in Japan as "Ellie My Love", where it reached No.{{nbsp}}3 on its [[Oricon]] chart.<ref name="oricon89">{{cite web|url=http://www2.wbs.ne.jp/~ms-db/oricon/oricon_single_89.htm |title=List of Best-Selling International Singles in Japan of 1989 |publisher=Oricon.

In 2001–02, Charles appeared in commercials for the [[New Jersey Lottery]] to promote its campaign "For every dream, there's a jackpot."

In 2003, he headlined the [[White House Correspondents' Association#White House Correspondents' dinner|White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] in Washington, D.C., attended by President [[George W. Bush]], [[Laura Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?176331-3/2003-white-house-correspondents-dinner-entertainment|title=2003 White House Correspondents' Dinner Entertainment|publisher=C-span.org|access-date=March 4, 2017|archive-date=September 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230908141349/https://www.c-span.org/video/?176331-3/2003-white-house-correspondents-dinner-entertainment|url-status=live}}</ref>

Also in 2003, Charles presented [[Van Morrison]] with Morrison's award upon being inducted in the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and the two sang Morrison's song "[[Crazy Love (Van Morrison song)|Crazy Love]]" (the performance appears on Morrison's 2007 album ''[[The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3]]''). In 2003, Charles performed "Georgia on My Mind" and "America the Beautiful" at a televised annual banquet of electronic media journalists held in Washington, D.C. His final public appearance was on April 30, 2004, at the dedication of his music studio as a historic landmark in Los Angeles.<ref name="boheme" />

==Legacy==
===Influence on music industry===
Charles possessed one of the most recognizable voices in American music. In the words of musicologist [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]]:

{{blockquote|Sinatra, and Bing Crosby before him, had been masters of words. Ray Charles is a master of sounds. His records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams and hollers, all wonderfully controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and rhythm... It is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can't tell it to you. He can't even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair—or exaltation. The voice alone, with little assistance from the text or the notated music, conveys the message.<ref>{{cite book|first= Henry|last= Pleasants|author-link= Henry Pleasants (music critic)|date= 1974|title= The Great American Popular Singers|publisher= Simon and Schuster|location= New York City|isbn= 978-0-671-21681-8|url= https://archive.org/details/greatamericanpop00pleas}}</ref>}}

Pleasants continues, "Ray Charles is usually described as a baritone, and his speaking voice would suggest as much, as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritone's high E and F in a popular ballad. But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even C sharp and D, sometimes in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in falsetto. In falsetto he continues up to E and F above high C. On one extraordinary record, 'I'm Going Down to the River'...he hits an incredible B flat...giving him an overall range, including the falsetto extension, of at least three octaves."

His style and success in the genres of rhythm and blues and jazz had an influence on a number of highly successful artists, including, as Jon Pareles has noted, [[Elvis Presley]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Van Morrison]], and [[Billy Joel]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/10/arts/music/ray-charles-who-reshaped-american-music-dies-at-73.html|title=Ray Charles, Who Reshaped American Music, Dies at 73|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 2004|access-date=September 23, 2018|archive-date=September 17, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230917012919/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/10/arts/music/ray-charles-who-reshaped-american-music-dies-at-73.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Other singers who have acknowledged Charles' influence on their own styles include [[James Booker]],<ref name="russell">{{cite book| first= Tony| last= Russell| date= 1997| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray| publisher=Carlton Books | location= Dubai| page= 94| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> [[Steve Winwood]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Buckley |first=Michael |url=https://www.stevewinwood.com/news/6062 |title=A Chat With Steve Winwood: June 10, 2005 |publisher=The Annapolis Capital |access-date=September 23, 2018 |archive-date=June 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230606052238/https://www.stevewinwood.com/news/6062 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Richard Manuel]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Viney |first=Peter |url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/viney_ray_charles_band.html |title=Influences on The Band: Ray Charles |publisher=theband.hiof.no |access-date=September 23, 2018 |archive-date=May 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220525151804/http://theband.hiof.no/articles/viney_ray_charles_band.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Gregg Allman]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynskey|first=John|url=https://www.greggallman.com/music/back-to-macon/|title=Gregg Allman Live: Back to Macon|date=December 5, 2016|publisher=greggallman.com|access-date=September 23, 2018|archive-date=September 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230915101925/https://greggallman.com/music/back-to-macon/|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Joe Levy, a music editor for ''Rolling Stone'', "The hit records he made for Atlantic in the mid-1950s mapped out everything that would happen to rock 'n' roll and soul music in the years that followed."<ref name="times" /> Charles was also an inspiration to [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]], who told the Turkish newspaper ''[[Hürriyet]]'': "I was about 15.

===Contribution to civil rights movement===
On March 15, 1961, shortly after the release of the hit song "Georgia on My Mind" (1960), the [[Albany, Georgia]]-born musician was scheduled to perform at a dance at Bell Auditorium in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], but cancelled the show after learning from students of [[Paine College]] that the larger auditorium dance floor was restricted to whites, while blacks would be obliged to sit in the Music Hall balcony. Charles left town immediately after letting the public know why he would not be performing, but the promoter went on to sue Charles for breach of contract, and Charles was fined $757 in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta on June 14, 1962. The following year, Charles did perform at a desegregated Bell Auditorium concert together with his backup singers, [[the Raelettes]], on October 23, 1963, as depicted in the 2004 film, ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]''.<ref>{{cite web|work=augustaciviccenter.com|url=http://augustaciviccenter.com/auditorium.html|title=William B.

==Personal life==
Charles stated in his 1978 autobiography, ''Brother Ray: Ray Charles' Own Story'', that he became hooked on women after losing his virginity at 12 years old to a woman about 20. "Cigarettes and smack [heroin] are the two truly addictive habits I've known. You might add women," he said. "My obsession centers on women—did then [when young] and does now. I can't leave them alone," he added.<ref name=":7">{{Cite magazine|date=November 30, 1978|title=Ray Charles' Own Book Reveals He|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr8DAAAAMBAJ&q=ray+charles&pg=PA24|magazine=Jet|volume=55|issue=11|pages=22–24, 60–62|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=May 8, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508045405/https://books.google.com/books?id=fr8DAAAAMBAJ&q=ray+charles&pg=PA24#v=snippet&q=ray%20charles&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Relationships and children===
Charles was married twice. His first marriage lasted less than a year; his second lasted 22 years. Throughout his life, Charles had many relationships with women with whom he fathered a dozen children.

His first marriage to Eileen Williams lasted from July 31, 1951, until 1952.

He met his second wife Della Beatrice Howard Robinson (called "Bea" by Charles) in Texas in 1954. They married the following year on April 5, 1955. Their first child together, Ray Charles Robinson Jr., was born in 1955. Charles was not in town for the birth because he was playing a show in Texas. The couple had two more sons, David and Robert. They raised their children in [[View Park–Windsor Hills, California|View Park, California]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Louie|date=October 1974|title=The Enduring Genius of Ray Charles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JN4DAAAAMBAJ&q=view+park&pg=PA125|journal=Ebony|page=125|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=May 8, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508045413/https://books.google.com/books?id=JN4DAAAAMBAJ&q=view+park&pg=PA125#v=snippet&q=view%20park&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> Charles felt that his heroin addiction took a toll on Della during their marriage.<ref name="Autobio" /> Due to his drug addiction, extramarital affairs on tours and volatile behavior, the marriage deteriorated and she filed for divorce in 1977 and it was finalized after 22 years of marriage.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswirl.com/della-beatrice-howard-robinson/|title=Della Beatrice Howard Robinson|date=December 30, 2017|website=NewSwirl|language=en-US|access-date=November 18, 2019|archive-date=June 26, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220626085007/https://www.newswirl.com/della-beatrice-howard-robinson/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Drug abuse and legal problems===
At 18, Charles first tried [[marijuana]] when he played in McSon Trio and was eager to try it as he thought it helped musicians create music and tap into their [[creativity]]. He later became addicted to [[heroin]] for seventeen years.<ref name=":7" /> Charles was first arrested in 1955, when he and his bandmates were caught backstage with loose marijuana and drug paraphernalia, including a burnt spoon, syringe, and needle. The arrest did not deter his drug use, which only escalated as he became more successful and made more money.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead" />

==Discography==
{{main|Ray Charles discography}}
Charles' discography is highly complex and extensive. [[AllMusic]] has listed approximately 60 original albums and more than 200 compilation albums, while music essayist [[Robert Christgau]] noted the existence of more. At least 20 record labels have released near-identical compilations of Charles' pre-[[Atlantic Records]] tracks, while many of the [[mastering (audio)|masters]] that Charles began to own after 1960 were not digitally reissued, leading the Atlantic sister label [[Rhino Entertainment]] to focus on rereleasing his mid-to-late 1950s music. Christgau has called Charles' discography a "monumental mess" and that "any map of his oeuvre must be personal and provisional".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=July 8, 2004|title=The Genius at Work: Ray Charles, A Critical Discography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=July 24, 2021|via=robertchristgau.com|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/charles-rs.php|archive-date=June 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613164806/https://robertchristgau.com/xg/music/charles-rs.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Musical career==
[[File:Rhiannon Giddens TFF 03.JPG|thumb|right|Giddens at [[Rudolstadt]] in 2015]]

Giddens is a 1995 alumna of the [[North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tomlinson |first=Tommy |date=2015-09-02 |title=Rhiannon Giddens & The Making of NC's Most Beautiful Voice |url=https://www.ourstate.com/rhiannon-giddens/ |access-date=2017-08-14 |website=Our State Celebrating North Carolina}}</ref> and a 2000 graduate of [[Oberlin Conservatory]] at [[Oberlin College]], where she studied opera.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Menconi |first=David |date=Spring 2011 |title=Creating Old-Time Music for the 21st Century |url=http://oberlin.edu/alummag/spring2011/features/oldtime.html |access-date=2013-01-21 |website=Oberlin Alumni Magazine |archive-date=2012-10-13  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013005053/http://oberlin.edu/alummag/spring2011/features/oldtime.html }}</ref>

In 2005, Giddens, who at that time was spending time participating in [[Scottish traditional music]] competitions (specializing in the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[lilting]] tradition, also known as mouth music),<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wosahla |first=Steve |date=2008-04-30 |title=Carolina Chocolate Drops – Digging back, driving forward |url=http://nodepression.com/article/carolina-chocolate-drops-digging-back-driving-forward |access-date=2017-04-02 |publisher=No Depression}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Sullivan |first=John Jeremiah |date=2019-05-13 |title=Rhiannon Giddens and What Folk Music Means |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/rhiannon-giddens-and-what-folk-music-means |magazine=New Yorker |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> attended the Black Banjo Then and Now Gathering, in [[Boone, North Carolina]]. There she met [[Dom Flemons]] and Súle Greg Wilson. The three started playing together professionally as  a "postmodern string band", Sankofa Strings.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Epstein |first=Jon |title=Sankofa Strings: &#124; Features &#124; Creative Loafing Charlotte |url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/sankofa-strings/Content?oid=2141147 |access-date=2017-04-02 |website=Clclt.com}}</ref> During that same time period, Giddens was also a regular caller at local [[contra dance]]s and featured in a Celtic music band called Gaelwynd. Later in 2005, after both Gaelwynd and Sankofa Strings had released CD albums, Giddens and Flemons teamed up with other musicians and expanded the Sankofa Strings sound into what was to become the Grammy winning [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]].

In 2007, Giddens contributed fiddle, banjo, "flat-footin'" dancing and additional vocals to [[Talitha MacKenzie]]'s album ''Indian Summer''.

Performing as a soprano, Giddens and mezzo-soprano Cheryse McLeod Lewis formed a duo called Eleganza to release a CD in 2009. ''Because I Knew You...'' consists of classical, religious, theater, and movie music. Giddens and Lewis were middle school classmates who reconnected after college while working in the same office. The friends started singing together in 2003, but did not begin recording until 2008.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pandolfi |first=Elizabeth |title=Classical duo Eleganza mixes it up musically |work=Charleston City Paper |url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/classical-duo-eleganza-mixes-it-up-musically/Content?oid=3612268 |access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref>

'''Robert Anthony Plant''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 20 August 1948) is an English singer and songwriter. He was the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] from its founding in 1968 until their breakup in 1980. Since then, he has had a successful solo career, sometimes collaborating with other artists such as [[Alison Krauss]]. Regarded by many as one of the greatest singers in rock music, he is known for his flamboyant persona and raw stage performances.

Plant was born and raised in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] area of England, where, after leaving [[grammar school]], he briefly trained as a chartered accountant before leaving home at 16 years old to concentrate on singing with a series of local blues bands, including [[Band of Joy]] with [[John Bonham]]. In 1968, he was invited by [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] and [[Jimmy Page]] to join [[The Yardbirds]], which Grant and Page were attempting to keep going after it had broken up (a breakup that became public knowledge by early July at the latest<ref>Rock, John J. ''Rolling Stone'' 6 July 1968</ref>). The new version of The Yardbirds changed their name to Led Zeppelin, and from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s, the band enjoyed considerable success.

Plant developed a compelling image as a charismatic rock-and-roll frontman, comparable to other '70s contemporaries such as [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[the Who]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]]. After Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant continued to perform and record continuously on a variety of solo and group projects. His first two solo albums, ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Principle of Moments]]'' (1983), each reached the top ten on the Billboard albums chart. With his band [[The Honeydrippers]] he scored a top-ten single hit with a remake of "[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]", which featured former Led Zeppelin bandmate Jimmy Page on guitar. Solo album ''[[Now and Zen]]'' (1988) was certified 3× Platinum and is Plant's biggest-selling solo album to date. In the 1990s, another reunion project called [[Page and Plant]] released two albums and earned a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 1998 for "[[Most High (song)|Most High]]". In 2007, Plant began a collaboration with bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, releasing the album ''[[Raising Sand]]'', which won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 2009 and produced the hit song "[[Please Read the Letter]]", which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] the same year. In 2010, he revived the [[Band of Joy]] (which shared its name with an early band he performed with in the 1960s), and in 2012 formed a new band, the Sensational Space Shifters, followed by a reunion with Alison Krauss in 2019.

In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=Hall/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Plant as one of the 100 best singers of all time (2008);<ref name="ROLLS">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/robert-plant-20101202 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time: Robert Plant] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

==Early life and musical beginnings==
Robert Anthony Plant was born on 20 August 1948, in the [[Black Country]] town of [[West Bromwich]], Staffordshire<!--Pre-1974-->, England, to Robert C.

There was a certain ambience between the curtains and the French windows, there was a certain sound there for a ten-year-old. which was all the ambience I got at ten years old ... And I always wanted to be ... a bit similar to that.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/Jimmy-Page-Robert-Plant/Songs/Interview-210508 |website=laut.de |language=de |trans-title=Interview by Jimmy Page Robert Plant |title=Interview von Jimmy Page Robert Plant|access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref></blockquote>He left [[King Edward VI College, Stourbridge|King Edward VI Grammar School for Boys]] in [[Stourbridge]] in his mid-teens and developed a strong passion for the [[blues]], mainly through his admiration for [[Willie Dixon]], [[Robert Johnson]] and early renditions of songs in this genre.

He abandoned training as a chartered accountant after only two weeks to attend college in an effort to gain more [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] passes and to become part of the [[Midlands|English Midlands]] blues scene.<ref>''Led Zeppelin in Their Own Words'' compiled by Paul Kendall (1981), London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-86001-932-2}}, p. 14.</ref><ref>Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-7119-5307-4}}, p. 10.</ref> "I left home at 16," he said, "and I started my real education musically, moving from group to group, furthering my knowledge of the blues and of other music which had weight and was worth listening to."<ref>Fortnam, Ian (2008). "Dazed & Confused", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', p. 38.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}</ref>

Plant's early blues influences included Johnson, [[Bukka White]], [[Skip James]], [[Jerry Miller]], and [[Sleepy John Estes]]. Plant had various jobs while pursuing his music career, one of which was working for the major British construction company [[George Wimpey|Wimpey]] in Birmingham in 1967, laying tarmac on roads. He also worked at [[Woolworths Group (United Kingdom)|Woolworth's]] in [[Halesowen]] town for a short period of time. He cut three obscure singles on [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]]<ref>''Hammer of the Gods'', by Stephen Davis {{ISBN|1-57297-306-4}} (p.48-49)</ref> and sang with a variety of bands, including the Crawling King Snakes, which brought him into contact with drummer [[John Bonham]]. They both went on to play in the [[Band of Joy]], merging blues with newer psychedelic trends.

In 1968, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] was in search of a lead singer for his new band and met Plant after being turned down by his first choice, [[Terry Reid]], who referred him to a show at a teacher training college in [[Birmingham]] (where Plant was singing in a band named Hobbstweedle).<ref name=RS2006>{{cite magazine | author = Gilmore, Mikal | date = 10 August 2006 | title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | issue=1006 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-long-shadow-of-led-zeppelin-20060810 | access-date=16 June 2016 }}</ref> In front of Page, Plant sang [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]", leading Page to end his search.<ref name=RS2006/> As recalled by Plant and Page:
{{blockquote|Plant:  I was appearing at this college when <nowiki>[</nowiki>manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and Jimmy turned up and asked me if I'd like to join [[the Yardbirds]]. I knew the Yardbirds had done a lot of work in America&nbsp;– which to me meant audiences who would want to know what I might have to offer&nbsp;– so naturally I was very interested.<ref>Fortnam, Ian (2008). "Dazed & Confused", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', p. 39.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}</ref>}}

{{blockquote|Page:  When I auditioned him and heard him sing, I immediately thought there must be something wrong with him personality-wise or that he had to be impossible to work with, because I just could not understand why, after he told me he'd been singing for a few years already, he hadn't become a big name yet. So I had him down to my place for a little while, just to sort of check him out, and we got along great. No problems.<ref>Schulps, Dave (October 1977).

With a shared passion for music, Plant and Page immediately developed a strong relationship, and began their writing collaboration with reworkings of earlier blues songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Initially dubbed the "New Yardbirds" in 1968, the band soon came to be known as [[Led Zeppelin]]. The band's [[Eponym#Other eponyms|eponymous]] [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]] hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre. Plant has commented that it is unfair for people to think of Zeppelin as heavy metal, as almost a third of their music was acoustic.<ref>''The History of Rock 'n' Roll: The '70s: Have a Nice Decade''.{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In July 1977, his son Karac died at the age of five while Plant was on Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of the United States]].

===Lyrics===
[[File:Robert-Plant.jpg|thumb|Plant with Led Zeppelin, 1973]]

Plant began writing song lyrics with Led Zeppelin during the making of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', in 1969. According to Jimmy Page:

{{blockquote|The most important thing about ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' is that up to that point I'd contributed lyrics. Robert hadn't written before, and it took a lot of ribbing to get him into writing, which was funny. And then, on the second LP, he wrote the words of Thank You. He said, "I'd like to have a crack at this and write it for my wife."<ref>Kent, Nick. "Led Zeppelin: Eyewitness." '' Mojo Magazine: Classic Rock Special Issue'' (2009, Volume 2, 1ssue 6), p. 104.</ref>}}

Plant's lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical, philosophical and spiritual, alluding to events in classical and [[Norse mythology]], such as "[[Immigrant Song]]", which refers to [[Valhalla]] and [[Viking]] conquests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/ffcpop/led_zeppelin/0 |title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} The Faber Companion to 20th Century Popular Music – Credo Reference |website=search.credoreference.com |access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> However, the song "[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]" is often misunderstood to refer to the god [[Thor]]; the song actually refers to [[Mount Thor]] (which is named after the god). Another example is "[[The Rain Song]]".{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Plant was influenced by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],<ref>Robert Plant himself, in ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', May 1993, page 18, stated, "The self-indulgence, the silly over-the-top Tolkien-esque stuff ... [[John Bonham|John]] made it everlasting.".</ref><ref>Helen Armstrong (1993), 'The Singer, not the Song', in ''Amon Hen'' (the bulletin of [[The Tolkien Society]], U.K.), no. 123 p..4-5.</ref> whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs. Most notably, "[[The Battle of Evermore]]", "[[Misty Mountain Hop]]", "[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]", "[[Ramble On]]" and "[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]" contain verses referencing Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=":0" /> Conversely, Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues themes dealing with sex, as in "[[The Lemon Song]]", "[[Trampled Under Foot]]" about giving in to sexual temptation,<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Robert |last= Godwin |author-link= Robert Godwin |title= Led Zeppelin: Alchemists of the '70s |magazine= [[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]] |date= 24 August 1990 |page= 13}}</ref> and "[[Black Dog (Led Zeppelin song)|Black Dog]]" narrated by a man obsessed with a woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=Led Zeppelin, All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers |location=New York |first1=Jean-Michael |last1=Guesdon |first2=Philippe |last2=Margotin |year=2018 |chapter=Ch.

[[Welsh mythology]] forms a basis of Plant's interest in mystical lyrics. He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to [[Snowdonia]]. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as [[Black Book of Carmarthen]], [[Book of Taliesin]], etc.) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior [[Caratacus]]. The song "[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]" is named after the 18th-century Welsh cottage [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song "[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]".<ref name=":0">{{cite book |title=The Life and Times of Led Zeppelin |last=Morris |first=Robin |publisher=Assegai Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=9781620957936 |location=Jeffreys Bay, South Africa |pages=50}}</ref> The songs "Misty Mountain Hop", "[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]", and early dabblings in what would become "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).<ref>"Stairway to Heaven, Paved with Gold: Led Zeppelin's Snowdonia", ''The Independent'', 6 April 1991.</ref>

Page's passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco, where he encountered [[Umm Kulthum]]:

{{blockquote|I was intrigued by the scales, initially, and obviously the vocal work. The way she sang, the way she could hold a note, you could feel the tension, you could tell that everybody, the whole orchestra, would hold a note until she wanted to change.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/robert-plant-i-feel-so-far-away-from-heavy-rock-2063017.html |title=Robert Plant: 'I feel so far away from heavy rock' |work=The Independent |location=UK |access-date=30 August 2010 |date=27 August 2010 |author=Andy Gill}}</ref>}}

Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/robert-plant-12103147 |title=Robert Plant |website=Biography |access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> During his solo career Plant tapped into these influences many times, most notably on the 2002 album ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''.

Most of the lyrics of "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" from ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at [[Headley Grange]] while the track was being recorded. While never released as a single, the song has topped polls as the greatest song of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309135735/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 March 2005 |title=Rockers still climbing 'Stairway to heaven' |date=25 December 2004|website=ABC News Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref>

===Stage persona===
[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|thumb|Plant (left) with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page in concert in Chicago, Illinois, 1977]]

Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries [[the Who]]'s singer [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Mick Jagger]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]].<ref name=theirtime>"Their Time is Gonna Come", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008.</ref> With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the "god of rock and roll" or "rock god" archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.

According to ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, "once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, "Percy" Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal."<ref>Fortnam, Ian (2008). "Dazed & Confused", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', p. 43.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}</ref> In 1994, during his "Unledded" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:

{{blockquote|I can't take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously. It's not some great work of beauty and love to be a [[rock-and-roll]] singer.

One of the oddest awards he received was the ''Rock Scene'' magazine "Chest O Rama". Readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock, and Plant was the winner. When they contacted him about it, he replied: "I'm really greatly honoured although it's hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chest."<ref>''Rock Scene'', June 1974, Four Seasons Publications, Inc. 59287-4</ref>

==Solo career (1981–present)==

===Early career and success (1981–1993)===
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2023}}
After Led Zeppelin disbanded in December 1980 (following the death of drummer [[John Bonham]]), Plant briefly considered abandoning music to pursue a career as a teacher in the [[Waldorf education|Rudolf Steiner education system]], going so far as to be accepted for teacher training. He nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career, helped by encouragement from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer [[Phil Collins]], who would go on to play with him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/23372/20150106/robert-plant-praises-phil-collins-encouraging-solo-career-led-zeppelin-split.htm |title=Robert Plant Praises Phil Collins For Encouraging His Solo Career After Led Zeppelin's Split |work=Music Times |first=Shawn |last=Christ |date=6 January 2015 |access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Plant's solo career began with the album ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' in 1982, followed by 1983's ''[[The Principle of Moments]]''. Popular tracks from this period include "[[Big Log]]" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), "[[In the Mood (Robert Plant song)|In the Mood]]" (1983), "[[Little by Little (Robert Plant song)|Little by Little]]" (from 1985's ''[[Shaken 'n' Stirred]]''), "Far Post" (the B-side of "[[Burning Down One Side]]"), which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 movie ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' starring [[Gregory Hines]] and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], and popularised by airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] stations), "[[Tall Cool One (Robert Plant song)|Tall Cool One]]" (a No. 25 hit from 1988's ''[[Now and Zen]]'') and later "[[I Believe (Robert Plant song)|I Believe]]" (from 1993's ''[[Fate of Nations]]''). This last track, like Led Zeppelin's "[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]", was written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac. Whilst Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (although he would occasionally improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with Phil Collins on drums) and in 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues. In 1986 Plant performed at the [[Heart Beat 86|Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert]] with other famous Midlands musicians.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter [[Phil Johnstone]]. These were: ''[[Now and Zen]]'' in 1988, ''[[Manic Nirvana]]'' in 1990, and the 1993 ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' (which features [[Moya Brennan]] of [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and former [[Cutting Crew]] guitarist [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Scott MacMichael]]). Songs from this third album, plus a smattering of Led Zeppelin classics, made up the set-list for Plant's acclaimed sunset performance on the Main Stage at Glastonbury Festival, in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 1993|url = http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1993/|website = Glastonbury Festival – 24–28 June 2015|access-date = 12 February 2016|first = Pretty Good|last = Digital}}</ref> It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had always previously resisted, not wanting to be forever known as "the former Led Zeppelin vocalist".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Although Led Zeppelin disbanded in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]]. They released an EP called ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the [[Phil Phillips]]' tune "[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s "[[Rockin' at Midnight]]". The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', and in the same year Page contributed to Plant's album ''Now and Zen''. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin, at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert (where he also performed in his own right as a solo artist). Plant's live collaborations with other well-known musicians continued when he took to the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium, for 1992's "The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert" for AIDS Awareness; where he sang Queen's "[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]" and "[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]", and Led Zeppelin's "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" and "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]".

===Page and Plant (1994–1998)===
[[Page and Plant]] became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995, including a return to the Glastonbury Festival.<ref name="Lewis 2010 p. 553">{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=D. | title=Led Zeppelin: The 'Tight But Loose' Files | publisher=Music Sales | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-85712-220-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOzTNQk0C48C&pg=PT553 | access-date=19 August 2023 | page=553}}</ref> Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce ''No Quarter''. Having long resisted offers from MTV to reform to do an ''Unplugged'' show, they finally accepted as part of a deal that also allowed them to visit Morocco to record new material. The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star Najma Akhtar.

Page and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material as the 1998 album ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career after another world tour. A song from this album, "[[Please Read the Letter]]", was re-recorded by Plant with [[Alison Krauss]], and was featured on their 2007 album which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]].

=== Priory of Brion and reunion with Page (1999–2001) ===
Starting in mid-1999, Plant performed until the end of 2000 at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion. This band consisted of the original Band of Joy guitarist Kevyn Gammond alongside [[Andy Edwards (musician)|Andy Edwards]] (drums), Paul Timothy (keyboards), and Paul Wetton (bass). The Priory of Brion played around one hundred concerts across Europe at various small clubs and festivals. The band performed cover versions of songs that had influenced Plant in his formative years. Many of these cover versions would crop up later on his [[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|''Dreamland'']] album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Priory of Brion |website=www.robertplanthomepage.com |url=http://www.robertplanthomepage.com/priory_of_brion/_private/priory_of_brion.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213001821/http://www.robertplanthomepage.com/priory_of_brion/_private/priory_of_brion.htm|archive-date=13 February 2017|access-date=4 December 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1999, Plant contributed to the [[tribute album]] for [[Moby Grape]] co-founder [[Skip Spence]], who was terminally ill. The album, ''[[More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album]]'' ([[Birdman Records|Birdman]], 1999), with the album title referring to Spence's only solo album, ''[[Oar (Skip Spence album)|Oar]]'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]], 1969), contained Plant's version of Spence's "Little Hands". Plant had been an admirer of Spence and Moby Grape since the release of Moby Grape's [[:wikt:eponym|eponymous]] 1967 [[Moby Grape (album)|debut album]].{{efn|1=Plant included "8:05", from the first Moby Grape album, as a B-side to a 1993 single; it is also included on the expanded reissue of his ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' album on [[Rhino Records]]. Plant performed "Hey Grandma" (also from the first Moby Grape album) live when with his pre-Led Zeppelin [[Band of Joy]], during the 1967–1968 period.<ref name=raresongs>{{cite web |website=Robert Plant Now and Zen |title=Rare and Unrecorded Songs |url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~liden/rp_raresongs.html |access-date=21 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111014408/http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~liden/rp_raresongs.html |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Robert Plant albums reborn with nine lives |url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=448 |website=New Releases |publisher=Rhino Records |date=20 September 2006 |access-date=22 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015223620/http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=448 |archive-date=15 October 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On the ''[[Sixty Six to Timbuktu]]'' collection (2003), Plant includes his version of Spence's "Little Hands", as well as "Naked If I Want To", another song from the first Moby Grape album.<ref name=raresongs/>}}

In 2001, Plant appeared on [[Afro Celt Sound System]]'s album ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]''. The song "Life Begin Again" features a duet with Welsh folksinger [[Julie Murphy (singer)|Julie Murphy]], emphasising Plant's recurring interest in Welsh culture (Murphy would also tour in support of Plant).

In the summer of 2001, Plant reunited with Page for both a cover of "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It" for a Sun Records tribute album and an appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, the last time they worked outside of Led Zeppelin together.<ref name=":4" />

===Strange Sensation and further collaborations (2002–2009)===
In 2002, with his then newly formed band Strange Sensation, Plant released a widely acclaimed collection of mostly blues and folk remakes, ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''. Contrasting with this lush collection of often relatively obscure remakes, the second album with Strange Sensation, ''[[Mighty ReArranger]]'' (2005), contains new, original songs. Both have received some of the most favourable reviews of Plant's solo career and four [[Grammy]] nominations, two in 2003 and two in 2006.

[[File:Robert Plant.jpg|thumb|left|Plant and Strange Sensation at the Green Man Festival, 2007]]

As a former member of Led Zeppelin, along with Page and John Paul Jones, Plant received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2005 and the Polar Music Prize in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Robert Plant and Alison Krauss |url=http://www.rounder.com/artists/robert-plant-and-alison-krauss |website=Rounder |access-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911161103/http://www.rounder.com/artists/robert-plant-and-alison-krauss |archive-date=11 September 2012 |date=11 September 2012}}</ref>

From 2001 to 2007, Plant actively toured the US and Europe with Strange Sensation. His sets typically included recent, but not only, solo material and plenty of Led Zeppelin favourites, often with new and expanded arrangements. A DVD titled ''Soundstage: Robert Plant and Strange Sensation'', featuring his ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]'' performance (filmed at the Soundstage studios in Chicago on 16 September 2005), was released in October 2006.

With Strange Sensation's Justin Adams he appeared at the 2003 ''[[Festival au Desert]]'' held in [[Essakane]] in the [[North of Mali]],<ref name="Festival Au Desert">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-au-desert.org/index.cfm?m=0&s=2|title='Caravanes des Artistes pour la Paix' du Festival au Désert history|date=February 2013|work=Festival Au Desert|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> captured in a French-language documentary film entitled ''Le Festival au Désert'' (2004).

On 23 June 2006, Plant was the headliner (backed by [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]]'s band) at the Benefit For [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]] concert at New York's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], a show which raised money for Lee's medical expenses from his bout with leukaemia. Plant and band performed thirteen songs&nbsp;– five by Arthur Lee & Love, five Led Zeppelin songs and three others, including a duet with Ian Hunter. At the show, Plant told the audience of his great admiration for Arthur Lee dating back to the mid-'60s. Lee died of his illness six weeks after the concert.

An expansive box set of his solo work, ''[[Nine Lives (Robert Plant album)|Nine Lives]]'', was released in November 2006, which expanded all of his albums with various B-sides, demos, and live cuts. It was accompanied by a DVD. All his solo works were re-released with these extra tracks individually.

In 2007, Plant contributed two tracks to the [[Fats Domino]] tribute album ''[[Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino]]'', "It Keeps Rainin{{'"}} with the Lil' Band o' Gold and "[[Valley of Tears (song)|Valley of Tears]]" with the [[Soweto Gospel Choir]].

Plant performed with Strange Sensation guitarist [[Justin Adams]] and the West African riti (a one-string violin) master [[Juldeh Camara]] for the finale of the three day [[World of Music, Arts and Dance]] Festival in [[Abu Dhabi]]. Approximately 50,000 attended each of the free Womad concerts, which took place on the Corniche public beach from 23–25 April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/robert-plant-wows-womad-1.523005|title=Robert Plant wows Womad|date=25 April 2009|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|access-date=28 January 2022}}</ref>

In 2007 and 2008, Plant recorded and performed with bluegrass star [[Alison Krauss]]. A [[duet]] album, ''[[Raising Sand]]'', was released on 23 October 2007 on Rounder Records. The album, recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and produced by [[T Bone Burnett]], includes performances of lesser-known material from [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[Country music|country]] songwriters including [[Mel Tillis]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Little Milton]] and [[the Everly Brothers]]. In February 2008 the song "[[Gone Gone Gone (Done Moved On)]]" from ''Raising Sand'' won a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards|50th Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Grammy winners|website=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/10/grammy.winners/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205174232/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/10/grammy.winners/index.html|archive-date=5 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=28 November 2017|title=50th Annual GRAMMY Awards |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/50th-annual-grammy-awards-2007|access-date=30 November 2021|website=GRAMMY.com}}</ref> In February 2009 at the [[51st Grammy Awards]], ''Raising Sand'' won 5 Grammys, for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, and Contemporary Folk/Americana Album.<ref>{{cite web |last=Glaister |first=Dan |date=9 February 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/09/grammy-awards-robert-plant |title=Veteran Robert Plant steals show at Grammys |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]] |access-date=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=28 November 2017|title=51st Annual GRAMMY Awards|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/51st-annual-grammy-awards-2008|access-date=30 November 2021 |website=GRAMMY.com}}</ref> The album has been successful critically and commercially, and was certified platinum on 4 March 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|date=4 March 2008|title=Gold & Platinum: Raising Sand |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|website=RIAA|access-date=30 November 2021}}</ref> The album was also nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]] in July 2008.<ref>{{cite web|author=Owen Gibson, media correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/23/mercuryprize.popandrock |title=Mercury picks dark horses and rising stars |date=23 July 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref>

Plant and Krauss began an extended tour of the US and Europe in April 2008, playing music from ''Raising Sand'' and other American roots music as well as reworked Led Zeppelin tunes. Also in 2008, Plant performed with bluegrass musicians at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] and [[Bonnaroo]] Music & Arts Festival. He appeared as a surprise guest during [[Fairport Convention]]'s set at the 2008 [[Fairport's Cropredy Convention|Cropredy Festival]], performing Led Zeppelin's "[[The Battle of Evermore]]" with Kristina Donahue as a tribute to [[Sandy Denny]].

==Led Zeppelin-related projects and reunion rumours==
[[File:Led Zeppelin by p a h (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Plant on stage with [[Jimmy Page]] in 2007]]

Plant performed with living members of Led Zeppelin both on 13 July 1985 for [[Live Aid]] (with [[Phil Collins]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] on drums) and on 15 May 1988 for [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]]. At the 1988 reunion, [[Jason Bonham]], the son of Led Zeppelin's late drummer [[John Bonham]], played drums. Both sets featured only a few songs, performed with minimal rehearsal. Plant was unhappy with both performances, saying that "it was like sleeping with your ex-wife but not making love." At the 1990 [[Silver Clef Award]] Winners Concert at [[Knebworth Festival|Knebworth]], Plant was joined by Jimmy Page. Some of their set was released on the subsequent live album and video. In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]];<ref name=Hall>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/led-zeppelin|work=rockhall.com|title=Led Zeppelin}}</ref> Plant performed a medley of blues numbers at the induction show with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Jason Bonham, [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], then they were joined by fellow inductee [[Neil Young]] for "[[When the Levee Breaks]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rock-roll-hall-of-fame-95-74694/|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame '95|author=[[Jancee Dunn]]|date=23 February 1995}}</ref>

After years of reunion rumours, Led Zeppelin performed a full two-hour set on 10 December 2007 at the [[Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert]], with [[Jason Bonham|Jason]] again filling in on drums. Despite enormous public demand, Plant declined a $200&nbsp;million offer to tour with Led Zeppelin after the 2007 show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justpressplay.net/music/music-news/3001-robert-plan-turns-down-200-million-for-led-zep-reunion-tour.html |date=2 March 2008 |title=Robert Plant Turns Down $200 million for Zeppelin Reunion Tour |website=Just Press Play |access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref> In interviews following the 2007 show, Plant left the door open to possible future performances with Led Zeppelin, saying that he enjoyed the reunion and felt that the show was strong musically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/led_zeppelin/news/11294 |title=Robert Plant Confirms 'Led Zeppelin Could Play Again' |website=Uncut |access-date=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205200642/http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/led_zeppelin/news/11294 |archive-date=5 December 2011 }}</ref> Although Page and Jones have expressed the strong desire to tour as Led Zeppelin,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Gregory |date=13 June 2008 |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/43840/jason-bonham-i-would-do-a-led-zeppelin-tour-in-a-heartbeat |title=Jason Bonham: 'I Would Do a Led Zeppelin Tour in a Heartbeat' |website=Gigwise |access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref> Plant has consistently opposed a full tour and has responded negatively to questions about another reunion. In a January 2008 interview, he stated that he does not want to "tour like a bunch of bored old men following the Rolling Stones around." In a statement on his web site in late 2008, Plant stated, "I will not be touring with Led Zeppelin or anyone else for the next two years. Anyone buying Led Zeppelin tickets will be buying bogus tickets."

In February 2013, Plant hinted that he was open to a Led Zeppelin reunion in 2014, though suggesting that he was not the reason for Led Zeppelin's dormancy, saying that Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones "are Capricorns...They're quite contained in their own worlds and they leave it to me", adding that he was "not the bad guy" and that "You need to see the Capricorns – I've got nothing to do in 2014".<ref>{{cite web |author=Rolling Stone |url=http://entertainment.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17019003-robert-plant-hints-hed-be-open-to-a-led-zeppelin-reunion?lite |title=Robert Plant hints he'd be open to a Led Zeppelin reunion |website=NBC News Entertainment |date=19 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221042359/http://entertainment.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17019003-robert-plant-hints-hed-be-open-to-a-led-zeppelin-reunion?lite |access-date=16 March 2013|archive-date=21 February 2013 }}</ref>

In a spring 2014 interview with the [[BBC]] about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin's first three albums, Page said he was sure fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that "the chances of it happening [were] zero". Page then told ''The New York Times'' that he was "fed up" with Plant's refusal to play, stating: "I was told last year that Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, to be honest with you. I don't sing, so I can't do much about it", adding: "I definitely want to play live. Because, you know, I've still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So, yeah, I'll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/led-zeppelin/77386 |title=Jimmy Page is 'fed up' with Plant delaying Led Zeppelin reunion plans |date= 19 May 2014 <!-- 11:37  --> |website=[[NME]] |access-date=22 August 2014}}</ref>

On 30 July 2014, [[NME]] revealed that Plant was "slightly disappointed and baffled" by Page in an ongoing Led Zeppelin dispute during which Page declared he was "fed up" with Plant delaying Led Zeppelin reunion plans. Instead, Plant offered Led Zeppelin's guitarist to write acoustically with him as he is interested in working with Page again but only in an unplugged way.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/led-zeppelin/78865 |title=Robert Plant says he is 'disappointed and baffled' by Jimmy Page in ongoing Led Zeppelin dispute |date= 30 July 2014 <!-- 12:09  --> |website=[[NME]] |access-date=22 August 2014}}</ref> Page responded:

Plant is interested in Welsh history and donated money to the creation of a bronze statue of the Welsh prince [[Owain Glyndŵr]], at [[Pennal Church]], near [[Machynlleth]], in Wales, unveiled in September 2004. He is also believed to have contributed funds to a slate carving of Glyndŵr's coat of arms at the [[Celtica museum]] in Machynlleth.

In a July 2012 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, Plant stated he "eloped and ran off to Texas" with American singer [[Patty Griffin]]. Plant's UK-based manager later told ''[[E! News]]'' that Plant was apparently being cheeky when he used the word "eloped" to describe his home life, for "Robert has not married Patty Griffin," instead "He was just referring to the fact that he's been residing in Texas" with her. According to a July 2012 ''[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]'' article, Plant and Griffin had been dating for over a year, spending half of their time together in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Tim Cumming |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/man-with-a-whole-lotta-talent-7932558.html |title=Man with a whole lotta talent&nbsp;– Features |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 July 2012 |access-date=16 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Josh Grossberg |url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/330553/robert-plant-elopes-with-singer-songwriter-patty-griffin |title=Robert Plant "Elopes" With Singer-Songwriter Patty Griffin |publisher=E!

The "high lonesome sound" term is now used to describe [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] singing, although Holcomb was not, strictly speaking, a bluegrass performer.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

==Performance style==
Holcomb's repertoire included [[old-time music]], [[hymns]], [[traditional music]] and [[blues]] ballads. In addition to playing the banjo and guitar, he was a competent [[harmonica]] and [[fiddle]] player, and sang many of his most memorable songs [[a cappella]]. Holcomb stated: "Up till then the blues were only inside me; [[Blind Lemon]] was the first to 'let out' the blues."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/116 116]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/116}}</ref>

Holcomb sang in a nasal style informed by the [[Old Regular Baptist]] vocal tradition. [[Bob Dylan]], a fan of Holcomb, described his singing as possessing "an untamed sense of control".<ref name="AllMusic_Untamed">{{AllMusic|album|mw0000019275|''An Untamed Sense of Control''}}</ref> He was also admired by the [[Stanley Brothers]] and [[Eric Clapton]], who cited Holcomb as his favorite country musician.<ref name="AllMusic_Untamed" />

Holcomb gave his last live performance in 1978. Due to what he described as injuries he sustained during his long career as a laborer, Holcomb was eventually unable to work for more than short periods, and his later income came primarily from his music. Suffering from asthma and [[emphysema]] as a result of working in coal mines, he died in a nursing home in 1981, at the age of 68.<ref name="cohen2">{{cite book|author=John Cohen|title=The High & Lonesome Sound: The Legacy of Roscoe Holcomb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KpPYgEACAAJ|year=2012|publisher=Steidl|isbn=978-3-86930-254-6}}</ref>

He has played with [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Ali Farka Touré]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Neil Young]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt]], [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[the Chieftains]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Manuel Galbán]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Little Feat]], and [[Carla Olson|Carla Olson and the Textones]] (on record and film). He formed the band [[Little Village]], and produced the album ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1997), which became a worldwide hit; [[Wim Wenders]] directed the [[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|documentary film of the same name]] (1999), which was nominated for an Academy Award in 2000.

Cooder was ranked at No. 8 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's 2003 list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time",<ref name="RS100">{{cite magazine|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231 |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time|magazine=Rolling Stone|date= September 18, 2003|access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref> while a 2010 list by [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] placed him at No. 32.<ref>{{cite web | title=Gibson.com Reveals Top 50 Guitarists, Plus Readers Poll Results | url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/gibson-reveals-0528/ | publisher=Gibson Guitar Corporation | date=May 28, 2010 | access-date=June 3, 2010 |url-status = dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601042203/http://www.gibson.com/en%2Dus/Lifestyle/Features/gibson%2Dreveals%2D0528/ | archive-date=June 1, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2011, he published a collection of short stories called ''[[Los Angeles Stories]]''.

==Career==
=== 1960s ===
Cooder performed as part of a [[pickup group|pickup trio]] with [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Doc Watson]], in which he played [[banjo]]. The trio was not successful, but reflecting his early exposure to the instrument, Cooder subsequently applied banjo tunings and the [[Scruggs style|three finger roll]] to guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roanoke.com/arts_and_entertainment/back-to-the-banjo-ry-cooder-returns-to-his-early/article_7a5f0c6d-d0d9-5af7-a83b-2fb2d0ea0644.html|title=Back to the banjo: Ry Cooder returns to his early instrument|website=Roanoke.com|date=August 13, 2015 |access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref>

Cooder first attracted attention playing with [[Captain Beefheart|Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band]], notably on the 1967 album ''[[Safe as Milk]]'', after previously having worked with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Ed Cassidy]] in the [[Rising Sons]]. At a vital "warm-up" performance at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival|Mt. Tamalpais Festival]] (June 10–11, 1967) shortly before the scheduled [[Monterey Pop Festival]] (June 16–18, 1967), the band began to play "[[Electricity (Captain Beefheart song)|Electricity]]" and [[Don Van Vliet]] froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} stage and landed on manager [[Bob Krasnow]]. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth.<ref>French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'', p.253. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref>
This aborted any opportunity for breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet,<ref>

[[Van Dyke Parks]] worked with Newman and Cooder during the 1960s. Parks arranged Cooder's "One Meatball" according to Parks' 1984 interview with Bob Claster.

Cooder was a [[session musician]] on various recording sessions with [[the Rolling Stones]] in 1968 and 1969, and his contributions appear on the albums ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' ([[Yank Rachell|Yank Rachell-style]] [[mandolin]] on "[[Love in Vain]]"), and ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', on which he contributed the slide guitar on "[[Sister Morphine]]". During this period, Cooder joined with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Charlie Watts]], [[Bill Wyman]], and longtime Rolling Stones [[sideman]] [[Nicky Hopkins]] to record ''[[Jamming with Edward!]]''. Cooder also played slide guitar for the 1970 film soundtrack ''[[Performance (soundtrack)|Performance]]'', which contained Jagger's first solo single, "[[Memo from Turner]]". The 1975 [[compilation album]] ''[[Metamorphosis (Rolling Stones album)|Metamorphosis]]'' features an uncredited Cooder contribution to Bill Wyman's "Downtown Suzie".

Cooder also collaborated with [[Lowell George]] of [[Little Feat]], playing [[slide guitar|bottleneck guitar]] on the original version of "[[Willin' (Little Feat song)|Willin']]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/little-feat-mw0000653350/credits|title=Little Feat – Little Feat &#124; Credits|website=AllMusic |access-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref> He also played bottleneck guitar and mandolin on two tracks on the Gordon Lightfoot album ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]]'' (later re-titled ''If You Could Read My Mind''), recorded in late 1969 and released in early 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rylanders.free-online.co.uk/RySite/RyPages/SitDownStranger.html |title=Gordon Lightfoot Sit Down Young Stranger |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Rylanders: Ry Cooder Discography|access-date=September 18, 2022}}</ref>

===1970s===
Throughout the 1970s, Cooder released a series of [[Warner Bros. Records]] albums that showcased his guitar work, initially on the [[Reprise Records]] label, before being reassigned to the main Warners label along with many of Reprise's artists when the company retired the imprint. Cooder explored bygone musical [[genres]] and found old-time recordings which he then personalized and updated. Thus, on his breakthrough album, ''[[Into the Purple Valley]]'', he chose unusual instrumentations and arrangements of blues, gospel, [[calypso music|calypso]], and country songs (giving a tempo change to the cowboy ballad "Billy the Kid"). The album opened with the song "How Can You Keep on Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)" by [[Agnes "Sis" Cunningham]] about the [[Okie]]s who were not welcomed when they migrated west to escape the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s – to which Cooder gave a rousing-yet-satirical march accompaniment. In 1970 he collaborated with Ron Nagle and performed on his ''Bad Rice'' album released on Warner Brothers. His later 1970s albums (with the exception of ''[[Jazz (Ry Cooder album)|Jazz]]'', which explored ragtime/vaudeville) do not fall under a single genre description, but his self-titled first album could be described as blues; ''Into the Purple Valley'', ''[[Boomer's Story]]'', and ''[[Paradise and Lunch]]'' as [[folk music|folk]] and blues; ''[[Chicken Skin Music]]'' and ''Showtime'' as a mix of [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] and [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]]; ''[[Bop Till You Drop]]'' as 1950s [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]; and ''[[Borderline (Ry Cooder album)|Borderline]]'' and ''Get Rhythm'' as rock-based. His 1979 album ''Bop Till You Drop'' was the first [[popular music]] album released that was [[digital recording|recorded digitally]], using the early 3M digital mastering recorder.<ref name="Mixonline 2007">{{cite web | title=1978 3M Digital Audio Mastering System | website=Mixonline | date=2007-09-01 | url=https://www.mixonline.com/technology/1978-3m-digital-audio-mastering-system-377974 | access-date=2023-03-18}}</ref> It yielded his biggest [[chart-topper|hit]], an R&B [[cover version]] of [[Elvis Presley]]'s 1960s recording "[[Little Sister (Elvis Presley song)|Little Sister]]".

Cooder is credited on [[Van Morrison]]'s 1979 album ''[[Into the Music]]'', for slide guitar on the song "[[Full Force Gale]]". He also played guitar on [[Judy Collins]]' 1970 concert tour, and is featured on ''[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]'', the 1971 live album recorded during that tour. He also learned from and performed with [[Gabby Pahinui]] and [[Leland Isaacs, Sr.|"Atta" Isaacs]] in Hawaii during the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] of the early 1970s. He is also credited for guitars on several 1971 recordings by [[Nancy Sinatra]] that were produced by Andy Wickman and Lenny Waronker – "Is Anybody Goin' To San Antone", "Hook & Ladder", and "Glory Road". Cooder is credited as a mandolin player on Gordon Lightfoot's ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' album in 1972.

===1980s===
Cooder has worked as a studio musician and has also scored many [[film soundtrack]]s including the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' (1984). Cooder based this soundtrack and title song "Paris, Texas" on [[Blind Willie Johnson]]'s "[[Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)]]", which he described as "the most soulful, transcendent piece in all American music".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/blindwilliejohnson_092803.html;COXnetJSessionID=1ITtL0zcaTYPiiTPLjP1a2lrfOo25kwasby2KrVda2n1BrlyX13b!-615020192?urac=n&urvf=10701094852420.8419290445454791"|title=The Soul of Blind Willie Johnson:Retracing the life of the Texas music icon|author=Corcoran, Michael|website=Austin360.com|access-date=September 5, 2011|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819061919/http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/blindwilliejohnson_092803.html|archive-date=August 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Musician [[Dave Grohl]] has declared Cooder's score for ''Paris, Texas'' one of his favorite albums.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYG5eRoSTJwC&pg=PA57 |page=57| last=Greenwald |first=Andy |title=The Chosen Foo|journal=Spin|date=August 2005}}</ref> In 2018 Cooder told [[BBC Radio 4]] listeners: "[Wenders] did a very good job at capturing the ambiance out there in the desert, just letting the microphones and the [[Nagra|nagra machine]] roll and get tones and sound from the desert itself, which I discovered was [[E♭ tuning|E♭]], was in the key of E♭ – that's the wind, you know, was nice. So we tuned everything to E♭."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p066rj49 "From Buena Vista to gospel and blues"]. ''BBC Radio 4: Best of Today'', 10 May 2018.</ref>

"Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)" was also the basis for Cooder's song "Powis Square" for the movie ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]''. His other film work includes [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981), ''[[Streets of Fire]]'' (1984), ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1985), ''[[Johnny Handsome]]'',<ref>''Johnny Handsome:Original Motion PictureSoundtrack'', Warner Bros.

Cooder, along with [[Arlen Roth]], dubbed all slide and regular blues guitar parts in the 1986 film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'', a take on blues legend [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. In 1988, Cooder produced the album by his longtime backing vocalists [[Bobby King]] and [[Terry Evans (musician)|Terry Evans]] on [[Rounder Records]] titled ''Live and Let Live''. He contributed his slide guitar work to every track. He also plays extensively on their 1990 self-produced Rounder release ''Rhythm, Blues, Soul & Grooves''. Cooder's music also appeared on two episodes of the television program ''Tales From the Crypt'': "The Man Who Was Death" and "The Thing From the Grave".<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/original-music-from-tales-from-the-crypt-w93724 Review of ''Tales From the Crypt''] by Steven McDonald, ''AllMusic.com''</ref>

In 1984, Cooder played on two songs on the debut album by Carla Olson & the Textones, ''Midnight Mission'' – "Carla's Number One is to Survive" and the previously unreleased [[Bob Dylan]] song "Clean Cut Kid". Shortly thereafter he was writing and recording the music for the film ''Blue City'' and asked the band to appear in the film performing. (He took them to the studio and produced "You Can Run" which he also played on.)

In 1985, Cooder was a guest artist on the song "Rough Edges" from [[Kim Carnes]]' album ''[[Barking at Airplanes]]''. Kim named her son Ry as a tribute to Ry Cooder.

Also in 1988, Cooder produced and featured in the [[Les Blank]]-directed concert documentary film ''Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball'' where he plays in collaboration with a selection of musicians famous in their various musical fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170532/|title=Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball (1988)|author=RondoHatton|date=August 31, 1991|work=IMDb|access-date=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The following year, he played a janitor in the [[Jim Henson]] series ''[[The Ghost of Faffner Hall]]'', in the episode "Music Is More Than Technique".<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/JvLkt_0dPP8 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130709013916/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 |title=The Jim Henson Company YouTube Channel |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=January 12, 2012 |access-date=June 10, 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Cooder collaborated on two [[world music]] "crossover" albums, which blended the traditional American musical genres that Cooder has championed throughout his career with the contemporary improvised music of India and Africa. For ''[[A Meeting by the River]]'' (1993), which also featured his son [[Joachim Cooder]] on percussion, he teamed with [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] classical musician [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt|V.M. Bhatt]], a virtuoso of the [[Mohan Veena]] (a modified 20-string [[archtop guitar]] of Bhatt's own invention) and Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari also known as Pinky Tabla Player.

In 1993 he teamed up with [[Mali]] a multi-instrumentalist [[Ali Farka Toure]] to record the album ''[[Talking Timbuktu]]'', which he also produced. The album, released in 1994, also featured longtime Cooder collaborator [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, veteran blues guitarist [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]], jazz bassist [[John Patitucci]] and African percussionists and musicians including [[Hamma Sankare]] and Oumar Toure. Both albums won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Global Music Album|Best World Music Album]] in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Cooder also worked with [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[Overtone singing|throat singers]] for the score to the 1993 film ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]''.

In 1995 he performed in ''[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True]]'', a musical performance of the popular story at the [[Lincoln Center]] in New York to benefit the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. The performance was originally broadcast on both TBS and TNT. It was issued on CD and video in 1996.

In the late 1990s Cooder played a significant role in the increased appreciation of traditional [[Cuba]]n music, due to his collaboration as producer of the ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1997) recording, which became a worldwide hit and revived the careers of some of the greatest surviving exponents of 20th century Cuban music. [[Wim Wenders]], who had previously directed 1984's ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'', directed a documentary film of the musicians involved, ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), which was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2000.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208064255/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 8, 2007 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007 |title=NY Times: Buena Vista Social Club |access-date=November 22, 2008}}</ref> The enterprise cost him a $25,000 fine for violating the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/04/jazz.popandrock|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Interview – From the Dust|date=March 3, 2007|access-date=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-feb-06-ca-21581-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=With Help From Up High, Cooder's Back in Cuba|author= Hancock, Jay|date=February 6, 2001|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref>

===2000s===
Cooder's 2005 album ''[[Chávez Ravine (album)|Chávez Ravine]]'' was touted by his [[record label]] as being "a post-World War II-era American narrative of 'cool cats', radios, UFO sightings, J. Edgar Hoover, red scares, and baseball".<ref name=Nonesuch>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/chavez-ravine|title= Chávez Ravine: About this album|date= May 29, 2008|publisher=Nonesuch Records|access-date=September 5, 2011}}</ref> The record is a tribute to the long-gone Los Angeles Latino enclave known as [[Chávez Ravine]]. Using real and imagined historical characters, Cooder and friends created an album that recollects various aspects of the poor but vibrant hillside [[Chicano]] community that no longer exists. Cooder says, "Here is some music for a place you don't know, up a road you don't go. Chávez Ravine, where the sidewalk ends."<ref name=Nonesuch/> Drawing from the various musical strains of Los Angeles, including [[conjunto]], R&B, Latin pop, and jazz, Cooder and friends conjure the ghosts of Chávez Ravine and Los Angeles at mid-century. On this fifteen-track album, sung in Spanish and English, Cooder is joined by [[East Los Angeles, California|East L.A.]] legends like Chicano music patriarch [[Lalo Guerrero]], [[Pachuco]] boogie king [[Don Tosti]], [[Thee Midniters]] front man Little Willie G, and Ersi Arvizu, of The Sisters and [[El Chicano]].

Cooder's next record was released in 2007. Entitled ''[[My Name Is Buddy]]'', it tells the story of Buddy Red Cat, who travels and sees the world in the company of his like-minded friends, Lefty Mouse and Rev. Tom Toad. The entire recording is a parable of the working class progressivism<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7719791|title=Cooder's 'Buddy' Revives Tales of a Bygone America|publisher=NPR Music|date= March 6, 2007 |access-date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> of the first half of the American twentieth century, and even has a song featuring executed unionist [[Joe Hill (activist)|Joe Hill]]. ''My Name Is Buddy'' was accompanied by a booklet featuring a story and illustration (by [[Vincent Valdez]]) for each track, providing additional context to Buddy's adventures.

Cooder produced and performed on an album for [[Mavis Staples]] entitled ''[[We'll Never Turn Back]]'', which was released on April 24, 2007. The [[concept album]] focused on [[Gospel music|Gospel]] songs of the [[civil rights movement]] and also included two new original songs by Cooder.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56405/mavis-staples-gets-personal-on-anti-debut|title=Mavis Staples Gets Personal On Anti-Debut|author1=Cohen, Jonathan  |author2=Martens, Todd |name-list-style=amp |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 19, 2006|access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

Cooder's album ''[[I, Flathead]]'' was released on June 24, 2008. It is the completion of his California trilogy. Based on the [[drag racing]] culture of the early 1960s, the album is set on the desert salt flats in southern California. The disc was also released as a deluxe edition with stories written by Cooder to accompany the music.

In late 2009, Cooder toured Japan, New Zealand, and Australia with [[Nick Lowe]], performing some of Lowe's songs and a selection of Cooder's own material, mainly from the 1970s. Joaquim Cooder (Ry's son) provided percussion, and [[Juliette Commagere]] and [[Alex Lilly]] contributed backing vocals.

The song "Diaraby", which Cooder recorded with [[Ali Farka Touré]], is used as the theme to ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'s'' Geo Quiz. ''The World'' is a radio show distributed by [[Public Radio International]].

In 2009, Cooder performed in ''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''. Cooder performed with Bob Dylan and Van Dyke Parks on the documentary broadcast on December 13, 2009, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. They played "[[Do Re Mi (Woody Guthrie song)|Do Re Mi]]" and reportedly a couple of other [[Woody Guthrie|Guthrie]] songs that were excluded from the final edit. He also traveled with the band [[Los Tigres del Norte]] and recorded the 2010 album ''[[San Patricio (album)|San Patricio]]'' with the Chieftains, [[Lila Downs]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Van Dyke Parks]], [[Los Cenzontles]], and Los Tigres.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/24/100524fa_fact_wilkinson |title=Onward and Upward with the Arts, "Immigration Blues"|author= Wilkinson, Alec |magazine=The New Yorker|date=May 24, 2010|access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069640/the-chieftains-featuring-ry-cooder-san-patricio|title=The Chieftains featuring Ry Cooder, "San Patricio"|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author= Wood, Mikael|date=March 5, 2010 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, he published a collection of short stories called ''[[Los Angeles Stories]]'', written about people living in Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s. The book's characters are mostly talented or skilled, clever or hardworking people living in humble circumstances.  With story titles such as "La vida es un sueño" and "Kill me, por favor", the collection's stories often have a Hispanic theme, and the book deals partially with Latinos living in Los Angeles during this time.

An ''[[American Songwriter]]'' article in 2012 suggested that Cooder's recent string of solo albums have often taken on an allegorical, sociopolitical bent. Music journalist Evan Schlansky said that "Cooder's latest effort, ''[[Election Special]]'' (released August 21, 2012, on Nonesuch/Perro Verde) doesn't mince words. It's designed to send a message to the 'deacons in the High Church of the Next Dollar'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/ry-cooder-breaks-down-the-songs-on-election-special/|title=Ry Cooder Breaks Down The Songs On Election Special|date=June 7, 2012|publisher=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> The album was composed in support of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and President [[Barack Obama]] in the 2012 election.

On September 10, 2013, Cooder released ''[[Live in San Francisco (Ry Cooder and Corridos Famosos album)|Live in San Francisco]]'', featuring the Corridos Famosos band, including [[Joachim Cooder]] on drums; [[Robert Francis (musician)|Robert Francis]] on bass; vocalists Terry Evans, [[Arnold McCuller]], and [[Juliette Commagere]]; [[Flaco Jiménez]] on accordion; and the Mexican brass band La Banda Juvenil. The album was recorded during a two-night run at [[Great American Music Hall]] in [[San Francisco]], August 31 and September 1, 2011. It is Cooder's first official live recording since ''Show Time'' in 1977 (which had also been recorded at Great American Music Hall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/nonesuch-perro-verde-records-release-ry-cooder-corridos-famosos-live-in-san-francisco-september-10-2013-07-23|title=Nonesuch / Perro Verde Records Release Ry Cooder and Corridos Famosos' "Live in San Francisco" September 10|date=July 23, 2013 |publisher=[[Nonesuch Records]]|access-date=August 19, 2013}}</ref>

Her fifth studio album, ''[[Wildflower (Sheryl Crow album)|Wildflower]]'', was released in September 2005.

However, she ultimately lost in both categories to [[Kelly Clarkson]]. The album got a new boost in 2006 when the second single was announced as "[[Always on Your Side]]", re-recorded with British musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and sent off to radio, where it was quickly embraced on [[Adult Top 40]]. The collaboration with Sting resulted in a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals]] at the [[49th Grammy Awards]].

===2017–2022: ''Be Myself'', ''Threads'' and ''Sheryl''===
Crow duets with Americana artist [[Rodney Crowell]] on the track "I'm Tied To Ya" from his album ''Close Ties'' which was released in March 2017. Crow's tenth studio album, ''[[Be Myself]]'', was released on April 21, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-sheryl-crow-be-myself-troubadour-20170303-story.html |title=Sheryl Crow previews new album at surprise Troubadour show |author=Lewis, Randy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 3, 2017 |access-date=April 7, 2017 |archive-date=March 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014550/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-sheryl-crow-be-myself-troubadour-20170303-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> It was co-produced by Crow, [[Jeff Trott]] and [[Tchad Blake]], and is the first time the latter has appeared on one of Crow's studio albums since ''The Globe Sessions'' in 1998.

You do lots of free [shows] for radio stations in trade for getting played between three and four in the morning. And that's just not how other formats work, and that goes against my grain.

Crow's 2019 album ''[[Threads (Sheryl Crow album)|Threads]]'' features contributions from, among others, Don Henley, [[Joe Walsh]], Sting, Stevie Nicks, [[Willie Nelson]], and Keith Richards. While promoting her UK tour, Crow released "Wouldn't Wanna Be Like You" featuring [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] and revealed that she intended for ''Threads'' to be her final album, citing the impossibility of releasing something that could follow-up such a gathering of artists.

==Instruments and signature model guitars==
Early in her career, Crow performed extensively with a 1962 [[Gibson Country Western]] guitar which was her personal favorite, but she eventually feared that it would not stand up to the rigors of continued touring and stage use, and in 1999 asked [[Gibson (guitar company)|Gibson]] to build her a replica for use on stage. The manufacturer responded by introducing a "Sheryl Crow" model in their Signature Artist Series, which is essentially a re-creation of the square-shouldered 1962-era Country Western model.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gibson.com/Guitars/Acoustic|title=Gibson Acoustic Guitars|website=Gibson.com|access-date=August 30, 2019|archive-date=June 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602011311/https://www.gibson.com/Guitars/Acoustic|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, Gibson also introduced a limited edition "Sheryl Crow [[Gibson Southern Jumbo|Southern Jumbo]]", a reissue of the slope-shouldered predecessor of the 1962-era Country Western.<ref name="auto"/>

'''The Blue Moon Boys''' were an American [[rock and roll]] band that was formed by [[Elvis Presley]], lead [[guitar]]ist [[Scotty Moore]] and [[double bass]] player [[Bill Black]]. The group members were introduced by [[Sun Studio]] owner [[Sam Phillips]] in 1954, except for drummer [[D.J. Fontana]], who joined the group during a [[Louisiana Hayride]] tour in 1955. The Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2007. The band was named after [[Bill Monroe|Bill Monroe's]] song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".

== Background ==
On July 18, 1953, [[Elvis Presley]] recorded a single at  [[Sun Studio]] as a gift for his [[Gladys Presley|mother]]'s birthday, the [[Ink Spots]]' "My Happiness", with "That's When Your Heartaches Begin" on the flipside.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| title=Where did Elvis Presley start his career?| publisher=elvislovemetender.com| access-date=2010-10-04| archive-date=2011-07-10| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710184750/http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| url-status=dead}}</ref>
Studio owner [[Sam Phillips]] was not there, so Presley's recording was managed by his secretary, [[Marion Keisker]], who kept a demo copy of the recording.<ref>Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-33225-9}}. Retrieved 2010-09-27.</ref>

At Phillips' behest Keisker called Presley for an appointment at the studio almost a year later; he returned on June 26, 1954.<ref name=Historyofrock>{{cite web | url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/sam_phillips_sun_records_two.htm| title=Sam Phillips' Sun Records| publisher=history-of-rock.com|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref> Although most of the session was not recorded, Phillips was impressed by Presley and introduced him to the [[country music]] band [[Starlight Wranglers]]' guitarist [[Scotty Moore]], who later introduced Presley to double bass player [[Bill Black]].<ref name=Hillbilly>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| title=Elvis Aaron Presley 1953-1955: The Hillbilly Cat.| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au| access-date=2010-09-27| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921184326/http://elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| archive-date=2010-09-21}}</ref>

== Sun recordings ==
On July 5, 1954, the trio headed to the Sun Studios for a recording test together. They recorded the songs "Harbor Lights" and "[[I Love You Because]]", and during a break they performed an impromptu version of [[Arthur Crudup]]'s "[[That's All Right]]", which impressed Phillips, who asked for a refinement of the interpretation that later was recorded.<ref name=Historyofrock/> 
Phillips played the recording for [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]]'s [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Dewey Phillips]], who played the song on his regular show next night, on July 8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lyrics.elvispresley.com.au/lyrics/thats_all_right_mama.html| title=That's Alright| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref>
On July 9, the trio recorded what became the flipside to "That's All Right", an uptempo [[rockabilly]] version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/show_pic.php?key=3318&type=ls | title=Rockin' Country Style| publisher=rcs-discography.com|access-date = 2010-09-27}}</ref>  
The single was released on July 19, 1954,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elvicities.com/~elvis100/songsbluemoonof.htm | title=Blue Moon of Kentucky| publisher=elvicities.com|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref> and was a local hit in [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]] and [[New Orleans]].<ref name=Hillbilly/>

== Live appearances ==
[[File:The Blue Moon Boys2.jpg|200px|thumb|Left to right: Scotty Moore (guitar), Bill Black (double bass), [[D.J. Fontana]] (drums)]]
[[Scotty Moore]] became the manager of the band, and they toured several cities in the south, the three members still working at their regular employments when not touring.<ref name=LastTrain>Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-33225-9}}.</ref> Both Moore and Black focused more on the group after they let Presley perform at the regular Starlight Wranglers show on the Bon Air club, where the reception of the audience was unfavorable, and led to animosity between them and the other members of the group for having to leave the stage.<ref name=Hillbilly/>
The Blue Moon Boys appeared on a regular basis at Eagle's Nest club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elvisconcerts.com/liv1954.htm| title=1954.

After the failure, Phillips contacted Opry's main competition, the [[Louisiana Hayride]]. They made their first appearance on October 16, 1954.<ref name=Hillbilly/> Presley sang "That's All Right" followed by the flipside of the record, "Blue Moon of Kentucky". The performance was well received and they signed a one-year contract to be official members of the Hayride,<ref name=ElvisHayride>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/ElvisHayride1.html| title=Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel, Memphis| publisher=yahoo.com| access-date=2010-09-28| archive-date=2018-09-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927110604/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/ElvisHayride1.html| url-status=dead}}</ref> while Presley also signed a new management contract with [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]].<ref name=ElvisHayride/> 
On August 8, [[D.J. Fontana]] joined the band as the [[Drums|drummer]] on a regular basis after having played occasionally with them, the first time in [[Shreveport]] and subsequently on tour.<ref name=Hillbilly/>
After disputes with [[Hank Snow]]'s manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker|Tom Parker]], who booked most of Presley's appearances, Bob Neal turned over the contract to Colonel Parker who became officially Presley's manager on December 15, 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=colonel-tom-parker| title=Elvis On The Road: 1955-56| publisher=pophistorydig.com| access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref>

'''Thomas Wade''' (born May 9, 1961) is a Canadian [[country music|country]] artist. He was the lead singer of the group '''Thomas Wade & Wayward''', who released their eponymous debut album in 1996.<ref name="xentel">{{Cite web |url=http://www.xentel.com/xentel/events/wright.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 15, 2008 |archive-date=June 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601190314/http://www.xentel.com/xentel/events/wright.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album produced seven singles on the Canadian country music chart, including the top 10s "Zero to Sixty" and "She's Getting Serious". Between 1997 and 1999, Thomas Wade & Wayward received seven CCMA awards, winning best group or duo three times, and both independent single and song awards for '97 and '98. The group was also nominated for three [[Juno Award]]s for [[Juno Award for Country Recording of the Year|Best Country Group or Duo]] in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Between 1996 and 2001, Wade placed twelve videos in the top twenty on [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]], including the number one "Lying Here with You'".

Wade launched a solo career in 2000 when he signed to Shoreline Records and released his debut album, ''Lucky 13''. Five singles were released from the album, including the top 10 "Running Away with You". Following the release of a career retrospective in 2001, ''So Far'', Wade was diagnosed with [[oromandibular dystonia]].<ref name="cmn">{{Cite web |url=http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=1168 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 15, 2008 |archive-date=April 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430043546/http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=1168 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While he was forced to end his recording career, he has continued his career as a songwriter. [[Celine Dion]] included one of Wade's songs, "Come to Me", on her 2004 album ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]''.<ref name="cmn" /> Due to cutting-edge work in [[neuroplasticity]], Wade began to heal early in 2010 and as of May 2015 went into the studio to record a new album called ''Blue Country Soul'' at Phase One Studios in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. Largely co-written with Canadian songwriter Tim Taylor, this record is a return to Wade's musical roots, the music of the fifties, [[classic country]] and [[blues]] as well as a musical reunion with bassist John Dymond, keyboardist Steve O'Connor and drummer Gary Craig. As of 2016, Wade has been touring again as a headlining act. A book and a documentary is in production about his career and battle with dystonia.

'''Todd Daniel Snider''' (born October 11, 1966) <ref>{{cite book |last= Larkin |first= Colin |date= 2009 |title= Encyclopedia of Popular Music |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313734.001.0001/acref-9780195313734-e-73223?rskey=3jwPcM&result=24917 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780199726363}}</ref> is an American singer-songwriter whose music incorporates elements of folk, rock, blues, alt country, and funk.

==Early career==
Snider was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], but was raised in nearby [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], where he lived until he graduated from [[Beaverton High School]] in 1985. After high school, he moved to [[Santa Rosa, California]], to attend [[Santa Rosa Junior College]]. He only lasted one semester, but while there, he learned to play the harmonica.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Shapiro | first = Michael | title = Todd Snider recalls his Santa Rosa days | newspaper = [[The Press Democrat]] | date = September 21, 2014 | url = https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/entertainment/todd-snider-recalls-his-santa-rosa-days/ |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

With help from his brother Mike who bought him a plane ticket, Snider relocated to [[San Marcos, Texas]], after leaving SRJC in late fall of 1985.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn't Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 78–79 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref> Not long after he arrived in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], Snider saw [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] perform solo at [[Gruene Hall]], a legendary dance hall in [[New Braunfels, Texas]].<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> When he saw Walker that night, he decided he wanted to become a songwriter and began writing songs the next day.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy |date= April 14, 2012 |title= It All Started One Night in the '80s at Gruene Hall |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/us/todd-snider-records-a-tribute-to-jerry-jeff-walker.html |newspaper= The New York Times |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> He told ''Lone Star Music Magazine'' in 2004, "I didn't even know how to really play guitar yet, but I saw his show and went and got one."<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider met [[Kent Finlay]] at his very first writer's night, which was at Finlay's San Marcos club, [[Cheatham Street Warehouse]]. Finlay, who was a songwriter in his own right, became an important mentor and introduced Snider to the songs of [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Guy Clark]], [[John Prine]], and [[Shel Silverstein]], among others.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider soon was packing small rooms in San Marcos and over the next few years began to draw enthusiastic crowds in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], as well.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y'Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider also discovered [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] songwriter [[Keith Sykes (musician)|Keith Sykes]] while living in San Marcos when a friend at the local record store turned him on to a pair of albums Sykes made in the early ’70s.<ref>{{cite news |last= Boehm |first= Mike |date= July 29, 1995 |title= Country's Todd Snider: The Man of Still : Pop: The genre has changed over the years, but the artist remains true to traditional styles, as his 'Songs for the Daily Planet' shows |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-29-ca-29116-story.html |newspaper= Los AngelesTimes |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> In 1989, Snider's father moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and happened to meet Sykes’ sister-in-law. Through that connection, Snider sent Sykes a demo tape of some of his songs. Sykes thought one of the songs had potential, so Snider moved to Memphis to try to work with Sykes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn't Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 86–87 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref>

Not long after he arrived in Memphis, Snider landed a weekly residency at a local club The Daily Planet. He not only was soon packing the room, the audience knew the words to the songs and would sing along.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 267 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref>

Through Sykes, Snider met [[John Prine]] in 1991 while assisting on pre-production work Prine was doing with Sykes in Memphis for his album ''[[The Missing Years (album)|The Missing Years]]''. It was the beginning of a friendship that would last until Prine's death in 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Bernstein |first= Jonathan |date= April 8, 2020 |title= Todd Snider on John Prine: 'I Couldn't Believe I Knew Him'|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/todd-snider-remembers-john-prine-980532/ |magazine= Rolling Stone |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

In 1992, Sykes helped Snider land a development deal with [[Capitol Records]]. He recorded a number of sides in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] for the label,<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y'Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> but they declined to pick up his option for a full album.<ref>{{cite book |last= Leaver |first= Jack |date= 1997 |title= All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings |chapter= ToddSnider |publisher= Backbeat |page= 432 |isbn= 9780879304751}}</ref>

Around the time of the Capitol deal, Snider began performing with a small band backing him which he dubbed the Bootleggers.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The band's lineup fluctuated some over the first year or so, but by the end of 1994, the lineup was set with [[Will Kimbrough]] on guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, and Joe McLeary on drums. Snider also had changed the band's name to the Nervous Wrecks.

Sykes was a one-time member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]’s [[Coral Reefer Band]] and Buffett had recorded a few of his songs, so when the Capitol deal fell through, he reached out on Snider's behalf to Buffett's label, Margaritaville Records, which was distributed by [[MCA Records|MCA]]. Not long after label exec Bob Mercer saw Snider perform at an industry showcase in Memphis in April 1993, Snider flew to California to open a show for Buffett. After seeing his set, Buffett offered Snider a deal with Margaritaville.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 268 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's debut album for Margaritaville, ''[[Songs for the Daily Planet]]'', was released in 1994 and reached number 23 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= February 4, 1995 |title= Heatseekers Albums |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-02-04-Billboard-Page-0026.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 26 |access-date= July 26, 2011}}</ref> Produced by [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Mike Utley]], the album was literally composed of songs he was playing at the Daily Planet nightclub in Memphis. Although there were a few guest musicians and singers on the record, the core lineup was Snider on acoustic guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, Joe McLeary on drums, Utley on keys, Eddie Shaver on electric guitar, and Peter Hyrka on mandolin, acoustic guitar, and violin.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Songs-For-The-Daily-Planet/release/1906404 |title= Todd Snider – Songs for the Daily Planet |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The record included a hidden track, "Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues," which became a minor radio hit, reaching No. 31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Album Rock Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= January 7, 1995 |title= AlbumRock Tracks |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-01-07-Billboard-Page-0097.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 103 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> A talking blues for Gen-X, the song mocked the early ’90s grunge scene and featured a band that refused to play.

Snider's second album for Margaritaville/MCA, ''Step Right Up'', was released on April 23, 1996, and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' proclaimed it "more stunning than his debut."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Borzillo |first= Carrie|date= May 4, 1996 |title= Stepping Up |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9gsEAAAAMBAJ&dq=todd+snider+%22step+right+up%22&pg=PA20|magazine= Billboard |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]] were coproducers with Snider, and Utley backed Snider and the Wrecks on keyboards.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/step-right-up-mw0000186371/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Step Right Up'': Credits |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= AllMusic |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's third album, ''Viva Satellite'', represented a turning point in his career. Prior to making the record, Margaritaville left MCA and signed with Island Records for distribution. But MCA retained rights to Snider's recordings, so they would release the album. No longer recording for Margaritaville or working with [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]], Snider produced some sides at engineer Justin Niebank's studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with mixed success. Only one of the tracks he cut there would make the album, the finale "Doublewide Blues." Snider recorded the rest of the album at Ardent Studios in Memphis with producer-engineer John Hampton. He was backed by [[Will Kimbrough|Kimbrough]] on guitar, Mariencheck on bass, [[Paul Buchignani]] on drums, and Rick Steff on keys, and the result was a more straight-ahead rock record than his first two.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Viva-Satellite/release/4832355 |title= Todd Snider –Viva Satellite |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> Shortly before the album was released in May 1998, there was trouble at a private performance in L.A. for MCA execs and their staffs. Snider, who was struggling with drugs at the time, insulted those in attendance early in the set and then left the stage. Not long thereafter, MCA released him from his contract.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

===2000s===
====Oh Boy years====
After leaving MCA, Snider disbanded the Nervous Wrecks and signed with [[John Prine]]’s independent label, [[Oh Boy Records]]. Oh Boy released his fourth album, ''Happy To Be Here'', on April 18, 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= April 10, 2000 |title= Upcoming Releases |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XNPgrOvoqUkC&dq=todd+snider+happy+to+be+here&pg=PA37 |journal= CMJ New Music Report |pages= 37 |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Working with producer [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]], Snider recorded all the songs solo acoustic, then additional instrumentation was added to his guitar and vocal tracks.<ref>{{cite news |last= Lang |first= George |date= September 21, 2001 |title= Grunge survivor Todd Snider happy to be in the music business |url= https://www.oklahoman.com/article/2755931/grunge-survivor-todd-snider-happy-to-be-in-music-business |newspaper= The Oklahoman  |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Besides Kennedy who played a variety of instruments on the record, guitarists [[Pat Buchanan (musician)|Pat Buchanan]] and [[Will Kimbrough]], bassists [[Joey Spampinato]] and Keith Christopher, keyboardist [[Johnny Neel]], drummer [[Paul Buchignani]], multi-instrumentalist [[Peter Holsapple]], violinist [[Tammy Rogers]], and horn men Jim Hoke and [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] all contributed to the album.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Happy-To-Be-Here/release/4899891 |title= Todd Snider – Happy To Be Here |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Oh Boy released Snider's second album for the label, ''[[New Connection]]'', on May 14, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://toddsnider.bandcamp.com/album/new-connection|title= Todd Snider |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= BandCamp |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Produced by R.S.

Prior to the song's release on ''New Connection'', [[Garth Brooks]] released a duet with [[George Jones]] in November 2001 that had the same title and same primary lyrical hook. Snider's manager wondered whether the song Brooks and Jones recorded infringed on his song of the same name, but ultimately it was concluded that while similar, their song had been written independently of Snider's.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/what-todd-snider-really-thinks-about-garth-brooks/ |title= What Todd Snider Really Thinks About Garth Brooks |last= Trigger |date= May 11, 2014 |website= SavingCountryMusic.com |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's final studio album for Oh Boy, ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', was released on July 20, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/east-nashville-skyline-mw0000656524 |title= Todd Snider – ''East Nashville Skyline'' |last= Latham |first= Aaron |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> For the first time, Snider took full creative control of his record-making process,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sanders |first= Daryl |date= March 2011 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville's Ambassador to the World |url= https://www.theeastnashvillian.com/todd-snider/ |journal= The East Nashvillian |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> and the result was an album that was both a musical and cultural breakthrough.

In addition to guitarist Kimbrough and multi-instrumentalist McCullough, he was backed on the sessions by a who's who of East Nashville musicians, including guitarist Tim Carroll, bassists Dave Jacques and Dave Roe, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, and pianist John Deadrick. ''East Nashville Skyline'' included two iconic songs that added to the songwriting canon: "Play a Train Song" pushed the boundaries of "train" songs with the story of a man who was known for always requesting that kind of song, and "The Ballad of the Kingsmen" took the talking blues to a more contemporary place musically while connecting the censorship of "[[Louie Louie]]" culturally to the Columbine shootings.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-East-Nashville-Skyline/release/2657758 |title= Todd Snider –East NashvilleSkyline |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' called the album "the wittiest and feistiest album of his career."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Deusner |first= Stephen M. |date= December 14, 2004 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville Skyline |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7797-east-nashville-skyline/ |journal= Pitchfork |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it "a slacker wakeup call."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider|title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 }}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' ranked it the seventh-best album of 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/best2004-041228-gilstrap-2496022811.html |title= Best of 2004 |last= Gilstrap |first= Andrew |date= December 28, 2004 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''East Nashville Skyline'' reached No. 28 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= August 7, 2004 |title= Top Independent Albums |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5BIEAAAAMBAJ&dq=east+nashville+skyline%2C+todd+snider&pg=PA61 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 61 |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref>

After ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', Snider moved to Bob Mercer's New Door Records label which was distributed by [[Universal Music Group]], but Oh Boy would issue one more album of his music. On April 3, 2007, the label released ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'', a compilation of previously unreleased recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-love-and-anarchy-rarities-b-sides-and-demos-vol-1-mw0000747312 |title= Todd Snider – ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'' |last= Deming |first= Mark |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> Notable among the collection's fourteen tracks is the song "East Nashville Skyline" which was intended to be the title track of the album of the same name but Snider did not finish it in time to make the album.

====New Door years====
While Snider was working on his first record for New Door, UMG issued a selection of his Margaritaville and MCA back catalog. The collection, ''That Was Me: 1994-1998'', was released on August 30, 2005,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/that-was-me-the-best-of-todd-snider-1994-1998-mw0000417484 |title= Todd Snider – ''That Was Me: The Best of Todd Snider 1994-1998'' |last= Monger |first= James Christopher |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> through their reissue arm, Hip-O Records.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-That-Was-Me-1994-1998/release/2126555 |title= Todd Snider – That Was Me: 1994-1998 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 10, 2021}}</ref> The compilation included seventeen tracks from all three of the albums distributed by MCA, including "Alright Guy" and "Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues," plus a previously unreleased cover of "Margaritaville, a breakneck rendition on which he was backed by the Nervous Wrecks.

Snider's first release for New Door was ''The Devil You Know'', the acclaimed follow-up to ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'' released on August 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-devil-you-know-mw0000571780 |title= Todd Snider – ''The Devil You Know'' |last= Ruhlman |first= William |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> Working again with co-producers [[Will Kimbrough]] and Eric McConnell, who both played multiple instruments on the album, Snider also was backed on the record by guitarist [[Tommy Womack]], bassists Billy Mercer, Robert Kearns, and Dave Jacques, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, pianist [[Dave Zollo]], violinist Molly Thomas, and legendary steel guitarist [[Lloyd Green]].<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-The-Devil-You-Know/release/4186777 |title= Todd Snider – The Devil You Know |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 10, 2021}}</ref> The record went to number four on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= August 25, 2006 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it "better" than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider |title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 13, 2021 }}</ref> The record was named to several critics' year-end "best" lists, including a number 33 ranking in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s top 50 albums of the year,{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}} a number 25 ranking by ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' magazine, and number 14 by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine.

On October 20, 2006, Snider made a solo acoustic in-store appearance at Grimey's New and Preloved Records in Nashville, performing material from ''The Devil You Know''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Live-At-Grimeys-Nashville/release/2444867 |title= Todd Snider – Live With The Devil You Know At Grimey's Nashville 10.20.06 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> The performance was recorded and released by New Door on April 3, 2007, as ''Live With The Devil You Know At Grimey's Nashville 10.20.06''. It was his final release on the New Door label.

====Launch of Aimless Records====
In 2008, Snider launched his own independent record label, Aimless Records. The label's first release was his eight-song EP ''[[Peace Queer]]'', the most political record of his career. The title was inspired by the ’60s avant garde rock band [[The Fugs]] who had a line about killing "peace queers."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jambase.com/article/todd-snider-is-so-queer |title= Todd Snider Is So Queer |last= Cook |first= Dennis |date= October 23, 2008 |website= Jambase |publisher= |access-date= August 13, 2021 }}</ref> As Snider tells it in the press bio for the album, he was kidnapped by an international league of peace queers who forced him to write the protest songs that appeared on the record. Three of the tracks on the EP were recorded at co-producer Eric McConnell's studio with backing from some of the musicians who worked on Snider's two previous albums, including guitarist [[Will Kimbrough]], bassist Dave Jacques, keyboardist [[Dave Zollo]], and drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright. The remainder of the EP was recorded with co-producer [[Doug Lancio]] at his studio with Lancio providing musical accompaniment and [[Patty Griffin]] contributing backing vocals to two of the tracks — "Cape Henry" and the cover of John Fogerty's "[[Fortunate Son]]." Released on October 14, 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-queer-mw0000795517/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Peace Queer'': Credits |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> the record went to number one on the Americana Airplay Chart and number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= October 31, 2008 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

====Yep Roc album====
Aimless did not release Snider's next album, ''[[The Excitement Plan]]'', because he had already committed it to Yep Roc Records, but it would be the last record he would make for another record label. Produced by [[Don Was]] and released on June 9, 2009, the album featured Snider with minimal backing: Was on upright bass, [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, and [[Greg Leisz]] on dobro and pedal steel.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-excitement-plan-mw0000817699/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''The Excitement Plan'': Credits  |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''PopMatters'' called the record "a masterwork of intimacy" and said it "solidified his place among the masters of the form."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/94859-todd-snider-the-excitement-plan-2496036027.html |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |last= Henderson |first= Stuart |date= June 16, 2009 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> The Associated Press called it "the finest album of his career."<ref>{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Music Review: Snider finds humor in tough times |url= https://www.deseret.com/2009/6/8/20322379/music-review-snider-finds-humor-in-tough-times |newspaper= Deseret News |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave it four stars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Hermes |first= Will |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/27999157/review/28565381/the_excitement_plan |magazine= Rolling Stone |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613014403/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/27999157/review/28565381/the_excitement_plan |access-date= August 13, 2021|archive-date= June 13, 2009 }}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it a B+ in his Consumer Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider |title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 }}</ref> The album went to number six on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> and number 31 on the magazine's Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/ind/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Independent Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

===2010s===
====Aimless label years====
On February 1, 2011, Aimless released a double-disc live album by Snider, ''Live: The Storyteller''.

'''John Townes Van Zandt'''<ref name="tvzfaq" /> (March 7, 1944 – January 1, 1997) was an American singer-songwriter.<ref name="onion">[https://www.avclub.com/articles/be-here-to-love-me-a-film-about-townes-van-zandt,4187 "Be Here to Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt: Review"]. Avclub.com. Accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> He wrote numerous songs, such as "[[Pancho and Lefty]]", "[[For the Sake of the Song#Composition|For the Sake of the Song]]", "[[If I Needed You]]", "Snake Mountain Blues", "Our Mother the Mountain", "Waitin' Round to Die", and "[[To Live Is to Fly]]". His musical style has often been described as melancholic and features rich, poetic lyrics. During his early years, Van Zandt was respected for his guitar playing and [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] ability.

Much of Van Zandt's life was spent touring various bars, music clubs, colleges, and folk venues and festivals, often lodging in motel rooms or the homes of friends. He suffered from drug addiction and [[alcoholism]], and was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. When he was young, the now-discredited [[insulin shock therapy]] erased much of his [[long-term memory]].<ref name="townesvanzandt.com" />

In 1983, [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]] covered and popularized Van Zandt's song "Pancho and Lefty", reaching number one on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard country music]] chart.<ref name="allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p133926|pure_url=yes}} "Townes Van Zandt]: Biography". [[AllMusic.com]]. Accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> Van Zandt's influence has been cited by countless artists across multiple genres and his music has been recorded or performed by [[Bob Dylan]], Willie Nelson, [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Whitey Morgan]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Robert Earl Keen]] Jr., [[Nanci Griffith]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Wade Bowen]], [[Gillian Welch]], [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]], [[Pat Green]], [[Colter Wall]], [[Billy Strings]], [[Molly Tuttle]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Calvin Russell (musician)|Calvin Russell]], [[Natalie Maines]], [[Jason Molina]], [[Kevin Morby]], [[Stephen Duffy]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Frank Turner]], [[Rowland S. Howard]], [[Tindersticks]], [[Cave In]], [[Amenra]], [[Charley Crockett]], [[Tyler Childers]] and [[Marissa Nadler]].

Van Zandt died on New Year's Day 1997 from [[Heart arrhythmia|cardiac arrythmia]] caused by health problems stemming from years of substance abuse. A revival of interest in Van Zandt blossomed in the 2000s. During the decade, two books, a documentary film (''[[Be Here to Love Me]]''), and numerous magazine articles were written about him.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], into a wealthy family, Van Zandt was a great-great-great-grandson of [[Isaac Van Zandt]] (a prominent leader of the [[Republic of Texas]]) and a great-great-grandnephew of [[Khleber Miller Van Zandt]] (a major in the Confederate army and one of the founders of Fort Worth).<ref name="townesvanzandt.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.townesvanzandt.com/ta_unedited.html |title=Townes Van Zandt – A Far Cry From Dead |last=Manion|first=Jim |publisher=Totally Adult Review |date=July 16, 1999 |access-date=May 8, 2011  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717081153/http://www.townesvanzandt.com/ta_unedited.html |archive-date=July 17, 2011  }} (archived at TownesVanZandt.com)</ref>

Townes' parents were Harris Williams Van Zandt and Dorothy Townes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnwpest.org/coopl/tvzfaq.html|title=Townes Van Zandt – Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Pnwpest.org|access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref> He had two siblings, Bill (1949–2009) and Donna (1941–2011). Harris was a [[corporate lawyer]] and his career required the family to move several times during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="deeperblue14-16">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|pp=14–16}}</ref> In 1952, the family relocated from Fort Worth to [[Midland, Texas]] for six months before moving to [[Billings, Montana]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

At Christmas in 1956, Townes's father gave him a guitar, which he practiced while wandering the countryside.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews/book_review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003716748 ''A Deeper Kind of Blue''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223160052/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews/book_review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003716748 |date=December 23, 2008 }} (review). Billboard charts.</ref> He later told an interviewer that "seeing [[Elvis Presley]] on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' was the starting point for me becoming a guitar player... I just thought that Elvis had all the money in the world, all the [[Cadillacs]] and all the girls, and all he did was play the guitar and sing. That made a big impression on me."<ref name="tvzfaq" /> In 1958, the family moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Van Zandt remembered his time in Colorado fondly and often visited it as an adult. He later referred to Colorado in "My Proud Mountains", "Colorado Girl", and "Snowin' on Raton". Townes was a good student and active in team sports.<ref name="deeperblue17">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=17}}</ref> In grade school, he was found to have a high IQ, and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator.<ref name="tm">{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/1998-03-01/feature6.php|title=The Great, Late Townes Van Zandt|work=Texas Monthly|date=March 1, 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828052107/http://texasmonthly.com/1998-03-01/feature6.php|archive-date=August 28, 2008}}</ref> Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the [[Shattuck-Saint Mary's|Shattuck School]] in Faribault, Minnesota.<ref name="deeperblue25">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=25}}</ref> He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962.<ref name="deeperblue27">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=27}}</ref> His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.

In 1962, he enrolled at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], wrote poetry, and listened to records by [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] and [[Hank Williams]]. In the spring of his second year, his parents flew to Boulder to bring Townes back to Houston, worried about his binge drinking and episodes of depression.<ref name="tm" /> They admitted him to the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in Galveston, where he was diagnosed with manic depression. He received three months of [[insulin shock therapy]], which erased much of his [[long-term memory]].<ref name="townesvanzandt.com" /><ref name="tm" /> Afterwards, his mother said that her "biggest regret in life was that she had allowed that treatment to occur".<ref name="JTVZ">{{YouTube|2t_X9WXvF5E|"J.T. Van Zandt"}} (video).</ref> In 1965, he was accepted into the [[University of Houston]]'s pre-law program. Soon after, he attempted to join the Air Force, but was rejected because of a doctor's diagnosis that labelled him "an acute manic-depressive who has made minimal adjustments to life".<ref name="tm" /> After Townes's father died in January 1966 at age 52, he quit school and went on the road for the first time having been inspired by his singer-songwriter heroes to pursue a career in playing music.<ref name="tm"/>

=== Early musical career ===
In 1965, Van Zandt began playing regular shows at the Jester Lounge in Houston for $10 per night.<ref name="nrk">{{YouTube|ZRb4SIkOSWg|"Townes Van Zandt – interview in Oslo (NRK Lydverket)"}} (video).</ref> After the Jester closed, he began to regularly perform (and occasionally live) at [[Sand Mountain Coffee House]].<ref name="deeperblue14-16" /> In these Houston clubs, he met fellow musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and [[Doc Watson]]. His repertoire consisted mostly of covers of songs written by Hopkins, [[Bob Dylan]], and others, as well as original novelty songs like "Fraternity Blues."<ref name="deeperblue60">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=60}}</ref> In 1966, Harris Van Zandt had encouraged his son to stop playing covers and write his own songs.<ref name="deeperblue212">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=212}}</ref>

At one point around 1968, Van Zandt was roommates with [[13th Floor Elevators]] singer [[Roky Erickson]]. Erickson suggested that he audition as  the Elevators' new bassist, even though he was a guitarist who had never played bass before. When Tommy Hall found  out he never played bass, he kicked him out of the audition.

In 1968, Van Zandt met songwriter [[Mickey Newbury]] in a Houston coffee shop. Newbury persuaded Van Zandt to go to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was introduced by Newbury to the man who became his longtime producer, [[Jack Clement|"Cowboy" Jack Clement]].

Van Zandt cited Lightnin' Hopkins, Bob Dylan, and Hank Williams and such varied artists as [[Muddy Waters]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Blind Willie McTell]], [[Tchaikovsky]], and [[Jefferson Airplane]] as having had a major impact on his music.<ref name="tvzfaq" />

=== 1970s ===
The years between 1968 and 1973 proved to be his most prolific era.<ref name="allmusic" /> Van Zandt released six albums during the time period: ''[[For the Sake of the Song]]'', ''[[Our Mother the Mountain]]'', ''[[Townes Van Zandt (album)|Townes Van Zandt]]'', ''[[Delta Momma Blues]]'', ''[[High, Low and In Between]]'', and ''[[The Late Great Townes Van Zandt]]''. Among the tracks written for these albums were "To Live Is to Fly", "[[Pancho and Lefty]]", and "[[If I Needed You]]". These songs eventually raised Van Zandt to near-legend status in American and European songwriting circles.<ref name="allmusic" />

In 1972, he recorded tracks for an album with a working title of ''Seven Come Eleven'', which remained unreleased for many years due to a dispute between his manager Kevin Eggers and producer Jack Clement. Eggers either could not or refused to pay for the studio sessions, so Clement erased the master tapes. However, before they were deleted, Eggers sneaked into the studio and recorded rough mixes of the songs on to a [[cassette tape]]. Tracks from the aborted ''Seven Come Eleven'' debacle later surfaced on ''The Nashville Sessions''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1975, Van Zandt was featured prominently in the documentary film ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'' with [[Guy Clark]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Gamble Rogers]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and [[David Allan Coe]]. His segment of the film was shot at his run-down trailer home in Austin, Texas, where Van Zandt is shown drinking straight whiskey during the middle of the day, shooting and playing with guns, and performing the songs "Waitin' Around to Die" and "Pancho and Lefty."<ref name="Heartworn Highways">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405963 ''Heartworn Highways'' profile], imdb.com; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> His soon-to-be second wife Cindy and dog Geraldine (a large, "keenly intelligent" half-wolf, half-husky) are featured in the film.<ref name="dallasmusic">[http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-10-24/music/the-way-of-the-gun "The Way of the Gun – Living up to his famous father is a tall order for J.T. Van Zandt"], dallasobserver.com, October 24, 2002.</ref>

In 1977, ''[[Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas]]'' was released. The album showcased Van Zandt solo at a 1973 concert before a small audience, and less elaborately produced than many of his early records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blurt-online.com/reviews/view/504|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108123243/http://www.blurt-online.com/reviews/view/504/|archive-date=January 8, 2009|title=Townes Van Zandt: Live at the Old Quarter |date=October 20, 2008|publisher=BlurtOnline.com}}</ref> The album received positive reviews,<ref name="rsoq">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/townesvanzandt/albums/album/126626/review/5945364/live_at_the_old_quarter_houston_texas|title=Townes Van Zandt – Live At The Old Quarter, Houston, Texas|website=RollingStone.com|access-date=July 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319225150/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/townesvanzandt/albums/album/126626/review/5945364/live_at_the_old_quarter_houston_texas|archive-date=March 19, 2007}}</ref> and is considered by many to be among the best albums that the songwriter ever released.<ref name="rsoq" /><ref name="pmftsots">{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/vanzandttownes-reissues|title=Townes Van Zandt: For the Sake of the Song|publisher=PopMatters.com|access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name="deeperblue130">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=130}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Van Zandt split from his longtime manager, Kevin Eggers.<ref name="allmusic" /> He found a new manager, [[John Lomax III]] (grandson of the famed folk music historian [[John Lomax]]), who set up a fan club for Van Zandt.<ref name="utr">{{cite magazine|url=http://undertheradarmag.com/margaretbrown.html|title=Interview with Margaret Brown|magazine=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under The Radar]]|last=Tinkham|first=Chris|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522035249/http://undertheradarmag.com/margaretbrown.html|archive-date=May 22, 2006|access-date=April 7, 2013}}</ref> Though the club was only advertised through small ads in the back of music magazines, Lomax immediately began to receive hundreds of impassioned letters from around the world written by people who felt touched by Van Zandt. Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression.<ref name="utr" /> In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, [[Tomato Records]].<ref name="allmusic" /> The following year, he recorded ''[[Flyin' Shoes]]''; he did not release another album until 1987's ''[[At My Window (album)|At My Window]]''. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.<ref name="dallasmusic" />

=== 1980s–1990s ===
Several of Van Zandt's compositions were recorded by other artists, such as [[Emmylou Harris]] who, with [[Don Williams]], had a No. 3 country hit in 1981 with "[[If I Needed You]]," and [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]], the pair taking "Pancho and Lefty" to No. 1 on the country charts in 1983. Van Zandt had a small cameo appearance in the video for the song. In his later years, he recorded less frequently, his voice and singing style altered in part because of his drug addiction and alcoholism. However, he continued writing songs, such as "Marie" and "The Hole".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

According to Susanna Clark, Van Zandt turned down repeated invitations to write with Bob Dylan.<ref name="deeperblue203">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=203}}</ref> Dylan was reportedly a "big fan" of Townes and claimed to have all of his records; Van Zandt admired Dylan's songs, but didn't care for his celebrity.<ref name="deeperblue203" /> The two first met during a chance encounter outside a costume shop in the [[South Congress]] district of Austin, on June 21, 1986.<ref name="deeperblue203" /> According to Johnny Guess, Dylan later arranged another meeting with the songwriter. The [[Drag (Austin, Texas)|Drag]] in Austin was shut down due to Dylan being in town; Van Zandt drove his [[motorhome]] to the cordoned-off area, after which Dylan boarded the vehicle and requested to hear him play several songs.<ref>''[[Be Here to Love Me]]'' DVD bonus feature: Johnny Guess interview.</ref> In May and June 1990, he opened for the [[Cowboy Junkies]] during a two-month-long tour of the United States and Canada, which exposed him to a younger generation of fans.<ref name="tvzfaq" /> As a result, he wrote the song "Cowboy Junkies Lament" for the group, with a verse about each member of the band.<ref name="deeperblue216" />

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
Van Zandt married Fran Peterson on August 26, 1965; a son, John Townes "J.T." Van Zandt II, was born to them on April 11, 1969, in Houston. The couple divorced on January 16, 1970.<ref name="tvzfaq">{{Cite web |title=Townes Van Zandt - Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://pnwpest.org/coopl/tvzfaq.html |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=Oregon IPM Center}}</ref> He began dating [[Cindy Morgan]] in 1974 and they married in 1978. Van Zandt and Cindy became estranged for much of the early 1980s, and were divorced on February 10, 1983, in [[Travis County, Texas]]. They had no children.<ref name="tvzfaq" />

Van Zandt's third marriage was to Jeanene Munsell. They met on December 9, 1980, at a memorial for [[John Lennon]]. When Townes' terminally-ill mother learned that he had impregnated Munsell, she told him, "You're going to do the right thing and honor that baby."<ref name="deeperblue190">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=190}}</ref> He divorced his estranged second wife and married Munsell on March 14, 1983. Their first child, William Vincent, was born ten days later. Another child, Katie Belle, was born February 14, 1992. Van Zandt and Munsell divorced on May 2, 1994. However, the two remained close, and Jeanene was an executor of his estate.<ref name="tvzfaq" />

Around the time of their April 1993 separation,<ref name="deeperblue230" /> Jeanene coaxed the musician into signing over the publishing rights of his back catalog and recording royalties to her and their children.<ref name="deeperblue228">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=228}}</ref> Van Zandt's only source of income after making that change was money received from concert engagements<ref name="deeperblue229">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=229}}</ref> and, even then, Van Zandt frequently visited his ex-wife and gave her the money in his pockets.<ref name="deeperblue231">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=231}}</ref> Following their divorce in 1994, his only possessions were a 1989 [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck]] with [[camper shell]], a 1984 [[Honda Shadow]] motorcycle and a 1983 Starwind 22-foot boat named ''Dorothy.'' He also retained sole ownership of his family inheritance of ownership in oil lease and mineral rights.<ref name="deeperblue232">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=232}}</ref>

At the time of his death, he had begun a long-distance relationship with a woman named Claudia Winterer from [[Darmstadt]], Germany.<ref name="deeperblue241">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=241}}</ref> The two met in November 1995 during a concert of his in [[Hanau]], Germany. Van Zandt told friends, he planned on marrying Winterer,<ref name="deeperblue266">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=266}}</ref> but the two never became engaged.

=== Addiction ===
Van Zandt was addicted to [[heroin]] and alcohol throughout his adult life. At times, he became drunk on stage and forgot the lyrics to his songs. At one point, his heroin habit was so intense that he offered Kevin Eggers the publishing rights to all of the songs on each of his first four albums for $20.<ref name="chronicle">[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A94989 "Townes Without Pity: The Battle for Townes Van Zandt's legacy"], ''[[Austin Chronicle]]''; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> At various points, his friends saw him shoot up not just heroin, but also cocaine, vodka, as well as a mixture of rum and Coke.<ref name="deeperblue127-128">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|pp=127–128}}</ref> On at least one occasion, he shot up heroin in the presence of his son J.T., who was only eight years old at the time.<ref name="dallasmusic" />

As a result of Van Zandt's constant drinking, Harold Eggers, Kevin's brother, was hired as his tour manager and 24-hour caretaker in 1976, a partnership that lasted for the rest of the singer's life. Although the musician was years older than he was, Eggers later said that Van Zandt was his "first child."<ref name="chronicle" /> His battles with addiction led him into rehab nearly a dozen times throughout the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="deeperblue195">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=195}}</ref> Medical records from his recovery centers indicate that he believed his drinking had become a problem around 1973, and that by 1982 he was drinking at least a pint of vodka daily.<ref name="deeperblue195" /> Doctors' notes reported: "He admits to hearing voices, mostly musical voices", and "Affect is blunted and mood is sad. Judgment and insight is impaired."<ref name="deeperblue195" /> At various times he was prescribed the [[antidepressant]] [[Zoloft]] and the [[mood stabilizer]] [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]].<ref name="deeperblue230">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=230}}</ref><ref name="messages">Hedgepeth, William (May 1977).

=== Death ===
[[File:Townes Van Zandt.jpg|thumb|Townes Van Zandt at ''Kult'', Niederstetten (1995)]]
Van Zandt continued writing and performing through the 1990s, though his output slowed noticeably. He had enjoyed some sobriety during the early 1990s, but actively abused alcohol during his final years. In 1994, he was admitted to the hospital to [[Alcohol detoxification|detox]], when a doctor told Jeanene Van Zandt that trying to detox Townes again could potentially kill him.<ref name="texasmusic">[[KUT-FM]]'s Texas Music Matters: [http://townesvanzandt.com/TexasMusicMattersTVZSpecial.mp3 Townes Van Zandt Special] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911072142/http://townesvanzandt.com/TexasMusicMattersTVZSpecial.mp3 |date=September 11, 2008 }}, townesvanzandt.com; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> He grew increasingly frail during the mid-1990s, with friends noting that he seemed to have "withered."<ref name="deeperblue247">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=247}}</ref>

In early 1996, he was contacted by [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Steve Shelley]], who informed Van Zandt that he was interested in recording and releasing an album for him on the band's [[Ecstatic Peace]] label, funded by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]].<ref name="deeperblue245">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=245}}</ref> Van Zandt agreed, and sessions were scheduled to begin in Memphis during late December of that year. On December 19 or 20, Van Zandt fell down the concrete stairs outside his home, badly injuring his hip.<ref name="texasmusic" /><ref name="deeperblue255">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=255}}</ref> After lying outside for an hour, he dragged himself inside and called his ex-wife Jeanene, who sent friends Royann and Jim Calvin to check on him. He told the couple that he had sustained the injury while getting out of bed, and refused medical treatment. They took him back to their home, and he spent Christmas week on their couch, unable to get up even to use the bathroom.<ref name="deeperblue255" />

Determined to finish the album that he had scheduled to record with Shelley and Two Dollar Guitar, Van Zandt arrived at the Memphis studio being pushed in a wheelchair by road manager Harold Eggers. Shelley canceled the sessions due to the songwriter's erratic behavior and drunkenness. Van Zandt finally agreed to hospitalization, but not before returning to Nashville. By the time he consented to receive medical care, eight days had passed since the injury.<ref name="texasmusic" /> On December 31, X-rays revealed that Van Zandt had an impacted left [[Femur neck|femoral neck]] fracture in his hip, and several corrective surgeries were performed.<ref name="deeperblue260" /> Jeanene informed the surgeon that one of Townes's previous rehab doctors had told her detoxing could kill him.<ref name="texasmusic" /> The medical staff tried to explain to her that detoxing a "late-term alcoholic" at home would be ill-advised, and he would have a better chance at recovering under hospital supervision.<ref name="deeperblue260">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=260}}</ref> She did not heed the warnings, and checked Townes out of the hospital.<ref name="deeperblue261">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=261}}</ref> Understanding that he would most likely drink immediately after leaving the hospital, the physicians refused to prescribe him any [[painkiller]]s.<ref name="deeperblue262">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=262}}</ref>

By the time Van Zandt was checked out of the hospital early the next morning, he had begun to show signs of [[delirium tremens]].<ref name="texasmusic" /> Jeanene rushed him to her car, where she gave him a flask of vodka to ward off the withdrawal delirium. She later reported that after getting him back home to [[Smyrna, Tennessee]], and giving him alcohol, he became "lucid, in a real good mood, calling his friends on the phone."<ref name="texasmusic" /> Jim Calvin shared a marijuana joint with him,<ref name="deeperblue261" /> and he was also given about four [[Tylenol PM]] tablets.<ref name="deeperblue262" />

While Jeanene was on the phone with Susanna Clark, their son Will noticed that Townes had stopped breathing and "looked dead", and alerted his mother, who attempted to perform [[CPR]], "screaming his name between breaths".<ref name="texasmusic" /> Townes Van Zandt died in the early morning hours of January 1, 1997, at the age of 52. His official cause of death was "natural" [[cardiac arrhythmia]].<ref name="deeperblue264">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=264}}</ref>

Two services were held for Van Zandt: one in Texas for family, and another in a large Nashville church, attended by friends, acquaintances, and fans.<ref name="tm" /> Some of his ashes were placed underneath a headstone in the Van Zandt family plot at the Dido Cemetery in [[Dido, Texas]], near Fort Worth.<ref name="tm" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnwpest.org/coopl/tvzfaq.html#17|title=Townes Van Zandt – Frequently Asked Questions, No. 17|publisher=Pnwpest.org|access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref>

In the years immediately following Van Zandt's death, his former manager and label owner Kevin Eggers issued 14 albums of both new and previously unreleased material by the singer, all without consent of his estate (represented by Jeanene Van Zandt and his three children).<ref name=austinchronicle>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A616101 "For The Sake of the Song"]. ''Austin Chronicle''; accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> Eggers claimed a 50% interest in eighty of Van Zandt's songs. After nearly ten years of legal battles, the court sided with the estate, issuing "injunctive relief against Eggers, restraining him from reproducing or distributing any of Van Zandt's songs."<ref name=austinchronicle />

It was revealed through these proceedings that Van Zandt's annual income in the years before his death had climbed to over $100,000, thanks in large part to the royalties accrued from his songs being covered by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Merle Haggard, Cowboy Junkies, and other major music stars.<ref name=chronicle /> After Van Zandt's death his [[road manager]], Harold Eggers, released video and audio recordings from the songwriter's concerts.<ref name=austinchronicle /> An [[out-of-court settlement]] in 2006 granted the Van Zandts conditional control of Harold Eggers' mastered recordings with Eggers retaining a 50% ownership of seven albums and some royalties for the remaining recordings.<ref name=austinchronicle />

On October 21, 2008, a number of Van Zandt's personal possessions were auctioned off at The Northside in Akron, Ohio at a benefit for Rex "Wrecks" Bell. Bell was a close friend and bandmate, and the inspiration for the song "Rex's Blues". Bell was also part owner of the bar [[Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe|Old Quarter]] in Houston, where Van Zandt performed the songs that would comprise the album ''Live at the Old Quarter''.

'''Sir George Ivan Morrison''' {{small|[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]}}  (born 31 August 1945)<ref>{{AllMusic|tab=biography|title=Van Morrison biography}}</ref> is a singer-songwriter and musician from [[Northern Ireland]] whose recording career spans seven decades.

Morrison began performing as a teenager in the late 1950s, playing a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various [[Irish showband]]s, covering the popular hits of that time. Known as "Van the Man" to his fans,<ref>{{cite news|date=4 February 2016|title=Sir Van overjoyed at knighthood|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35494713|access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref> Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the [[Belfast]] [[R&B]] band [[Them (band)|Them]], with whom he wrote and recorded "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]", which became a [[garage band]] staple. His solo career started under the pop-hit oriented guidance of [[Bert Berns]] with the release of the hit single "[[Brown Eyed Girl]]" in 1967. 

After Berns's death, [[Warner Bros. Records]] bought Morrison's contract and allowed him three sessions to record ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' (1968).<ref>Turner (1993). pages 86&nbsp;– 90</ref> While initially a poor seller, the album has come to be regarded as a classic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0409fsg |title=Van Morrison: Astral Weeks |work=BBC Radio 6 Music |access-date=20 July 2021 }}</ref> ''[[Moondance]]'' (1970) established Morrison as a major artist,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_van_morrisons_moondance/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419192209/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_van_morrisons_moondance/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 April 2005|website=Mix (magazine)|title=Classic Tracks: Van Morrison's Moondance|date=1 April 2005|last=Eskow |first=Gary |access-date=26 May 2009}}</ref> and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances.

Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of [[soul music]] and early [[rhythm and blues]]. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and [[stream of consciousness]] narrative, such as the album ''Astral Weeks''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C333S|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607161658/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C333S|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 June 2011|title=SHOF: Van Morrison biography |publisher=Songwritersshalloffame.org|access-date=7 July 2008}}</ref><ref name="VF review">{{cite web|url=http://www.musthear.com/reviews/veedonfleece.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010530211144/http://musthear.com/reviews/veedonfleece.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 May 2001|author=Ballon, John|date=28 December 2008|title=Musthear review: Veedon Fleece |publisher=Musthear.com|access-date=18 May 2010}}</ref> The two strains together are sometimes referred to as "Celtic soul",<ref name="Astral Weeks, Light">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Astral_Weeks,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307081905/http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Astral_Weeks,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 March 2007|magazine=Time|date=13 November 2006|author=Light, Alan|title=The All-Time 100 Albums|access-date=6 May 2010}}</ref> and his music has been described as attaining "a kind of violent transcendence".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.soundstagexperience.com/index.php/music-movies-a-shows-menu/by-category/cd-music/913-van-morrison-the-healing-game-deluxe-edition |title=Van Morrison: "The Healing Game (Deluxe Edition)" |website=soundstageexperience.com |last=Hale |first=James |access-date=20 July 2021 }}</ref>

===Them: 1964–1966===
{{Main|Them (band)}}
The roots of Them, the band that first broke Morrison on the international scene, came in April 1964 when he responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] club at the Maritime Hotel in College Square North&nbsp;– an old Belfast hostel frequented by sailors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/ssvanmorrison.html|title=Van Morrison&nbsp;– In His Own Words|website=Superseventies.com|access-date=23 April 2009}}</ref><ref>[https://ulsterhistorycircle.org.uk/maritime-hotel/ 'The Maritime Hotel']. Ulster History Circle, 15 April 2015, retrieved 3 June 2022.</ref> The new club needed a band for its opening night. Morrison had left the Golden Eagles (the group with which he had been performing at the time), so he created a new band out of the Gamblers, an [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|East Belfast]] group formed by Ronnie Millings, Billy Harrison and Alan Henderson in 1962.<ref name="The rough guide">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haEfq-nKqjgC&q=The+Gamblers+van+morrison&pg=RA1-PA424|title=The rough guide to rock – Google Book Search|access-date=24 April 2009|last=Buckley|first=Peter|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|date=31 July 2002|publisher=Rough Guides }}</ref><ref name="The Belfast Blues">{{cite web|url=http://www.thembelfast.com/|title=THEM the Belfast Blues-Band|website=Thembelfast.com|access-date=24 April 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817111831/http://www.thembelfast.com/|archive-date=17 August 2009}}</ref> Eric Wrixon, still a schoolboy, was the piano player and keyboardist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/eric-wrixon/biography/1166048|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121129141027/http://music.aol.com/artist/eric-wrixon/biography/1166048|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 November 2012|title=Eric Wrixon Biography&nbsp;– AOL Music|website=Music.aol.com|access-date=24 April 2009}}</ref> Morrison played saxophone and harmonica and shared vocals with Billy Harrison. They followed Eric Wrixon's suggestion for a new name, and the Gamblers morphed into [[Them (band)|Them]], their name taken from the horror movie ''[[Them!]]''<ref>Rogan (2006), pp. 79–83</ref>

The band's R&B performances at the Maritime attracted attention. Them performed without a routine and Morrison [[ad lib]]bed, creating his songs live as he performed.<ref name="HintonPage40">Hinton (1997), page 40.</ref> While the band did covers, they also played some of Morrison's early songs, such as "Could You Would You", which he had written in [[Camden Town]] while touring with the Manhattan Showband.<ref>Rogan (2006), page 76</ref> The debut of Morrison's "Gloria" took place on stage here. Sometimes, depending on his mood, the song could last up to twenty minutes. Morrison has said, "Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel", believing the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records.<ref name="TurnerPage44">Turner (1993), page 44.</ref> The statement also reflected the instability of the Them line-up, with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive Maritime period. Morrison and Henderson remained the only constants, and a less successful version of Them soldiered on after Morrison's departure.<ref>Heylin (2003), page 118</ref>

[[Dick Rowe]] of [[Decca Records]] became aware of the band's performances, and signed Them to a standard two-year contract. In that period, they released two albums and ten singles, with two more singles released after Morrison departed the band. They had three [[record chart|chart]] hits, "[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]" (1964), "[[Here Comes the Night (Them song)|Here Comes the Night]]" (1965), and "[[Mystic Eyes]]" (1965),<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&q=Baby+Please+Don%27t+Go+/+Gloria&pg=PT1077|title=The rough guide to rock&nbsp;– Google Book Search|access-date=17 April 2009|last=Buckley|first=Peter|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides }}</ref> but it was the B-side of "Baby, Please Don't Go", the [[garage band]] classic "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]",<ref name="TurnerPage48-51">Turner (1993), pages 48–51</ref> that went on to become a rock standard covered by [[Patti Smith]], [[the Doors]], [[the Shadows of Knight]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t3122630|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|author=Janovitz, Bill|title=Gloria:Them:song review|access-date=21 May 2010}}</ref>

Building on the success of their singles in the United States, and riding on the back of the [[British Invasion]], Them undertook a two-month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Los Angeles.<ref name="TurnerPage65">Turner (1993), pages 65 – 66.</ref> [[The Doors]] were the supporting act on the last week,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Venues/whisky_them.html|author=Lawrence, Paul (2002)|title=The Doors and Them: twin Morrisons of different mothers|website=Waiting-forthe-sun.net|access-date=7 July 2008}}</ref> and Morrison's influence on the Doors singer [[Jim Morrison]] was noted by [[John Densmore]] in his book ''Riders on the Storm''. [[Brian Hinton]] relates how "Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks."<ref name="HintonPage67">Hinton (1997), page 67.</ref> On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on "Gloria".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|author=Arnold, Corry|date=23 January 2006|title=The History of the Whisky-A-Go-Go|website=Chickenonaunicyle.com|access-date=30 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323010118/http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|archive-date=23 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="VanM">{{cite web|url=http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html|title=Glossary entry for The Doors|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310195120/http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html|archive-date=10 March 2007}} from Van Morrison website.

Toward the end of the tour the band members became involved in a dispute with their manager, Decca Records' [[Phil Solomon (music executive)|Phil Solomon]], over the revenues paid to them; that, coupled with the expiry of their work visas, meant the band returned from America dejected. After two more concerts in Ireland, Them split up. Morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on ''Astral Weeks'', while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated in America.<ref name="TurnerPage72-73">Turner (1993), pages 72–73.</ref>

[[Bert Berns]], Them's producer and composer of their 1965 hit "Here Comes the Night", persuaded Morrison to return to New York to record solo for his new label, [[Bang Records]].<ref name="RoganPagep188">Rogan (2006), page 188.</ref> Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied.<ref>Heylin (2003), pages 144–147</ref> During a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967, he recorded eight songs, originally intended to be used as four singles.<ref>Turner (1993), page 76</ref> Instead, these songs were released as the album ''[[Blowin' Your Mind!]]'' without Morrison's consultation.

Over the next few years, he released a succession of albums, starting with a second one in 1970. ''[[His Band and the Street Choir]]'' had a freer, more relaxed sound than ''Moondance'', but not the ''perfection'', in the opinion of critic [[Jon Landau]], who felt like "a few more numbers with a gravity of 'Street Choir' would have made this album as perfect as anyone could have stood."<ref name="HBATSC">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21378|last=Landau|first=John|title=His Band and the Street Choir music review|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=4 February 1971|access-date=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212075624/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21378|archive-date=12 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> It contained the hit single "[[Domino (Van Morrison song)|Domino]]", which charted at number nine in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="CollisPage122">Collis (1996), page 122.</ref>

Released in 1972, ''[[Saint Dominic's Preview]]'' revealed Morrison's break from the more accessible style of his previous three albums and moving back towards the more daring, adventurous, and meditative aspects of ''Astral Weeks''. The combination of two styles of music demonstrated a versatility not previously found in his earlier albums.<ref name="Saint Dominic's Preview Music Review">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21052|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Saint Dominic's Preview Music Review|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=31 August 1972|access-date=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228224126/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/albums/album/186447/review/5945763|archive-date=28 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two songs, "[[Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)]]" and "[[Redwood Tree (song)|Redwood Tree]]", reached the Hot 100 singles chart.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> The songs "[[Listen to the Lion]]" and "[[Almost Independence Day]]" are each over ten minutes long and employ the type of poetic imagery not heard since ''Astral Weeks''.<ref name="Saint Dominic's Preview Music Review" /><ref name="HeylinPage255-256">Heylin (2003), pages 255–256.</ref> It was his highest-charting album in the US until his Top Ten debut on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in 2008.<ref name="Charts & Awards">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|title=Charts & Awards: Van Morrison|access-date=9 April 2009}}</ref>

He released his next album, ''[[Hard Nose the Highway]]'', in 1973, receiving mixed, but mostly negative, reviews.

Morrison took three years to release a follow-up album. After a decade without taking time off, he said in an interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months.<ref name="RoganPage306">Rogan (2006), page 306.</ref> Also suffering from [[writer's block]], he seriously considered leaving the music business for good.<ref name="HeylinPage305">Heylin (2003), page 305.</ref> Speculation that an extended [[jam session]] would be released either under the title ''Mechanical Bliss'', or ''Naked in the Jungle'', or ''Stiff Upper Lip'', came to nothing,<ref name="RoganPages304-306">Rogan (2006), pages 304–306.</ref> and Morrison's next album was ''[[A Period of Transition]]'' in 1977, a collaboration with [[Dr. John]], who had appeared at ''[[The Last Waltz]]'' concert with Morrison in 1976.

With his next album, the new decade found Morrison following his [[muse]] into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews.<ref name="HeylinPage364">Heylin (2003), page 364.</ref><ref name="RoganPage330">Rogan (2006), page 330.</ref> In February 1980, Morrison and a group of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the [[French Alps]], to record (on the site of a former [[abbey]]) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later "Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product."<ref name="HintonPage230">Hinton (1997), page 230.</ref><ref name="HeylinPage365">Heylin (2003), page 365.</ref> The album, ''[[Common One]]'', consisted of six songs; the longest, "[[Summertime in England]]", lasted fifteen and a half minutes and ended with the words ''"Can you feel the silence?"''. ''[[NME]]'' magazine's [[Paul Du Noyer]] called the album "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak."<ref name="HintonPage230" /> [[Greil Marcus]], whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be."<ref name="HeylinPage364" /> Morrison insisted the album was never "meant to be a commercial album."<ref name="HeylinPage364" /> Biographer [[Clinton Heylin]] concludes: "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality."<ref name="HeylinPage365" /> Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of "Summertime in England".<ref name="HeylinPage365" /> [[Lester Bangs]] wrote in 1982, "Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics."<ref name="HeylinPage364" />

Morrison's next album, ''[[Beautiful Vision]]'', released in 1982, had him returning once again to the music of his Northern Irish roots.<ref name="RoganPage338">Rogan (2006), page 338.</ref> Well received by the critics and public, it produced a minor UK hit single, "[[Cleaning Windows]]", that referenced one of Morrison's first jobs after leaving school.<ref name="RoganPage337-338">Rogan (2006), pages 337–338.</ref> Several other songs on the album, "[[Vanlose Stairway]]", "She Gives Me Religion", and the instrumental, "[[Scandinavia (composition)|Scandinavia]]" show the presence of a new personal muse in his life: a Danish public relations agent, who would share Morrison's spiritual interests and serve as a steadying influence on him throughout most of the 1980s.<ref name="HeylinPage371">Heylin (2003), page 371.</ref> "Scandinavia", with Morrison on piano,<ref name="Inarticulate Speech of the Heart">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21723|last=Fricke|first=David|title=Inarticulate Speech of the Heart Music Review|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=28 April 1983|access-date=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210033928/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21723|archive-date=10 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> was nominated in the ''Best Rock Instrumental Performance'' category for the 25th Annual [[Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1983/grammys.htm|title=Rock on the Net: 25th Annual Grammy Awards-1983|website=Rockonthenet.com|access-date=8 October 2009}}</ref>

Much of the music Morrison released throughout the 1980s continued to focus on the themes of [[spirituality]] and faith. His 1983 album, ''[[Inarticulate Speech of the Heart]]'', was "a move towards creating music for meditation" with synthesisers, uilleann pipes and flute sounds, and four of the tracks were instrumentals.<ref name="TurnerPage153">Turner (1993), page 153.</ref> The titling of the album and the presence of the instrumentals were noted to be indicative of Morrison's long-held belief that "it's not the words one uses but the force of conviction behind those words that matters."<ref name="Inarticulate Speech of the Heart" /> During this period of time, Morrison had studied [[Scientology]] and gave "Special Thanks" to [[L. Ron Hubbard]] on the album's credits.<ref name="TurnerPage150">Turner (1993), page 150</ref>

''[[A Sense of Wonder]]'', Morrison's 1985 album, pulled together the spiritual themes contained in his last four albums, which were defined in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review as: "rebirth (''Into the Music''), deep contemplation and meditation (''Common One''); ecstasy and humility (''Beautiful Vision''); and blissful, mantra like languor (''Inarticulate Speech of the Heart'')."<ref name="A Sense of Wonder">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21725|last=Puterbaugh|first=Parke|title=A Sense of Wonder Music Review|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=9 May 1985|access-date=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210035104/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21725|archive-date=10 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The single "[[Tore Down a la Rimbaud]]" was a reference to [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and an earlier bout of [[writer's block]] that Morrison had encountered in 1974.<ref name="HeylinPage308">Heylin (2003), page 308.</ref> In 1985, Morrison also wrote the musical score for the movie ''[[Lamb (1985 film)|Lamb]]'' starring [[Liam Neeson]].<ref name="CollisPage162">Collis (1996), page 162.</ref>

Morrison's 1986 release, ''[[No Guru, No Method, No Teacher]]'', was said to contain a "genuine holiness ... and musical freshness that needs to be set in context to understand."<ref name="HintonPage255">Hinton (1997), page 255.</ref> Critical response was favourable with a ''Sounds'' reviewer calling the album "his most intriguingly involved since ''Astral Weeks''" and "Morrison at his most mystical, magical best."<ref name="HeylinPage396">Heylin (2003), page 396.</ref><ref name="RoganPage360">Rogan (2006), page 360.</ref> It contains the song "[[In the Garden (Van Morrison song)|In the Garden]]" that, according to Morrison, had a "definite meditation process which is a 'form' of transcendental meditation as its basis. It's not TM".<ref name="HintonPage255" /> He entitled the album as a rebuttal to media attempts to place him in various creeds.<ref name="HintonPage253">Hinton (1997), page 253.</ref> In an interview in the Observer he told Anthony Denselow:

{{blockquote|There have been many lies put out about me and this finally states my position. I have never joined any organisation, nor plan to. I am not affiliated to any guru, don't subscribe to any method and for those people who don't know what a guru is, I don't have a teacher either.<ref name="HintonPage253-254">Hinton (1997), page 253-254.</ref>}}

After releasing the "No Guru" album, Morrison's music appeared less gritty and more [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] with the well-received 1987 album, ''[[Poetic Champions Compose]]'', considered to be one of his recording highlights of the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r13472|pure_url=yes}}|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|title=AllMusic review:Poetic Champions Compose|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=7 July 2008}}</ref> The romantic ballad from this album, "[[Someone Like You (Van Morrison song)|Someone Like You]]", has been featured subsequently in the soundtracks of several movies, including 1995's ''[[French Kiss (1995 film)|French Kiss]]'', and in 2001, both ''[[Someone like You (2001 film)|Someone Like You]]'' and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''.<ref name="Van Morrison at IMDb" /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/2001/04/05/bridget-jones-duels-someone-you-soundtrack/|author=Bonin, Liane|date=4 April 2001|title=Song Sung Blue|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=13 July 2008|archive-date=28 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528102633/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,104926,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1988, he released ''[[Irish Heartbeat]]'', a collection of traditional [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk songs]] recorded with the Irish group [[the Chieftains]], which reached number 18 in the UK album charts. The title song, "[[Irish Heartbeat (song)|Irish Heartbeat]]", was originally recorded on his 1983 album ''Inarticulate Speech of the Heart''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t877617|pure_url=yes}}|title=AllMusic: Irish Heartbeat|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=7 July 2008}}</ref>

The early to middle 1990s were commercially successful for Morrison with three albums reaching the top five of the UK charts, sold-out concerts, and a more visible public profile; but this period also marked a decline in the critical reception to his work.<ref name="HeylinPage450-458">Heylin (2003), pages 450–458.</ref> The decade began with the release of ''[[The Best of Van Morrison]]''; compiled by Morrison himself, the album was focused on his hit singles, and became a multi-platinum success remaining a year and a half on the UK charts.

In 2001, nine months into a tour with [[Linda Gail Lewis]] promoting their collaboration ''[[You Win Again (album)|You Win Again]]'', Lewis left the tour, later filing claims against Morrison for unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination.

He accepted a full apology and comprehensive retraction which represents a complete vindication of his stance from the outset.

==Live performances==
===1970s===
[[File:VanMorrison smiling.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Morrison performing at the Marin Civic Center, 2007.]]
By 1972, after being a performer for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing [[stage fright]] when performing for audiences of thousands, as opposed to the hundreds he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and had difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, "I dig singing the songs but there are times when it's pretty agonising for me to be out there." After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.<ref name="Rolling Stone Interview" />

On 21 July 1990, Morrison joined many other guests for [[Roger Waters]]' massive performance of ''[[The Wall – Live in Berlin]]''.

===1980s===
Morrison and the internationally renowned Irish folk band The Chieftains recorded the album ''[[Irish Heartbeat]]'' (1988). Consisting of Irish folk songs, it entered the UK Top 20.

===1990s===
The decade saw an upsurge in Van Morrison's collaborations. He developed a close association with two vocal talents at opposite ends of their careers: [[Georgie Fame]] (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent his voice and Hammond organ skills to Morrison's band; and [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]]'s vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances. He reunited with The Chieftains on their 1995 album, ''[[The Long Black Veil (album)|The Long Black Veil]]'', with a reworking of Morrison's song "[[Have I Told You Lately]]" winning the Grammy Award for [[Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/38th-annual-grammy-awards|title=38th Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=15 January 2013|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref> He produced, and was featured on, several tracks with blues legend John Lee Hooker on Hooker's 1997 album, ''[[Don't Look Back (John Lee Hooker album)|Don't Look Back]]''.

On this album, Hooker also recorded a cover of Morrison's "[[T.B.

| quote  = It is at the heart of Morrison's presence as a singer that when he lights on certain sounds, certain small moments inside a song—hesitations, silences, shifts in pressure, sudden entrances, slamming doors—can then suggest whole territories, completed stories, indistinct ceremonies, far outside anything that can be literally traced in the compositions that carry them.

Featuring his characteristic growl—a mix of [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[soul music|soul]], [[jazz]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] [[Celtic music|Celtic]] influences—Morrison is widely considered by many rock historians to be one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of [[rock and roll]].<ref name="Fallis, Jeff">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/08/van-morrison-between-the-heart-and-the-throat.html|magazine=[[Paste Magazine]]|title=Van Morrison: Between the Heart and the Throat|author=Fallis, Jeff|date=31 August 2015|access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref><ref name="Sheffield, Rob">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/duets-re-working-the-catalogue-114130/|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Duets: Re-Working the Cataloguet|author=Sheffield, Rob|date=24 March 2015|access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref><ref name="Van Morrison Biography: Rolling Stone">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622011927/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/biography|title=Van Morrison Biography: Rolling Stone|archive-date=22 June 2008|publisher=Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll (Simon and Shulster, 2001)|access-date=17 May 2010|url-status=dead|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/biography}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes}}|title=AllMusic: Van Morrison biography|author=Ankeny, Jason|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=6 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/van-morrison/|title=R&R Hall of Fame:Van Morrison|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=7 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604035945/http://rockhall.com/inductees/van-morrison/|archive-date=4 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Critic [[Greil Marcus]] has said "no white man sings like Van Morrison."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/reviews/music/van-morrison-still-on-top-greatest-hits-$1153228.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180359/http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/reviews/music/van-morrison-still-on-top-greatest-hits-%241153228.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date= 1 December 2008|title=Van Morrison: Still on Top – The Greatest Hits|author=Meghan, Graham|date=7 October 2007|website=Inthenews.co.uk|access-date=17 October 2008}}</ref> In his 2010 book, Marcus wrote, "As a physical fact, Morrison may have the richest and most expressive voice pop music has produced since [[Elvis Presley]], and with a sense of himself as an artist that Elvis was always denied."<ref>Marcus (2010), page 7</ref>

As Morrison began live performances of the 40-year-old album ''Astral Weeks'' in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as "flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive".<ref name="O'Hagan, Sean">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/02/vanmorrison-popandrock|work=The Guardian|author=O'Hagan, Sean|date=2 November 2008|title=Is this the best album ever made?|access-date=2 May 2009|location=London}}</ref> Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: "Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth—softer on the diction—but none the less impressively powerful."<ref name="McNulty, Bernadette">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/bernadettemcnulty/5245540/On-another-Astral-plane.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629212916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/bernadettemcnulty/5245540/On-another-Astral-plane.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=On Another Astral Plane|author=McNulty, Bernadette|date=29 April 2009|access-date=2 May 2009|location=London}}</ref> Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: "The approach now is to sing from lower down [the diaphragm] so I do not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly."<ref name="Astral Traveller">Neil, Chris, ''Performing Songwriter'', Issue 116, March/April 2009, Pages 44–50</ref>

===Songwriting and lyrics===
Morrison has written hundreds of songs<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1882001,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302082256/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1882001,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 March 2009|magazine=Time|title=10 Questions for Van Morrison|date=26 February 2009|access-date=6 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p107175|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|title=Van Morison songs|access-date=7 May 2009}}</ref> during his career with a recurring theme reflecting a nostalgic yearning for the carefree days of his childhood in Belfast.<ref name="Astral Travels">{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-02-18/music/the-astral-travels-of-van-morrison/|date=17 February 2009|website=The Village Voice|author=Foundas, Scott|title=The Astral Travels of Van Morrison|access-date=18 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222041219/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-02-18/music/the-astral-travels-of-van-morrison/|archive-date=22 February 2009}}</ref> Some of his song titles derive from familiar locations in his childhood, such as "[[Cyprus Avenue]]" (a nearby street), "[[Orangefield (song)|Orangefield]]" (the boys school he attended), and "On Hyndford Street" (where he was born). Also frequently present in Morrison's best love songs is a blending of the sacred-profane as evidenced in "[[Into the Mystic]]" and "So Quiet in Here".<ref name="HintonPage13">Hinton (1997), page 13.</ref><ref name="Enlightenment">{{cite magazine|magazine=Rolling Stone|title=Enlightenment: Van Morrison review|author=Swenson, John|date=15 November 1990}}</ref>

Beginning with his 1979 album, ''[[Into the Music]]'', and the song "[[And the Healing Has Begun]]", a frequent theme of his music and lyrics has been based on his belief in the healing power of music combined with a form of [[mysticism|mystic]] Christianity. This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.<ref name="CollisPage 149">Collis (1996), page 149.</ref>

His lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets [[William Blake]] and [[W. B. Yeats]]<ref name="HintonPage12">Hinton (1997), page 12.</ref> and others such as [[Samuel Coleridge|Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[William Wordsworth]].<ref name=TurnerPage145>Turner (1993), page 145</ref> Biographer [[Brian Hinton]] believes "like any great poet from Blake to [[Seamus Heaney]] he takes words back to their origins in magic ... Indeed, Morrison is returning poetry to its earliest roots—as in [[Homer]] or Old English epics like [[Beowulf]] or the Psalms or folk song—in all of which words and music combine to form a new reality."<ref name="HintonPage13" /> Another biographer, John Collis, believes Morrison's style of jazz singing and repeating phrases preclude his lyrics from being regarded as poetry or as Collis asserts: "he is more likely to repeat a phrase like a mantra, or burst into scat singing. The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry."<ref name="CollisPage12">Collis (1996), page 10.</ref>

Morrison has described his songwriting method by remarking: "I write from a different place. I do not even know what it is called or if it has a name. It just comes and I sculpt it, but it is also a lot of hard work doing the sculpting."<ref name="Astral Traveller" />

===Performance style===
{{quote box
| width  = 30%
| align  = right
| quote=Van Morrison is interested, ''obsessed'' with how much musical or verbal information he can compress into a small space, and, almost, conversely, how far he can spread one note, word, sound, or picture. To capture one moment, be it a caress or a twitch. He repeats certain phrases to extremes that from anybody else would seem ridiculous, because he's waiting for a vision to unfold, trying as unobtrusively as possible to nudge it along ... It's the great search, fuelled by the belief that through these musical and mental processes illumination is attainable. Or may at least be glimpsed.

Critic [[Greil Marcus]] argues that, given the truly distinctive breadth and complexity of Morrison's work, it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others: "Morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock & roll, a singer who cannot be pinned down, dismissed, or fitted into anyone's expectations."<ref name="MarcusPage447">Marcus (1992), page 447.</ref> Or in the words of [[Jay Cocks]]: "He extends himself only to express himself. Alone among rock's great figures—and even in that company he is one of the greatest—Morrison is adamantly inward. And unique. Although he freely crosses musical boundaries— [[R&B]], Celtic melodies, jazz, rave-up rock, hymns, down-and-dirty blues—he can unfailingly be found in the same strange place: on his own wavelength."<ref name="Listen to the Lion">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974140-1,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628235837/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974140-1,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2011|title=Listen to the Lion|magazine=Time|author=Cocks, Jay|date=28 October 1991|access-date=12 January 2009}}</ref>

His spiritually themed style of music first came into full expression with ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' in 1968 and he was noted to have remained a "master of his [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] craft" in 2009 while performing the ''Astral Weeks'' songs live.<ref name="HPMR">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/huffpost-reviews-van-morr_b_161308.html|title=HuffPost Reviews:Van Morrison—Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl|last=Rogogna|first=Mike|date=27 January 2009|newspaper=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="RSAWL">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/astral-weeks-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl-20090204|title=Van Morrison: Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl|author=Fricke, David|date=4 February 2009|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=10 November 2011|archive-date=31 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531091846/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/astral-weeks-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl-20090204|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2008/11/live-review-van.html|author=Lewis, Randy|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=9 November 2009|title=Live review: Van Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="LATIMES">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-morrison9-2009jan09,0,5414358.story|title=Van Morrison takes listeners on his spiritual journey|work=Los Angeles Times|date=9 January 2009|author=Lewis, Randy|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref> This musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry. His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity. Scott Foundas with ''[[LA Weekly]]'' wrote "he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song; to achieve a total freedom of form; to take himself, his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known."<ref name="Astral Travels" /><ref name="foundas">{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-14/columns/van-morrison-goes-astral-on-the-tonight-show/|title=Van Morrison Goes Astral on The Tonight Show|date=13 May 2009|work=[[LA Weekly]]|last=Foundas|first=Scott|access-date=18 December 2009|archive-date=1 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101142926/http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-14/columns/van-morrison-goes-astral-on-the-tonight-show|url-status=dead}}</ref> Greil Marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in Morrison's music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains: "But in his music the same sense of escape from ordinary limits—a reach for, or the achievement of, a kind of violent transcendence—can come from hesitations, repetitions of words or phrases, pauses, the way a musical change by another musician is turned by Morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself. In these moments, the self is left behind, and the sound, that "yarragh," becomes the active agent: a musical person, with its own mind, its own body."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/05/listening-van-morrison-greil-marcus|title=Listening to Van Morrison by Greil Marcus|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|last=Marcus|first=Greil|date=4 June 2010|access-date=21 August 2012}}</ref> A book reviewer further described it as "This transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two, neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one, like breath and life ..."<ref name="MWM">{{cite web|url=http://www.muddywatermagazine.com/When-That-Rough-God-Goes-Riding-Review-by-Will-Brennan.html|title=When That Rough God Goes Riding:Book Review-Greil Marcus|author=Brennan, Will|date=25 April 2010|work=Muddy Water Magazine|access-date=19 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121215837/http://www.muddywatermagazine.com/When-That-Rough-God-Goes-Riding-Review-by-Will-Brennan.html|archive-date=21 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Genre===
The music of Van Morrison has encompassed many genres since his early days as a [[blues]] and [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer in Belfast. Over the years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests. As well as blues and R&B, his compositions and [[cover versions|covers]] have moved between pop music, [[jazz]], rock, [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] and [[Irish traditional music|traditional]], [[big band]], [[skiffle]], [[rock and roll]], [[New-age music|new age]], classical and sometimes [[spoken word]] ("[[Coney Island (Van Morrison song)|Coney Island]]") and [[instrumental]]s.<ref name="HintonPage15">Hinton (1997), page 15.</ref> Morrison defines himself as a soul singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mvremix.com/rock_blogs/2009/01/08/van-morrisons-astral-weeks-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl-chronicles-the-first-ever-live-performance-of-legendary-soul-singers-revered-1968-album/|website=Mvremix.com|date=8 January 2009|title=Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl"|access-date=29 May 2009}}</ref>

Morrison's music has been described by music journalist [[Alan Light]] as "Celtic soul",<ref name="Astral Weeks, Light" /> or what biographer Brian Hinton referred to as a new alchemy called "Caledonian soul."<ref name="HintonPage13" /> Another biographer, [[Ritchie Yorke]] quoted Morrison as believing that he has "the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it."<ref name="Yorke Page159">Yorke (1975), page 159.</ref> According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered "a certain quality of soul" when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke said Morrison "discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by [[bagpipes|bagpipe]] players and old Irish and Scottish folk music."<ref name="Yorke Page159" />

==='Caledonia' theme===
The name "[[Caledonia]]" has played a prominent role in Morrison's life and career. Biographer [[Ritchie Yorke]] had pointed out already by 1975 that Morrison has referred to Caledonia so many times in his career that he "seems to be obsessed with the word".<ref name="Yorke Page159" /> In his 2009 biography, Erik Hage found "Morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal Scottish roots during his early career, and later in the ancient countryside of England, hence his repeated use of the term ''Caledonia'' (an ancient Roman name for Scotland/northern Britain)".<ref>Hage (2009), page 52</ref> As well as being his daughter [[Shana Morrison|Shana]]'s middle name, it is the name of his first production company, his studio, his publishing company, two of his backing groups, his parents' record store in Fairfax, California in the 1970s, and he also recorded a cover of the song "[[Caldonia]]" (with the name spelled "Caledonia") in 1974.<ref name="Yorke Page159" /><ref>Collis (1996), page134"</ref> Morrison used "Caledonia" in what has been called a quintessential Van Morrison moment in the song, "[[Listen to the Lion]]" with the lyrics, "And we sail, and we sail, way up to Caledonia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2005/11/listening-to-old-voices-van-morrison.html|website=Paste|author=Whitman, Andy|title=Listening to Old Voices: Van Morrison The Lion In Winter|date=14 November 2005|access-date=17 January 2009}}</ref> Morrison used "Caledonia" as a [[mantra]] in the live performance of the song "[[Astral Weeks (song)|Astral Weeks]]" recorded at the two [[Hollywood Bowl]] concerts.<ref name="latimes9Jan" /> As late as 2016's ''[[Keep Me Singing]]'' album, he recorded a self-penned instrumental entitled "Caledonia Swing."

===Influence===
Morrison's influence can readily be heard in the music of a diverse array of major artists. According to ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll'' (Simon & Schuster, 2001), "his influence among rock singers/song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend, [[Bob Dylan]]. Echoes of Morrison's rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from [[Bruce Springsteen]] to [[Elvis Costello]]".<ref name="Van Morrison Biography: Rolling Stone" /> He has influenced an array of top tier performers, including [[U2]], with [[Bono]] recalling, "I am in awe of a musician like Van Morrison. I had to stop listening to Van Morrison records about six months before we made ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' because I didn't want his very original soul voice to overpower my own".<ref>Bayles, Martha.

Morrison met Irish socialite [[Michelle Rocca]] in the summer of 1992, and they often featured in the Dublin gossip columns, an unusual event for the reclusive Morrison.

In December 2009, Morrison's tour manager Gigi Lee gave birth to a son, who she asserted was Morrison's and named after him. Lee announced the birth of the child on Morrison's official website, but Morrison denied paternity. Lee's son died in January 2011 from complications of [[diabetes]], and Lee died soon after from throat cancer in October 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/gigi-lees-baby-died-after-slipping-into-diabetic-coma-2977310.html|title=Gigi Lee's baby died after slipping into diabetic coma|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=2 January 2012|last=McKeown|first=Lesley-Anne|access-date=3 January 2012}}</ref>

===Religion and spirituality===
Morrison and his family have been affiliated with St Donard's Parish Church, an [[Anglican]] congregation of the [[Church of Ireland]] located in east Belfast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://suncoastvanfans.blogspot.com/2012/04/religious-affiliation-of-van-morrison.html|title=Sunshine Coast Van Fans: The Religious Affiliation of Van Morrison|last=Kazooboy|date=29 June 2011|website=Suncoastvanfans.blogspot.com|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref> During [[the Troubles]], the area was described as "militantly [[Protestant]]", although Morrison's parents have always been freethinkers, with his father openly declaring himself an [[atheist]] and his mother being connected to [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] at one point.<ref>Listening to Van Morrison by Greil Marcus, Introduction p. 1</ref> Van Morrison was linked to [[Scientology]] for a short time and even thanked its founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]], in one of his songs.<ref name="BTS"/> Later, he became wary of religion, saying: "I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole." He also said it is important to distinguish [[spirituality]] from religion: "Spirituality is one thing, religion ... can mean anything from soup to nuts, you know? But it generally means an organisation, so I don't really like to use the word, because that's what it really means. It really means this church or that church ... but spirituality is different, because that's the individual."<ref name="BTS">{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/van-morrison-has-religious-experience-during-la-service-35867612.html|title=Van Morrison has religious experience during LA service|access-date=8 December 2018|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph}}</ref>

===The Troubles===
Morrison left Northern Ireland before [[The Troubles]] started and distanced himself from the conflict, although later "yearned for" Protestant and Catholic reconciliation.<ref>''The Words and Music of Van Morrison'', Erik Hage, p. 6.</ref> In 1972, he gave an interview with the Dublin-based magazine ''Spotlight'', in which he said, "I'm definitely Irish ... I don't think I want to go back to Belfast. I don't miss it with all the prejudice around. We're all the same and I think it's terrible what's happening. But I'd like to get a house in Ireland ... I'd like to spend a few months there every year."<ref>Johnny Rogan, ''Van Morrison: No Surrender'' (London: Secker & Warburg, 2005), p. 273.</ref>

'''Willie Hugh Nelson''' (born April 29, 1933) is an American [[Country music|country]] singer, guitarist and songwriter. He was one of the main figures of the [[outlaw country]] subgenre that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. The critical success of his album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalization of marijuana]].

Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a [[disc jockey]] at radio stations in his native Texas, and at several radio stations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]", "[[Hello Walls]]", "[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]", and "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].

In 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]", "[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]", and "[[Pancho and Lefty]]", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. In 1985, he helped organize the first [[Farm Aid]] concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.

In 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.

Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the [[biodiesel]] brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.

Nelson was born in [[Abbott, Texas]], on April 29, 1933,{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=13}} the son of Ira Doyle Nelson and Myrle Marie (''née'' Greenhaw).{{sfn|Scobey|1982|p=58}} His birthday was incorrectly recorded by Dr. F. D. Sims as April 30.{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=13}} He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother.{{sfn|Patoski|p=13|2008}} Nelson traces his genealogy to the [[American Revolutionary War]], in which his ancestor John Nelson served as a major.{{sfn|Hunt|2009}} His parents moved to Texas from [[Arkansas]] in 1929 to look for work. His grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic.{{sfn|Nelson|2007a|p=29}} His mother left soon after he was born,{{sfn|Laufenberg|p=473|2005}} and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Nelson and his sister [[Bobbie Nelson|Bobbie]] to be raised by their grandparents, who taught singing back in Arkansas and started their grandchildren in music.{{sfn|Patoski|p=6|2008}}{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=218}} 218]}} Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few [[Guitar chord|chords]],{{sfn|Nelson|2007a|p=29}} and Nelson sang gospel songs in the local church alongside Bobbie.{{sfn|Malone|2002|p=303}} He wrote his first song at age seven,{{sfn|Patoski|2008}} and when he was nine, he played guitar for local band Bohemian Polka.{{sfn|Kienzle|p=236|2003}} During the summer, the family [[Cotton picking|picked cotton]] alongside other Abbott residents.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|pp=[{{google books|plainurl=y|ZqZ4PgAACAAJ|page=7}} 7, 8, 23]}} Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and [[Honky-tonk|honky tonks]] from age 13, which he continued through high school.{{sfn|Scobey|1982|p=47}} His musical influences were [[Jimmie Rodgers]],  [[Hank Williams]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Louis Armstrong]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nashvillemusicguide.com/willie-nelson-and-merle-haggard-sing-about-influences-and-friendship-on-django-and-jimmie-cd/ | title=Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard Sing About Influences and Friendship on "Django and Jimmie" CD | date=July 12, 2015 }}</ref>{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZqZ4PgAACAAJ|page=17}} 17]}}{{sfn|Hann|2012}}

Nelson attended [[Abbott High School]], where he was a halfback on the [[American football|football]] team, guard on the [[basketball]] team, and [[shortstop]] in [[baseball]]. He also raised [[pig]]s with the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]].{{sfn|Scobey|1982|p=58}} While still at school, he sang and played guitar in The Texans, a band formed by his sister's husband, Bud Fletcher.{{sfn|Kienzle|p=236|2003}} The band played in [[honky-tonk]]s, and also had a Sunday morning spot at [[KHBR (AM)|KHBR]] in [[Hillsboro, Texas]]. Meanwhile, Nelson had a short stint as a relief phone operator in Abbott, followed by a job as a [[tree care|tree trimmer]] for the local electric company, as well as a [[pawn shop]] employee.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} After leaving school in 1950, he joined the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]; he served for nine months before being medically discharged because of issues with his back.{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=392}} Upon his return in 1952, he married Martha Matthews, and from 1954 to 1956 studied agriculture at [[Baylor University]], where he joined the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, until dropping out to pursue a career in music.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=24}} He worked as a nightclub bouncer, autohouse partsman, saddle maker, and tree trimmer again. He later joined [[Johnny Bush]]'s band.

Nelson moved with his family to [[Pleasanton, Texas]], where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at [[KWMF|KBOP]]. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: "[[The Storm Has Just Begun]]" and "When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song". He recorded the tracks on used tapes, and sent the demos to the local label SARG Records, which rejected them.{{sfn|Thomson|p=24|2012}} He then had stints working for KDNT in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], [[KAMM (AM)|KCUL]], and [[KFJZ|KCNC]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], where he hosted ''[[The Western Express]]'', taught Sunday school, and played in nightclubs. He then decided to move to [[San Diego]] but, when he was unable to find a job there, he hitchhiked to [[Portland, Oregon]], where his mother lived.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} When nobody picked him up, he ended up sleeping in a ditch{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=92}} before hopping a [[Rail freight transport|freight train]] bound for [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. A truck driver drove him to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=93}}

==Music career==
===Beginnings (1956–1971)===
Nelson was hired by [[KVAN (AM)|KVAN]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], and appeared frequently on a television show.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}}{{sfn|Patoski|pp=74–76|2008|}} He made his first record in 1956, "[[No Place for Me]]", that included [[Leon Payne]]'s "Lumberjack" on the B-side.{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=70}} The recording failed.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=246}} 246]}} Nelson continued working as a radio announcer and singing in Vancouver clubs.{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}}
He made several appearances in a Colorado nightclub, later moving to [[Springfield, Missouri]]. After failing to land a spot on the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', he started to work as a dishwasher. Unhappy with his job, he moved back to Texas. After a short time in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], he settled in Fort Worth, and quit the music business for a year.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} He sold bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door,{{sfn|Dingus|1992|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZysEAAAAMBAJ|77|page=77}} 77]}} and eventually became a sales manager for the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=5}}

After his son Billy was born in 1958, the family moved to [[Houston]], Texas. On the way, Nelson stopped by the [[Esquire Ballroom]] to sell his original songs to house band singer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]. Butler refused to purchase the song "[[Mr. Record Man]]" for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=116, 117}} Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in [[Pasadena, Texas]], where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey. During this time, he recorded two singles for [[Pappy Daily]] on [[D Records]]{{sfn|Smith|2013}} "[[Man With the Blues]]"/"The Storm Has Just Begun" and "[[What a Way to Live (song)|What a Way to Live]]"/"Misery Mansion".{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=117}} Nelson then was hired by guitar instructor Paul Buskirk to work as an instructor in his school. He sold "[[Family Bible (song)|Family Bible]]" to Buskirk for $50 and "[[Night Life (Willie Nelson song)|Night Life]]" for $150.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=118}} "Family Bible" turned into a hit for [[Claude Gray]] in 1960.{{sfn|Patoski|p=102|2008}}

{{Listen |type=music |filename=Hello Walls.ogg|title="Hello Walls" |description=Written by Willie Nelson, "Hello Walls", was a hit for Faron Young in 1961, and the song that gave Nelson national recognition as a songwriter. He recorded the song for his debut album ''...&nbsp;And Then I Wrote''.}}

Nelson moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1960, but was unable to find a label to sign him. During this period he often spent time at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=36}} There Nelson met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with [[Buddy Emmons]] and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing "Hello Walls" at Tootsie's, [[Faron Young]] decided to record it.{{sfn|Kosser|2006|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=DL6gHNXWToQC|page=73}} 73]}} After Ray Price recorded Nelson's "Night Life", and his previous bassist [[Johnny Paycheck]] quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the [[Cherokee Cowboys]], his songs became hits for other artists, including "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), "[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]" by [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}} Nelson and Cochran also met Cline's husband, [[Charlie Dick]] at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of Nelson's he heard on the bar's jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of "Crazy". Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=6}} "Crazy" became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}}

[[File:Willie Nelson Grand Ole Opry publicity - cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Nelson performing on a [[Grand Ole Opry]] package show in 1965]]
Nelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at the [[Bradley Studios]] in Nashville. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including "[[Willingly]]" (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]], which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.&nbsp;10) and "[[Touch Me (Willie Nelson song)|Touch Me]]" (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.&nbsp;7).{{sfn|Edwards|Callahan|2001}} Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]'', released in September 1962.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|p=79}} In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in [[Las Vegas]]. He then worked on the west coast offices of Pamper Records, in [[Pico Rivera, California]]. Since the job did not allow him the time to play music of his own, he left it and bought a ranch in [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside of Nashville.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=5}} [[Fred Foster]] of [[Monument Records]] signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released: "I Never Cared For You".{{sfn|Scobey|p=190|1982}}

By the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to [[RCA Victor]] at the behest of [[Chet Atkins]], signing a contract for $10,000 per year.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}} 224]}} ''[[Country Willie – His Own Songs]]'' became Nelson's first RCA Victor album, recorded in April 1965. That same year he joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]],{{sfn|Patoski|p=Nashville, 1960|2008|}} and he met and became friends with [[Waylon Jennings]] after watching one of his shows in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=158}} In 1967, he formed his backing band "The Record Men", featuring Johnny Bush, [[Jimmy Day]], [[Paul English (drummer)|Paul English]] and David Zettner.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|pp=137–138}} During his first few years on RCA Victor, Nelson had no significant hits, but from November 1966 through March 1969, his singles reached the Top 25 in a consistent manner. "One in a Row" (#19, 1966), "The Party's Over" (#24 during a 16-week chart run in 1967), and his cover of [[Morecambe & Wise]]'s "Bring Me Sunshine" (#13, March 1969) were Nelson's best-selling records during his time with RCA.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=246}} 246]}}

By 1970, most of Nelson's songwriting royalties were invested in tours that did not produce significant profits. In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near [[Bandera, Texas]], and married Connie Koepke. In early 1971 his single "I'm a Memory" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Kienzle|2003|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=Gq2TTa6TStkC|page=248}} 248]}} After he recorded his final RCA single, "Mountain Dew" (backed with "Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes"), in late April 1972, RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Due to the failure of his albums, and particularly frustrated by the reception of ''[[Yesterday's Wine]]'', although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire from music.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=167}}

===Outlaw country and success (1972–1989)===
Nelson moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where the burgeoning hippie music scene (see [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]) rejuvenated the singer. His popularity in Austin soared as he played his own brand of country music marked by country, folk and jazz influences.{{sfn|Reid|Sahm|2010|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=1gry61absiEC|page=79}} 79]}} In March, he performed on the final day of the ''Dripping Springs Reunion'', a three-day country music festival aimed by its producers to be an annual event. Despite the failure to reach the expected attendance, the concept of the festival inspired Nelson to create the ''[[Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic|Fourth of July Picnic]]'', his own annual event, starting the following year.{{sfn|Thomas|2012}}

Nelson decided to return to the recording business; he signed Neil Reshen as his manager to negotiate with RCA, who got the label to agree to end his contract upon repayment of $14,000.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Reshen eventually signed Nelson to [[Atlantic Records]] for $25,000 per year, where he became the label's first country artist.{{sfn|Reid|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}}]}} He formed his backing band, ''[[Family (Willie Nelson's band)|The Family]]'',{{sfn|Milner|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=zeslYkOZIvUC|page=183}} 183], [{{google books|plainurl=y|id=zeslYkOZIvUC|184|page=184}} 184]|1998}} and, by February 1973, he was recording his acclaimed ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' at Atlantic Studios in New York City.{{sfn|Harden|Hoekstra|McCall|Morris|1996|p=169}}

{{Listen |type=music |filename=Shotgun Willie.ogg|title="Shotgun Willie introduction" |description=Introduction of the song "Shotgun Willie", opening track of the album of the [[Shotgun Willie|same name]] that marked a change of style from Nelson's earlier recordings.}}
''Shotgun Willie'', released in May 1973, earned excellent reviews but did not sell well. The album led Nelson to a new style, later stating that ''Shotgun Willie'' had "cleared his throat".{{sfn|Tichi|1998|p=341}} His next release, ''[[Phases and Stages]]'', released in 1974, was a concept album about a couple's divorce, inspired by his own experience. Side one of the record is from the viewpoint of the woman, and side two is from the viewpoint of the man.{{sfn|Erlewine|2007}} The album included the hit single "[[Bloody Mary Morning]]".{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=247}} 247]}} The same year, he produced and starred in the pilot episode of [[PBS]]' ''[[Austin City Limits]]''.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=75}}

Nelson then moved to [[Columbia Records]], where he signed a contract that gave him complete creative control, made possible by the critical and commercial success of his previous albums.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|247|page=247}} 247]}} The result was the critically acclaimed and massively popular 1975 concept album ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]''. Although Columbia was reluctant to release an album with primarily a guitar and piano for accompaniment, Nelson and Waylon Jennings insisted. The album included a cover of [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]]'s 1945 song "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]", that had been released as a single previous to the album, and became Nelson's first number one hit as a singer.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=3Jorozp1yp4C|page=367}} 367]}} Throughout his 1975 tour, Nelson raised funds for PBS-affiliated stations across the south promoting ''Austin City Limits''. The pilot was aired first on those stations, later being released nationwide. The positive reception of the show prompted PBS to order ten episodes for 1976, formally launching the show.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=76}}

As Jennings was also achieving success in country music in the early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called [[outlaw country]], since it did not conform to Nashville standards.{{sfn|Hartman|2008|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=d3vlqWvTDfgC|174|page=174}} 174]}} The album ''[[Wanted!

In the summer of 1977, Nelson discovered that Reshen had been filing tax extensions and not paying the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) since he took over as his manager.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=263}} In June, a package containing cocaine was sent from Reshen's office in New York to Jennings in Nashville.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=262}} The package was followed by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], and Jennings was arrested. The charges were later dropped, since Reshen's assistant, Mark Rothbaum, stepped in and took the charges. Rothbaum was sentenced to serve time in jail. Impressed by his attitude, Nelson fired Reshen and hired Rothbaum as his manager.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=263}} In 1978, Nelson released two more platinum albums. One, ''[[Waylon & Willie]]'', was a collaboration with Jennings that included "[[Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]", a hit single written and performed by [[Ed Bruce]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|p=10|1996}} Though observers predicted that ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' would ruin his career, it went platinum the same year.{{sfn|RIAA staff 3|2010}} Nelson continued to top the charts with hit songs during the late 1970s, including "[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]", "Remember Me",{{sfn|Billboard|1976}} "[[If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time]]", and "[[Uncloudy Day]]".{{sfn|Tribe|2006|p=188}}

Nelson, who was unaware of [[Elvis Presley]]'s version of the song, asked him to record it. Produced by Moman, the single of the song was released, as well as the album of the same name. The single topped ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot Country Singles, while it reached number five on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

In 2002, Nelson became the official spokesman of the [[Texas Roadhouse]], a chain of steakhouses. Nelson heavily promoted the chain and appeared on a special on [[Food Network]]. The chain installed ''Willie's Corner'', a section dedicated to him and decked out with Willie memorabilia, at several locations.{{sfn|Carey|2003}} In 2004, Nelson and his wife Annie became partners with Bob and Kelly King in the building of two Pacific Bio-diesel plants, one in [[Salem, Oregon]], and the other at Carl's Corner, Texas (the Texas plant was founded by Carl Cornelius, a longtime Nelson friend and the eponym for Carl's Corner). In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]] ("Bio-Willie"), a company that was marketing bio-diesel bio-fuel to truck stops.{{sfn|SmithTaylor|2008|p=173}} The fuel was made from vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil), and can be burned without modification in [[diesel engine]]s.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2005}} Nelson registered his company with Earth Biofuels and he became a board member. In 2007, Nelson forfeited six million shares of the company as he left the board.{{sfn|Brick, Michael|2014}} By 2008, he reopened [[Willie's Place]], a truck stop in [[Carl's Corner, Texas]]. The [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] allowed Nelson to invest in it. The establishment had about 80 employees,{{sfn|Dunn|2011}} and was used as a concert hall with a bar and a {{convert|1000|sqft}} dance floor.{{sfn|Willie's Place staff|2010}} Willie's Place also featured BioWillie pumps. At the time, the government of the United States offered a one dollar tax credit to producers of biodiesel. As the competition grew, the tax credit was discontinued while the prices of fossil fuels continued to drop. Nelson and his partners defaulted the $4,75 million loan they took for the construction of Willie's Place. Nelson then paid $35,000 back, while a judge later rejected the request of his creditors to receive more money from him. [[TravelCenters of America]] bought Willie's Place during its foreclosure in 2011. The BioWillie plant was then put on the market for sale. Nelson kept the trademark for BioWillie, which is sold in the islands of Maui and Hawaii. Meanwhile, Nelson owns shares of Big Island Biodiesel in Hawaii and SeQuential-Pacific Biodiesel in Oregon.{{sfn|Brick, Michael|2014}}

In 2010, Nelson founded with the collaboration of producers and filmmakers [[Luck Films]], a company dedicated to produce feature films, documentaries and concerts.{{sfn|Chagollan|2010}} The next year, he created the [[Willie's Roadhouse]] show which aired on channel 56 of [[SiriusXM]] radio. The channel was a result of the merger of his two other channels ''The Roadhouse'' and ''Willie's Place''.{{sfn|Opry.com staff|2011}} In November 2014, it was announced that Nelson would be the host of the television series ''Inside Arlyn'', shot at Arlyn Studio in Austin, Texas. The thirteen-episode first season would feature artists being interviewed by Nelson and [[Dan Rather]], followed by a performance. The series concept received attention from cable channels that requested to see the pilot episode.{{sfn|Swiatecki|2014}} Following the legalization of marijuana in different states, Nelson announced in 2015 through spokesman Michael Bowman the establishment of his own marijuana brand, [[Willie's Reserve]]. Plans to open chain stores in the states where marijuana was legalized were announced, to be expanded state-to-state if marijuana legalization is further expanded. Bowman called the brand "a culmination of (Nelson's) vision, and his whole life".{{sfn|Guardian Music staff|2015}}

In 2017, Nelson appeared as himself in [[Woody Harrelson]]'s live film, ''[[Lost in London]]''.{{sfn|Lodderhose|2016}} In June 2017, he appeared alongside Merle Haggard in the documentary ''[[The American Epic Sessions]]'' directed by [[Bernard MacMahon (filmmaker)|Bernard MacMahon]]. They performed a song Haggard had composed for the film, "The Only Man Wilder Than Me",{{sfn|Solomon|2017}}{{sfn|Hautzinger|2017}} and [[Bob Wills]]'s classic "Old Fashioned Love",{{sfn|Hautzinger|2017}} which they recorded live direct to disc on the first [[History of sound recording#The electrical era (1925 to 1945) (including sound on film)|electrical sound recording]] system from the 1920s.{{sfn|Locke|2017}} It was the last filmed performance of the pair. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that "in the final performance of Sessions, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard perform the duet 'The Only Man Wilder Than Me.' Haggard has a look of complete joy on his face throughout the session in the old-timey recording setup once used by his musical heroes."{{sfn|Appleford|2017}}

==Music style==
Nelson uses a variety of music styles to create his own distinctive blend of country music, a hybrid of jazz, pop, blues, rock and folk.{{sfn|Erlewine|2015}} His "unique sound", which uses a "relaxed, behind-the-beat singing style and gut-string guitar"{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica staff|2011}} and his "nasal voice and jazzy, off-center phrasing",{{sfn|Erlewine|2015}} has been responsible for his wide appeal, and has made him a "vital icon in country music", influencing the "[[Country music|new country]], [[Neotraditional country|new traditionalist]], and [[alternative country]] movements of the 1980s and 1990s".{{sfn|Erlewine|2015}}

In 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an amplifier and guitar with their "Prismatone" [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]. During a show in [[Helotes, Texas]], Nelson left the guitar on the floor of the stage, and it was later stepped on by a drunk man.{{sfn|Nelson|2005}}
He sent it to be repaired in Nashville by [[Shot Jackson]], who told Nelson that the damage was too great. Jackson offered him a [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] N-20 [[classical guitar]], and, at Nelson's request, moved the pickup to the Martin. Nelson purchased the guitar unseen for $750 and named it after [[Roy Rogers]]' horse [[Trigger (horse)|"Trigger"]].{{sfn|Willie Nelson General Store staff|2010}} The next year Nelson rescued the guitar from his burning ranch.{{sfn|Reinert|1976|p=103}}{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=103}}

Constant strumming with a [[guitar pick]] over the decades has worn a large sweeping hole into the guitar's body near the sound hole—the N-20 has no [[pickguard]] since classical guitars are meant to be played fingerstyle instead of with picks.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}} Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson's friends and associates, ranging from fellow musicians to lawyers and football coaches.{{sfn|Willie Nelson General Store staff|2010}} The first signature on the guitar was [[Leon Russell]]'s, who asked Nelson initially to sign his guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested him to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested Russell to also sign his guitar.{{sfn|Nelson|2005}} In 1991, during his process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: "When Trigger goes, I'll quit". He asked his daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent arrived there, and then deliver it to him in [[Maui]].{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=103}} Nelson then concealed the guitar in his manager's house until his debt was paid off in 1993.{{sfn|Willie Nelson General Store staff|2010}}

==Activism==
Nelson is active in a number of issues. Along with [[Neil Young]] and [[John Mellencamp]], he set up [[Farm Aid]] in 1985 to assist and increase awareness of the importance of family farms, after [[Bob Dylan]]'s comments during the [[Live Aid]] concert that he hoped some of the money would help American farmers in danger of losing their farms through mortgage debt.{{sfn|Durchholz|Graff|2010|p=134}} The first concert included Dylan, [[Billy Joel]], [[B.B. King]], [[Roy Orbison]], and Neil Young among many others, and raised over $9&nbsp;million for America's family farmers.{{sfn|Durchholz|Graff|2010|p=135}} Besides organizing and performing in the annual concerts, Nelson is the president of the board of Farm Aid.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=94}}

Nelson explained that he could not believe that the buildings could collapse due to the planes, attributing instead the result to an implosion.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2010}}

Nelson is an advocate for better treatment for horses and has been campaigning for the passage of the [[Horse slaughter#Federal bills|American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act]] (H.R. 503/S. 311) alongside the [[Animal Welfare Institute]].{{sfn|Nelson|2007b}} He is on its board of directors and has adopted a number of horses from ''Habitat for Horses''.{{sfn|Habitat for Horses staff|2011}} In 2008, Nelson signed on to warn consumers about the cruel and illegal living conditions for calves raised to produce milk for dairy products. He wrote letters to [[Land O'Lakes]] and Challenge Dairy, two of the major corporations that use milk from calves raised at California's Mendes Calf Ranch, which employs an intensive confinement practice that was the subject of a lawsuit and campaign brought by the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]].{{sfn|Nelson|2008}} Nelson is seen in the film ''[[The Garden (2008 film)|The Garden]]'' supporting the impoverished community South Central Farm in Southern Los Angeles.{{sfn|Kennedy|2019}}

A supporter of the [[LGBT]] movement, Nelson published in 2006 through [[iTunes]] a version of [[Ned Sublette]]'s "[[Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other]]", that met instant success.{{sfn|Neu|2006}} During an interview with ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' in 2013, regarding the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and [[same-sex marriage in the United States]], Nelson responded to a comparison the interviewer made with the [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights movement]], stating: "We'll look back and say it was crazy that we ever even argued about this". He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LGBT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became popular quickly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.{{sfn|Langer|2013}}

In June 2018, Nelson deplored the [[Trump administration family separation policy]].{{sfn|Hudak|2018}} During his Fourth of July Picnic, he performed a song with [[Beto O'Rourke]], the Democratic candidate for the [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2018|Senate election in Texas]].

The couple had three children: Lana, Susie, and Willie "Billy" Hugh Jr. The latter died by suicide in 1991.{{sfn|Hall|2008}} The marriage was marked by violence, with Matthews assaulting Nelson several times,{{sfn|Cartwright|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=FBRbZWBZolUC|page=276}} 276]|2000}} including one incident when she sewed him up in bedsheets and beat him with a broomstick.{{sfn|Goldman|2012}} Nelson's next marriage was to [[Shirley Collie]] in 1963. The couple divorced in 1971, after Collie found a bill from the maternity ward of a Houston hospital charged to Nelson and Connie Koepke for the birth of [[Paula Nelson|Paula Carlene Nelson]].{{sfn|Cartwright|2000|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=FBRbZWBZolUC|page=276}} 276]}} Nelson married Koepke the same year, and they had another daughter, Amy Lee Nelson. Following a divorce in 1988, he married his current wife, Annie D'Angelo, in 1991. They have two sons, [[Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real|Lukas Autry]] and Jacob Micah.{{sfn|Riggs|2007|p=239}} In 2012, Nelson learned that he fathered a daughter with his friend Mary Haney. Born on January 22, 1953, Rene Butts (born Lynda Renee Barley) met Nelson and she shared a picture of both of them on Father's Day in 2016. Butts died in 2017.{{sfn|Krauser, Emily|2023}}

Nelson owns "Luck, Texas", a ranch in [[Spicewood, Texas|Spicewood]],{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2017}}{{sfn|Parker|2014}} and also lives in Maui, Hawaii{{sfn|Kane|2008}} with several celebrity neighbors.{{sfn|Grigoriadis|p=57|2007}} While swimming in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's [[Pneumothorax|lung collapsed]]. He was taken to the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled.{{sfn|Krebs|1981}} Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended.{{sfn|O'Hare|2010}} He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco.{{sfn|NPR staff|2012}} In 2008, he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke.{{sfn|Patoski|2011}} In 2004, Nelson underwent surgery for [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2002}} On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery.{{sfn|Miller Loncaric|2008}} In 2012, he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas.{{sfn|McKinnley|2012}} After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent [[stem-cell therapy]] in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.{{sfn|Heim|2015}}

During his childhood, Nelson grew interested in martial arts. He ordered self-defense manuals on [[jujitsu]] and judo that he saw advertised in ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[Superman]]'' comic books. Nelson started to formally practice [[kung fu]] after he moved to Nashville, in the 1960s.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=55}} During the 1980s, Nelson began training in [[tae kwon do|taekwondo]] and now holds a second-degree black belt in that discipline.{{sfn|Chilton|2012}} During the 1990s, Nelson started to practice the Korean martial art [[GongKwon Yusul]].{{sfn|Hall|2014}} In 2014, after 20 years in the discipline, his Grand Master Sam Um presented him with a fifth-degree black belt in a ceremony held in Austin, Texas.{{sfn|Chilton|2014}} A 2014 ''[[Tae Kwon Do Times]]'' magazine interview revealed that Nelson had developed an unorthodox manner of training during the lengthy periods of time he was on tour. Nelson would conduct his martial arts training on his tour bus "The Honeysuckle Rose" and send videos to his supervising Master for review and critique.{{sfn|Zirogiannis|2014}}

In March 2021, "I'll Be Seeing You", a new original by Nelson, was used on a [[public service announcement]] by the [[Ad Council]] to encourage [[COVID-19 vaccination in the United States]].{{sfn|Weisholtz, Drew|2021}} Earlier in January 2021, Nelson and his sister received the [[Moderna COVID-19 vaccine]].{{sfn|Doyle, Patrick|2021}} In May 2022, Nelson postponed several shows after he contracted [[COVID-19]]. Nelson's wife detailed that he was severely affected by the illness, and that he received a treatment including [[Paxlovid]], [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]], and steroids. Nelson resumed his tour in September 2022.{{sfn|Goldstein, Tiffany|2022}} During June 2024, Nelson had to cancel his performances at Outlaw Music Festival due to health complications and was ordered to rest for four days by a doctor.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Morrow |first=Brendan |title=Willie Nelson cancels Outlaw Music Festival performances for health reasons |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/06/23/willie-nelson-illness-outlaw-music-festival/74185542007/ |access-date=June 23, 2024 |newspaper=USA Today}}</ref>

===Legal issues===
Nelson has been arrested several times for marijuana possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in [[Dallas]], Texas.{{sfn|Goddard|2010}} In 1977, after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to [[The Bahamas]]. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=247}} The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=248}} Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=249}}

In 1994, [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Highway patrolmen]] found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas. His requirement to appear in court prevented his attending the Grammy awards that year.{{sfn|Patoski|2011}} While traveling to [[Ann W. Richards]]' funeral in 2006, Nelson, along with his manager and his sister, Bobbie, were arrested in [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana]], and charged with possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms.{{sfn|People staff|2006}} Nelson received six months probation.{{sfn|Patoski|p=471|2008}}

On November 26, 2010, Nelson was arrested in [[Sierra Blanca, Texas]], for possession of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of $2,500.{{sfn|Cline|2010}} Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a $100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking.{{sfn|Caulfield|2011}} Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a $500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement.{{sfn|Amter|2011}} The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence.{{sfn|TMZ staff|2011}} Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.{{sfn|Cohen|2012}}

===Issues with the Internal Revenue Service===
In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, claiming that he owed $32&nbsp;million. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} In 1978, after he fired his manager Neil Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse]]. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped.{{sfn|Patoski|p=407|2008}} While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied),{{sfn|Patoski|p=407|2008}} due to penalties and interests, the debt increased by the end of the decade.{{sfn|Patoski|p=406|2008}}

His lawyer, [[Jay Goldberg]], negotiated the sum to be lowered to $16&nbsp;million. Later, Nelson's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid $6&nbsp;million, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]'' as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending that they put his money in illegal tax shelters.{{sfn|Cowan|1991}} The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount and Nelson cleared his debts by 1993.{{sfn|Johnston|1995}}

In 2003, Texas Governor Perry signed bill No.&nbsp;2582, introduced by State Representative [[Elizabeth Ames Jones]] and Senator [[Jeff Wentworth]], which funded the ''Texas Music Project'', the state's official music charity. Nelson was named honorary chairman of the advisory board of the project.{{sfn|Texas Music Project staff|2011}} In 2005, Democratic Texas Senator [[Gonzalo Barrientos]] introduced a bill to name {{convert|49|mi|km}} of the [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] section of [[Texas State Highway 130|State Highway 130]] after Nelson, and at one point 23 of the 31 state senators were co-sponsors of the bill.{{sfn|Ward|2005}} The legislation was dropped after two Republican senators, [[Florence Shapiro]] and Wentworth, objected, citing Nelson's lack of connection to the highway, his fund raisers for Democrats, his drinking, and his marijuana advocacy.{{sfn|Fort Worth Star-telegram staff|2005}}

An important collection of Willie Nelson materials (1975–1994) became part of the [[Wittliff collections]] of Southwestern Writers, [[Texas State University]], [[San Marcos, Texas]]. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson's IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson's friend [[Bill Wittliff]], who wrote or co-wrote ''Honeysuckle Rose'', ''Barbarosa'' and ''Red Headed Stranger''.{{sfn|Alkek Library staff|2010}} In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the [[Dolph Briscoe Center for American History]]. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items and gifts and tributes from Nelson's fans.{{sfn|Briscoe Center staff|2014}}

In April 2010, Nelson received the "Feed the Peace" award from [[The Nobelity Project]] for his extensive work with Farm Aid and overall contributions to world peace. On June 23, 2010, he was inducted into the Library of Congress's [[National Recording Registry]].{{sfn|Donahue|2010}} Nelson is an honorary trustee of the [[Dayton International Peace Museum]].{{sfn|Dayton Peace Museum staff|2010}}
In 2010, Austin, Texas renamed Second Street to Willie Nelson Boulevard. The city also unveiled [[Willie Nelson statue|a life-size statue]] to honor him, placed at the entrance of ''Austin City Limits''' new studio.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2010}} The non-profit organization Capital Area Statues commissioned sculptor Clete Shields to execute the project.{{sfn|Houston Chronicle staff|2010}} The statue was unveiled on April 20, 2012.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012a}} The date selected by the city of Austin unintentionally coincided with the number 4/20, [[420 (cannabis culture)|associated with cannabis culture]]. In spite of the coincidence and Nelson's advocacy for the legalization of marijuana, the ceremony was scheduled also for 4:20&nbsp;pm. During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song "[[Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die]]".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012b}} The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the [[Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], which was also named after him.{{sfn|Lewis|2012}} In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Berklee College of Music]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2013}} The following year, he was part of the inaugural class inducted into the ''Austin City Limits'' Hall of Fame. Also included among the first inductees was his friend Darrell Royal, whose jamming parties that Nelson participated in were the source of inspiration for the show.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2014}}

For many years, Nelson's image was marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids partially concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of [[Stuff Magazine]] Nelson was interviewed about his long locks.{{sfn|Everett|2010}} "I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's." On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair,{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2010}} and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home.{{sfn|Carter|2010}} In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for $37,000 at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.{{sfn|New York Post staff|2014}}

Nelson's touring and recording group, the Family, is full of longstanding members. The original lineup included his sister Bobbie Nelson, drummer Paul English, harmonicist [[Mickey Raphael]], bassist Bee Spears, drummer/percussionist Billy English (Paul's younger brother), and guitarist [[Jody Payne]].{{sfn|Scobey|1982|pp=198, 358}} The current lineup only includes Nelson himself, Raphael, and Billy English from the classic lineup, as Jody Payne retired (before dying in 2013), Bee Spears died in 2011, Paul English died in 2020, and Willie's sister [[Bobbie Nelson]] died in 2022.{{sfn|Kerns|2012}} ''Willie & Family'' tours North America in the bio-diesel bus ''Honeysuckle Rose'', which is fueled by Bio-Willie.{{sfn|Vancouver Province staff|2007}} Nelson's tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the ''Honeysuckle Rose I'' in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the ''Honeysuckle Rose V''.{{sfn|Langer|2014}}

'''Willy DeVille''' (born '''William Paul Borsey Jr.'''; August 25, 1950 – August 6, 2009) was an American singer and songwriter. During his thirty-five-year career, first with his band [[Mink DeVille]] (1974–1986) and later on his own, DeVille created original songs rooted in traditional American musical styles. He worked with collaborators from across the spectrum of contemporary music, including [[Jack Nitzsche]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Dr. John]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Allen Toussaint]], and [[Eddie Bo]]. [[Music of Latin America|Latin rhythms]], [[blues]] riffs, [[doo-wop]], [[Cajun music]], strains of French [[cabaret]], and echoes of early-1960s uptown [[Soul music|soul]] can be heard in DeVille's work.

Mink DeVille was a [[house band]] at [[CBGB]], the historic New York City nightclub where [[punk rock]] was born in the mid-1970s. DeVille helped redefine the [[Brill Building#"Brill Building Sound"|Brill Building sound]]. In 1987 his song "Storybook Love" was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. After his move to [[New Orleans]] in 1988, he helped spark the [[roots revival]] of classic [[New Orleans rhythm and blues|New Orleans R&B]]. His soulful lyrics and explorations in Latin rhythms and sounds helped define a new musical style sometimes called "Spanish-Americana".<ref>For example, the term "Spanish-Americana appears on DeVille's [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=80140845 MySpace Music page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020027/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile |date=November 17, 2007 }} (Retrieved Jan 24, 2008)</ref>

===The Mink DeVille years===
{{main|Mink DeVille}}
By 1974 Willy DeVille (under the name Billy Borsay) was singing in a band with drummer Thomas R. "Manfred" Allen, Jr., bassist Rubén Sigüenza, guitarist Robert McKenzie (a.k.a. Fast Floyd), and Ritch Colbert on keyboards.<ref>Klein, Howard (October 1977) "Mink De Ville: Slick Fur Fury". ''[[Creem]].'' Vol. 9 No. 5; p. 28.</ref> The band called themselves Billy de Sade and the Marquis, but changed the name to Mink DeVille the year after; at the same time lead singer Borsay adapted the name Willy DeVille. The same year, DeVille persuaded the band members to try their luck in New York City after spotting an ad in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' inviting bands to audition. Guitarist Fast Floyd and keyboard player Ritch Colbert stayed behind in San Francisco (Colbert would shortly head to NY to join the band), and after arriving in New York, the band hired guitarist [[Louis X. Erlanger]], whose [[blues]] sensibilities helped shape the Mink DeVille sound.<ref name="Leap">Marcus, Richard (2006) [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html "Interview: Willy DeVille."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910061842/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html |date=September 10, 2010 }} [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ Leap in the Dark (a blog).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303213036/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ |date=March 3, 2008 }} (Retrieved 1–29–08)</ref>

During three years, from 1975 to 1977, Mink DeVille was one of the original [[house band]]s at [[CBGB]], the New York nightclub where [[punk rock]] music was born in the mid-1970s.<ref name="Leap"/> Their sound from this period is witnessed by ''Live at CBGB's'', a 1976 [[compilation album]] of bands that played CBGB and for which the band contributed three songs.

[[File:Mink DeVille.jpg|thumb|left|272px|[[Louis X. Erlanger]] (left) and DeVille with [[Mink DeVille]] in 1977.]]

In December 1976, Ben Edmonds, an [[A&R]] man for [[Capitol Records]] signed the band to a contract with Capitol Records after spotting them at CBGB.<ref name="CW">{{cite AV media notes|title=Cadillac Walk: The Mink DeVille Collection|others=Mink DeVille|year=2001|last=Edmonds|first=Ben|type=liner notes|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]}}</ref> Edmonds paired Mink DeVille with producer [[Jack Nitzsche]] who had apprenticed under [[Phil Spector]] and helped shape the [[Wall of Sound]] production technique. Assisted by saxophonist [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]] and [[a cappella]] singers the Immortals they recorded the band's debut album ''[[Cabretta]]'' (simply called ''Mink DeVille'' in the U.S.) in January 1976. ''Cabretta'', a multifaceted album of [[Soul music|soul]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], and blues recordings, was selected number 57 in the ''[[Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 1977 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>Christgau, Robert (1977) [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres77.php "The 1977 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll"] [http://www.robertchristgau.com/  Robert Christgau website] (Retrieved January 2, 2008)</ref> Its [[lead single]] "[[Spanish Stroll]]" reached number 20 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], the only Willy DeVille recording to ever hit the charts in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Virgin Book of British Hit Singles]] |year=2008 |edition=1st |editor-first=Martin |editor-last=Roach |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-7535-1537-2 |page=281}}</ref>

The band's follow-up album, ''[[Return to Magenta]]'' (1978), continued in the same vein as ''Cabretta'', except that Willy DeVille and producers Nitzsche and Steve Douglas employed string arrangements on several songs. On this album [[Dr. John]] played keyboards and, once again, Douglas played saxophone. To promote the album, Mink DeVille toured the United States in 1978 with [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Nick Lowe]]. ''Return to Magenta'' reached number 126 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Willy DeVille's highest charting album ever in his home country.<ref name="US200">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4079|pure_url=yes}}|title=Mink DeVille: Billboard Albums|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 11, 2009}}</ref>

In 1979, Willy DeVille took his band in a new direction and recorded an album in Paris called ''[[Le Chat Bleu]]''. For the album, DeVille wrote several songs with [[Doc Pomus]] who had previously seen the band play in New York City.<ref>Halberstadt, Alex (2007) ''Lonely Avenue: The Unlikely Life and Times of Doc Pomus''. New York: Da Capo Press; p. 213</ref> DeVille hired [[Jean Claude Petit]] to supervise [[String section|string arrangements]], and he dismissed the members of the band except for guitarist Louis X. Erlanger in favor of new musicians: [[Accordion]]ist Kenny Margolis, [[Jerry Scheff]] (bass), Ron Tutt (drums) and, once again, Steve Douglas (saxophone), who also served as producer. Capitol Records was not happy with ''Le Chat Bleu'', believing that American audiences were incapable of listening to songs with accordions and lavish string arrangements; consequently they initially released the album only in Europe, in 1980. However, the album sold impressively in America as an import and Capitol finally released it in the United States later the same year.<ref>Loder, Kurt (December 11, 1980) "Willy DeVille's best: ''Le Chat Bleu''."

By this time no members of the original Mink DeVille save Willy DeVille remained in the band, but DeVille continued recording and touring under the name Mink DeVille.<ref>Palmer, Robert (September 25, 1981) "Pop Jazz; Willy DeVille and the Mink in Weekend at the Savoy", ''The New York Times''</ref> He then recorded two albums for [[Atlantic Records]], 1981's ''[[Coup de Grâce (Mink DeVille album)|Coup de Grâce]]''—on which Jack Nitzsche returned as producer—and 1983's ''[[Where Angels Fear to Tread (Mink DeVille album)|Where Angels Fear to Tread]]''. Both sold well in Europe but fared less well in the United States. ''Coup de Grâce'' was DeVille's last album ever to enter the Billboard 200, peaking at number 161.

Mink DeVille's last album, ''[[Sportin' Life (Mink DeVille album)|Sportin' Life]],'' was recorded for [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] in 1985. For this album, DeVille penned two more songs with Doc Pomus. The album was recorded at the [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Alabama]] with [[the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]], and DeVille and Duncan Cameron producing. The album was a hit in some European countries, entering the top 20 in Switzerland and Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swisscharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&artist=Mink+DeVille&artist_search=exact&title=&title_search=starts|title=Swiss Album Charts: Mink DeVille|publisher=swisscharts.com|access-date=October 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&artist=Mink+DeVille&artist_search=exact&title=&title_search=starts|title=Swedish Album Charts: Mink DeVille|publisher=swedishcharts.com |access-date=October 11, 2009}}</ref> In 1986, DeVille filed for bankruptcy as part of what ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called "a major restructuring of his career". He fired his personal manager, Michael Barnett, and announced that he would "put Mink DeVille to bed" and start a solo career. Consequently, Mink DeVille played its last concert on February 20, 1986 in New York City.<ref>Wilner, Rich (March 1, 1986) "DeVille Files for Bankruptcy."

==="Storybook Love" collaboration with Mark Knopfler===
Although Willy DeVille had been recording and touring for ten years under the name [[Mink DeVille]], no members of his original band had recorded or toured with him since 1980's ''[[Le Chat Bleu]]''. Beginning in 1987 with the album ''[[Miracle (Willy DeVille album)|Miracle]]'', DeVille began recording and touring under his own name. He told an interviewer, "Ten years with the band was enough for Mink DeVille; everyone was calling me 'Mink.' I thought it was about time to get the name straight."<ref>''See'' the Billy Pinnell interview with DeVille on Australian radio on the 1994 [[Raven Records|Raven]] CD reissue of ''[[Miracle (Willy DeVille album)|Miracle]]''.</ref>

DeVille recorded ''Miracle'' in London with [[Mark Knopfler]] serving as his [[sideman]] and producer. He said, "It was Mark (Knopfler's) wife Lourdes who came up with the idea (to record ''Miracle''). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?"<ref>Marcus, Richard (2006) [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html "Interview: Willy DeVille"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910061842/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/2006/05/interview_willy_deville.html |date=September 10, 2010 }} [http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ Leap in the Dark (blogsite)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303213036/http://blogs.epicindia.com/leapinthedark/ |date=March 3, 2008 }} (Retrieved June 3, 2008.)</ref> "Storybook Love", a song from ''Miracle'' and the [[Theme music|theme song]] of the movie ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1980s|Academy Awards telecast]].

<blockquote>Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a [[Rob Reiner]] film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy of Arts and Sciences]] with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for "Storybook Love." It's pretty wild. It's not the [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician.

===In New Orleans===
In 1988, DeVille relocated from New York City to [[New Orleans]], where he found a spiritual home. "I was stunned", he said in a 1993 interview. "I had the feeling that I was going back home. It was very strange ... I live in the [[French Quarter]], two streets away from [[Bourbon Street]]; at night, when I go to bed, I hear the [[boogie]] that comes from the streets, and in the morning, when I wake up, I hear the [[blues]]."<ref>Laura Rangel (1993) [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/kingcreole.htm Interviews: King Creole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041218024319/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/kingcreole.htm |date=December 18, 2004 }}, [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/main.htm "Willy DeVille: Spanish Stroll"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224062338/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/main.htm |date=December 24, 2007 }} (Retrieved Jan 29, 2008)</ref>

In 1990, DeVille made ''[[Victory Mixture]]'', a [[tribute album]] of classic New Orleans [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&B]] which he recorded with some of the songs' original composers. The album was recorded without the use of [[overdubbing]] or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordings.

<blockquote>I got all the original guys to come back in, like [[Earl King]], [[Dr. John]] and [[Eddie Bo]]. [[Allen Toussaint]] played side piano. I brought in the rhythm section of [[The Meters]] on a couple of cuts. We call it the "little" record. It's funny, because I was just trying to get them money, the writers of the songs, 'cause they all got ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s. They were all fascinated, and Dr. John (who had played on DeVille's 1978 album ''[[Return to Magenta]]'' and who DeVille knew from his association with [[Doc Pomus]]) convinced them that they wouldn't get ripped off by this northern white boy. That's when I crossed over to being a local here in New Orleans. We were all pleased with it. It's recorded the way it was originally done back then. It's live with no overdubs anywhere, no digital, no editing. We played the song several times and just picked the best take, the one that was the most natural. It's on Fnac/Orleans Records. I'm really proud of that one.<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/></blockquote>

''Victory Mixture'' was recorded for a small independent label, Orleans Records, which licensed it to Sky Ranch (Fnac Music) in France. "It sold over 100,000 units in Europe very quickly—our first [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]]," said Carlo Ditta, founder of Orleans Records and the producer of ''Victory Mixture''.<ref>Sinclair, John (August 24 – September 5, 1998) [http://johnsinclair.us/10for2/index.php?Itemid=110&id=699&option=com_content&task=view "Orleans Records Story."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819030216/http://johnsinclair.us/10for2/index.php?Itemid=110&id=699&option=com_content&task=view |date=August 19, 2011 }} On the Road with John Sinclair.

In the summer of 1992, DeVille toured Europe with Dr John, Johnny Adams, [[Zachary Richard]], and [[The Wild Magnolias]] as part of his "New Orleans Revue" tour. "The travel, buses, and planes and the accommodations had to be some of the worst I've ever experienced ... but the shows themselves were great.

===Recording in Los Angeles===
In 1992, DeVille recorded ''[[Backstreets of Desire]]'', the first of four albums he would record in Los Angeles with producer [[John Philip Shenale]].<ref>DeVille recorded these albums in Los Angeles with [[John Philip Shenale]] as producer: ''[[Backstreets of Desire]]'' (1992), ''[[Loup Garou (album)|Loup Garou]]'' (1995), ''[[Crow Jane Alley]]'' (2004), and ''[[Pistola]]'' (2008).</ref> "I say it every time I record in L.A. — that I'll never do it again, and I keep doing it ... It's crazy. I just record and go to the hotel, and never go out, then back to the studio. I hate L.A. It's the worst. I think they eat their children there. I never saw any kids. It's a pity there aren't more studios in [[New Orleans]]."<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/> Although DeVille complained about having to record in Los Angeles, recording in that city put him in touch with many talented [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] musicians who helped shape his distinctive Spanish-Americana sound.

For ''Backstreets of Desire'', he was joined by [[David Hidalgo]] of [[Los Lobos]], [[Efrain Toro]], [[Mariachi los Camperos]], and [[Jimmy Zavala]], as well as New Orleans musicians [[Dr. John]] and [[Zachary Richard]] and L.A. session musicians [[Jeff Baxter]], [[Freebo]], [[Jim Gilstrap]], and [[Brian Ray]]. [[Allmusic]] said about the album:

<blockquote>Willy DeVille's ''Backstreets of Desire'' stands tall as his masterpiece as both a singer and a songwriter. DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him up to make this disc ... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a tapestry of [[roots rock]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|Crescent City]] [[Second line (parades)|second line]], traces of 1950s [[doo-wop]], and elegant sweeping vistas of [[Brown-eyed soul|Spanish soul]] balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying to get off the street. The sound of the album balances [[Louisiana Creole music|Creole]] soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille sounds like a man resurrected, digging as deep as the cavernous recesses of the human heart.<ref>Jurek, Thom (2007) [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r205611|pure_url=yes}} "Review: Backstreets of Desire"] [https://web.archive.org/web/19961220195136/http://allmusic.com/ Allmusic]. (Retrieved 02-02-2008)</ref></blockquote>

''Backstreets of Desire'' included a novel [[mariachi]] version of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] standard "[[Hey Joe]]" that was a hit in Europe, rising to number one in Spain and France.<ref>''See'' Rene, Sheila (1996) [http://freenet-homepage.de/willydeville/interview.htm "Interview with Willy DeVille"] Willy DeVille fan page. (Retrieved February 2, 2008)</ref> DeVille said about "Hey Joe": "The song originally comes from the Texas-Mexico border area ... [T]hey call it Texico. I tried, instead of doing something that sounded like [[Jimi Hendrix]] that would have been a cliché, I tried to take the song back to the way that it must originally have sounded, which would be with mariachis. It's classic, but it's classic with a little twist. A little different. I put a bit of [[pachuco]] [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] slang talking. I added a couple of verses of my own."<ref>Editors (1994) [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/entrebasicoe.htm " Interview: Concierto Básico."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201011530/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/entrebasicoe.htm |date=December 1, 2008 }} ''Canal magazine''. (Retrieved September 3, 2008)</ref> ''Backstreets of Desire'' was released in the United States in 1994 on [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Record's Forward]] label.

===Continued success in Europe===
In 1984, DeVille married his second wife, Lisa Leggett,<ref name="Trynka, Paul 2007 p. 346">Trynka, Paul (2007) ''Iggy Pop: Open Up and Bleed.'' New York: Broadway Books. p. 346. A footnote in this book reveals wife Lisa's maiden name.</ref> who proved to be an astute business manager. On the strength of his success touring and selling albums in Europe, they bought a horse farm, ''Casa de Sueños'', in [[Picayune, Mississippi]] and began living there as well as at their apartment and studio in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]]. DeVille told an interviewer in 1996: "I finally got the plantation ... I just bought this house and {{convert|11|acre|ha}}. It looks a little bit like [[Graceland]] ... I got into horses since my wife is into them. We're raising Spanish and Portuguese bullfighting horses. The [[Heredity|bloodline]] is 2000 years old. She's into [[Selective breeding|breeding]], but I just love riding. I've also got five dogs, four cats and a partridge in a pear tree."<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/>

DeVille did not have a recording contract with an American label in the mid-1990s. His next two albums, ''[[Willy DeVille Live]]'' (1993) and ''[[Big Easy Fantasy]]'' (1995), were recorded for [[Fnac Music]], a French label. ''Willy DeVille Live'' was a number one record in Spain.<ref name="DeVille, Willy">Eagle Rock Entertainment (2007) [http://www.eaglerockent.com/eaglerockUSA/artist_bios.php?band_id=9 "DeVille, Willy"], Web site of Eagle Rock Entertainment.

DeVille said, "I was pissed off and I didn't have a record deal for a few years. At the time I didn't want one. I was getting very gun-shy about labels. I was performing in Europe and I was doing great without one. When you get to that stage in your mind, they all start coming around. It's pretty strange the way that happens".<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/>

In 1995, he returned to Los Angeles to record ''[[Loup Garou (album)|Loup Garou]]'', again with producer [[John Philip Shenale]]. ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' said about the album: "''Loup Garou'' is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope, it connects the dots between all of the artist's sacrosanct influences, often within the framework of a single song ... All of it is on the money, performed from the heart ... "<ref>Editors (September 1996) "Review of Loup Garou", ''Musician magazine'', p. 90</ref> ''Loup Garou'' featured a duet with [[Brenda Lee]]; DeVille said: "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, and she loved it. She had her business people check me out, and they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years. So I flew to Nashville [to record with her] ... That's got to go down in my book as one of the most memorable experiences in my career."<ref name="Interview with Willy DeVille"/>

The cover of ''Loup Garou'' showed DeVille in turn of the 20th century New Orleans garb posing on a street corner in New Orleans' [[French Quarter]]. It included [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] chants and a song subtitled "Vampire's Lullaby". The singer had completely immersed himself in New Orleans culture. Percussionist Boris Kinberg, a longtime member of the [[Mink DeVille#"The Mink DeVille Band"|Mink DeVille Band]], said about the stages of Willy DeVille's career:

<blockquote>To my mind there were three main eras. The first era was the [[Lower East Side]], skinny tie, purple shirt, ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Sharks [[gang]] vibe. Then it transmuted into the Mississippi plantation-gambler riverboat rogue, the [[Rhett Butler]] thing where he had had custom-made suits, and really got into the period and the clothes and just totally immersed himself in New Orleans, not the present New Orleans, but the New Orleans of the 1880s and 1890s—the [[absinthe]]-drinking, voodoo New Orleans. He totally immersed himself in that. Then he left New Orleans and moved to the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and came back as the second coming of [[Black Elk]].<ref>''See'' interviews on Live in the Lowlands (DVD) (2006; Eagle Rock).</ref></blockquote>

Before moving to the Southwest in 2000, DeVille recorded ''[[Horse of a Different Color (Willy DeVille album)|Horse of a Different Color]]'' in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The 1999 album, produced by [[Jim Dickinson]], includes a [[Chain gang|chain-gang]] song, a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Fred McDowell]]'s "Going over the Hill," and a cover of [[Andre Williams (musician)|Andre Williams]]'s "Bacon Fat". [[Allmusic]] said about the album, "Simply put, no one has this range or depth in interpreting not only styles, but also the poetics of virtually any set of lyrics. DeVille makes everything he sings believable. 'Horse of a Different Color' is the most consistent and brilliant recording of Willy DeVille's long career."<ref>Jurek, Thom (2007) [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r532835|pure_url=yes}} "Review: Horse of a Different Color"] [https://web.archive.org/web/19961220195136/http://allmusic.com/ Allmusic]. (Retrieved September 3, 2008)</ref> ''Horse of a Different Color'' was the first Willy DeVille album since 1987's ''[[Miracle (Willy DeVille album)|Miracle]]'' to be released simultaneously in Europe and the United States. His previous five albums had been released first in Europe and picked up later, if they were picked up at all, by American record labels.

DeVille's stay in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] awakened his interest in his Native American heritage. On the cover of his next album, 2002's ''[[Acoustic Trio Live in Berlin]]'', recorded to celebrate his 25 years' of performing, DeVille wore long hair. He began wearing Native American clothing and jewelry on stage.

In 2004, DeVille returned to Los Angeles to record ''[[Crow Jane Alley]]'', his third album with producer John Philip Shenale. The album continued his explorations of his Spanish-Americana sound and featured many prominent Los Angeles Latino musicians. On the cover, DeVille wore a Native American headdress and breastplate.

Willy DeVille was married in 1971 to Susan Berle (February 19, 1950 – August 12, 2004), who was known as [[Toots Deville]].<ref>For more information about Toots, ''see'' Herwig, Jana (August 7, 2009) [http://digiom.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/what-ever-happened-to-toots-deville/ "What ever happened to Toots DeVille? (Did Heroin kill her?")] [http://digiom.wordpress.com/ digiom (blogsite)]. Retrieved August 17, 2009.</ref> Toots and Willy had known each other while growing up in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. They were married in 1971, and he adopted her son, Sean. [[Alex Halberstadt]], [[Doc Pomus]]'s biographer, wrote about Toots, "Half French and half [[Pima people|Pima Indian]], Toots favored a pair of [[Nose piercing|nose rings]], snow-white [[kabuki]] make-up and a [[The Ronettes|Ronettes]]-style [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] the color of tar. She'd once put out a lit [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] in a woman's eye just for staring at Willy."<ref>Halberstadt, Alex (2007) ''Lonely Avenue: The Unlikely Life and Times of Doc Pomus'', New York: Da Capo Press. p. 214. DeVille said about Toots in 1996, "I haven't seen her in over ten years. I ran off on her, I guess. She was fascinating, all right. She loved to fight and pull knives out. She used to get me into a lot of trouble." [http://freenet-homepage.de/willydeville/interview.htm "Interview with Willy DeVille"] Willy DeVille Fan Page (Retrieved Jan 30, 2008)</ref>

In 1984, DeVille married his second wife, Lisa Leggett, whom he met in California.<ref name="Trynka, Paul 2007 p. 346"/> She became his business manager. They lived near New Orleans and on a horse farm in [[Picayune, Mississippi]]. After her suicide in 2001, he married Nina Lagerwall (daughter of [[Sture Lagerwall]]), his third wife, whom he met in New York in August 2000. They returned to New York City, where he spent the rest of his life.<ref>

==Death and legacy==
In February 2009, DeVille was diagnosed with [[Hepatitis C]], and in May of that year doctors discovered [[pancreatic cancer]] in the course of his Hepatitis C treatment.<ref>[http://www.willydevillemusic.com/index.php?page=news&n_id=78 "News"]. Willy DeVille: Official Website. Retrieved April 22, 2009.</ref> He died in New York City in the late hours of August 6, 2009, three weeks shy of his 59th birthday.<ref>{{cite news| title=Punk pioneer Willy DeVille dies|publisher=BBC News|date=August 10, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8193234.stm|access-date=August 11, 2009}}</ref>

About his legacy, DeVille told an interviewer, "I have a theory. I know that I'll sell much more records when I'm dead. It isn't very pleasant, but I have to get used to this idea."<ref>Rangel, Laura (January 1991) [http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/kingcreole.htm Interviews: King Creole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041218024319/http://personal4.iddeo.es/rangel/kingcreole.htm |date=December 18, 2004 }}.

Jack Nitzsche said that DeVille was the best singer he had ever worked with.<ref>Edmonds, Ben (2001) Liner notes to ''Cadillac Walk: The Mink DeVille Collection''. Edmonds wrote, "During my last conversation with Nitzsche, only months before his death last year, the irascible old witch doctor couldn't stop taking about the new album he'd been plotting with Willy, and how DeVille was the best singer he had ever worked with."</ref>

Critic [[Robert Palmer (American writer)|Robert Palmer]] wrote about him in 1980, "Mr. DeVille is a magnetic performer, but his macho stage presence camouflages an acute musical intelligence; his songs and arrangements are rich in ethnic rhythms and blues echoes, the most disparate stylistic references, yet they flow seamlessly and hang together solidly. He embodies (New York's) tangle of cultural contradictions while making music that's both idiomatic, in the broadest sense, and utterly original."<ref>Palmer, Robert (September 18, 1980) "Pop: Willy DeVille Band", ''The New York Times''; p. C32</ref>

In a 2015 interview, [[Bob Dylan]] suggested DeVille should be in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Said Dylan, "(DeVille) stood out, his voice and presentation ought to have gotten him in there by now."<ref>Dylan, Bob (February 13, 2015) [http://www.bobdylan.com/us/news/post-musicares-conversation-bill-flanagan "A Post-MusiCares Conversation with Bill Flanagan."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321031814/http://www.bobdylan.com/us/news/post-musicares-conversation-bill-flanagan#ixzz3VGLrH2lc |date=March 21, 2015 }} bobdylan.com. (Retrieved Mar 23, 2015.)</ref>

Critic Thom Jurek said about him, "His catalog is more diverse than virtually any other modern performer. The genre span of the songs he's written is staggering. From early rock and rhythm and blues styles, to Delta-styled blues, from Cajun music to New Orleans second line, from Latin-tinged folk to punky salseros, to elegant orchestral ballads—few people could write a love song like DeVille. He was the embodiment of rock and roll's romance, its theater, its style, its drama, camp, and danger."<ref>Jurek, Thom (August 10, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090814152545/http://blog.allmusic.com/2009/08/10/willy-deville-rip-remembering-an-american-original "Willy DeVille, RIP: Remembering an American Original."] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155320/http://blog.allmusic.com/ The Allmusic Blog]. (Retrieved 8–14–09)</ref>

His sometime collaborator [[Mark Knopfler]] said of DeVille, "Willy had an enormous range. The songs he wrote were original, romantic and straight from the heart."<ref>Quote originally published as part of this much longer statement issued by Knopfler at Richard Marcus' request:

<blockquote>I've been an admirer of Willy's since hearing his stunning voice on the radio for the first time. He has an enormous range, with influences from all corners of the country, from Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and New Orleans music to Latin, folk-rock, doo-wop, Ben E. King style soul and R&B – all part of the New York mix. The songs he writes are original, often romantic and always straight from the heart. He can paint a character in a few words.  When we worked on his Miracle album I enjoyed the occasional opportunity to offer a chord or two to go with his great lyrics.</blockquote>

Thom Jurek wrote about him after his death, "Willy DeVille is America's loss even if America doesn't know it yet. The reason is simple: Like the very best rock and roll writers and performers in our history, he's one of the very few who got it right; he understood what made a three-minute song great, and why it mattered—because it mattered to him. He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first time—or, at the very least, remember him for what he really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did."<ref>Jurek, Thom (August 10, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090814152545/http://blog.allmusic.com/2009/08/10/willy-deville-rip-remembering-an-american-original "Willy DeVille, RIP: Remembering an American Original"], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155320/http://blog.allmusic.com/ The Allmusic Blog]. (Retrieved Aug 14, 2009)</ref>

Singer [[Peter Wolf]] of the [[J. Geils Band]] said about him, "He had all the roots of music that I love and had this whole street thing of R&B – just the whole gestalt ... He was just a tremendous talent; a true artist in the sense that he never compromised. He had a special vision and remained true to it."<ref>Editors (April 1, 2010) [https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/04/01/peter-wolf-on-totally-unrecognized-singer-willy-deville/ "Peter Wolf on 'Totally Unrecognized' Singer Willy DeVille."] Speakeasy: ''The Wall Street Journal'' blog. (Retrieved October 4, 2010.)</ref>

Writing in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' about the posthumous release of DeVille's ''Come a Little Bit Closer: The Best of Willy DeVille Live'' (2011), Marc Meyers declared, "There was creative heat and pain in Mr. DeVille's eerie, edgy look and sound. While his punk-roadhouse fusion sailed over the heads of many at home, his approach inspired many British pop invaders of the 1980s, including [[Tears for Fears]], [[Human League]] and [[Culture Club]] ... He was a punk eclectic with a heart of golden oldies and [[Joe Cocker]]'s pipes. A seedy sophisticate, Mr. DeVille was decades ahead of his time."<ref>Meyers, Marc (May 20, 2011) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576331281185742912 Brilliant, Shook-Up Guy].

In 2022 the documentary ''Heaven Stood Still: The Incarnations of Willy DeVille'' was released portraying his life and music directed by Larry Locke and featuring Willy DeVille, Chris Frantz, Ben E.

Naomi Judd and Michael Ciminella had a daughter together they named [[Ashley Judd|Ashley]]. The couple moved with the two girls to Los Angeles in 1968, but were divorced by 1972.<ref name="allmusic" /> By 1976, Naomi Judd took the girls with her back to [[Kentucky]]. Wynonna was inspired by the [[country music]] that her mother listened to and learned to play guitar. In 1979 the family moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], so Naomi and Wynonna could pursue musical careers. There her mother legally changed her name from Diana to Naomi, and Christina adopted the stage name "Wynonna" after the song "[[(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66]]", which mentions the town of [[Winona, Arizona]], in the lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dukes |first=Billy|title=Country Stars' Real Names: Wynonna Judd |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/wynonna-real-name/ |access-date=April 14, 2022 |website=Taste of Country |date=February 7, 2012 |language=en |archive-date=August 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817233623/https://tasteofcountry.com/wynonna-real-name/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Wynonna Judd performs live in 2018.jpg|thumb|Wynonna Judd performs live]]
On January 27, 1992, Wynonna performed solo on television for the first time at the American Music Awards. She unveiled "[[She Is His Only Need]]", the first single from her self-titled solo debut album. This album, ''[[Wynonna (album)|Wynonna]]'', was released in 1992 via MCA/Curb, under the production of [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsal/fr/Wynonna.htm |title=Wynonna-Review of Wynonna's first self-titled album |access-date=April 8, 2009 |work=[[About.com]] |archive-date=January 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120082638/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsal/fr/Wynonna.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> "She Is His Only Need" went to number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts that year, as did the album's next two singles, "[[I Saw the Light (Wynonna Judd song)|I Saw the Light]]" and "My Strongest Weakness". "[[No One Else on Earth]]",<ref name="allmusic" /> was also the number one country song of 1992 according to [[Billboard Year-End]]. "She Is His Only Need" and "No One Else on Earth" were also minor Adult Contemporary hits, and the latter peaked at No. 83 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "[[My Strongest Weakness]]", the album's final single, was a No. 4 country hit. The album shipped five million copies in the United States, earning a 5× Multi-Platinum certification from the [[RIAA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA|accessdate=March 11, 2023}}</ref>

Her second album, ''[[Tell Me Why (Wynonna Judd album)|Tell Me Why]]'', was released by MCA/Curb in 1993.<ref name="allmusic" /> Also a platinum-selling album, it accounted for five consecutive Top Ten hits on the country charts: the [[Tell Me Why (Wynonna Judd song)|title track]], "Only Love", "Is It Over Yet", "Rock Bottom", and "[[Girls with Guitars]]", which was written by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]. "Tell Me Why" was her third crossover hit, peaking at No. 77 on the pop charts and No. 24 on the Adult Contemporary charts. Between "Tell Me Why" and "Only Love", she sang guest vocals on [[Clint Black]]'s 1993 single "[[A Bad Goodbye]]" (from the album ''[[No Time to Kill]]''), which became her biggest pop hit at No. 43. The success of this song led to a tour called the Black & Wy tour, featuring Black and Wynonna as headliners.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&p_theme=sltb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1011390E32EF660F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title="Black & Wy" give 2 great shows in 1 |access-date=April 24, 2009 |last=Buttars |first=Lon |date=September 25, 1993 |work=Salt Lake Tribune |archive-date=October 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013071227/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&p_theme=sltb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1011390E32EF660F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1994, she also made an appearance on the [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] tribute album ''[[Skynyrd Frynds]]'', on which she covered their song "[[Free Bird]]". She also sang duet vocals on pop-Christian singer [[Michael English (American singer)|Michael English]]'s debut single, "Healing", which peaked at No. 120 on the pop charts. After "Girls with Guitars" fell from the charts, Wynonna became the subject of negative publicity, as she had a child out of wedlock.<ref name="allmusic" /> She was absent from the country charts for all of 1995. In 1996, she married Arch Kelly, the father of her daughter and  son.<ref name="allmusic" />

''[[Revelations (Wynonna Judd album)|Revelations]]'' was the title of her third album, released by MCA/Curb in 1996. Also certified platinum, this album was led off by her fourth and final number one hit, the [[Mike Reid (singer)|Mike Reid]]/[[Gary Burr]] co-written "[[To Be Loved by You (Wynonna Judd song)|To Be Loved by You]]". Despite this song's minor Adult Contemporary success, the album's other three singles did not fare as well:<ref name="allmusic" />

Wynonna's fourth and final album for MCA was titled ''[[The Other Side (Wynonna Judd album)|The Other Side]]''. Unlike her previous country pop-oriented albums, this album focused on a more [[blues music|blues]] and rock sound.<ref name="allmusic" /> It was released in 1997 and produced four singles. The album did not sell as well as her first three, however, only earning a gold certification. Its singles were not as successful on the charts, either: although "[[When Love Starts Talkin']]" and "[[Come Some Rainy Day]]" reached No. 13 and No. 14, respectively, "Always Will" fell short of Top 40 and "Love Like That" became the first single of her career not to chart at all. After the release of a greatest hits album called ''[[Collection (Wynonna Judd album)|Collection]]'', Wynonna left MCA in favor of [[Mercury Records]].<ref name="allmusic" />

This album, the first of her career that Wynonna co-produced, included a four-song bonus disc entitled ''Big Bang Boogie'' composed of four new Judds songs.<ref name="allmusic" />

''[[What the World Needs Now Is Love (Wynonna Judd album)|What the World Needs Now Is Love]]'', her sixth studio album, was  released in August 2003, on Curb records.

This latter song, originally recorded by [[Lari White]] on her album ''[[Stepping Stone (album)|Stepping Stone]]'', featured backing vocals from Naomi, and was credited on the charts as "Wynonna with Naomi Judd" instead of the Judds. Judd had success on the [[Hot Dance Airplay]] charts with a cover of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s "[[I Want to Know What Love Is]]".
