'''Ace in the Hole Band''' is the [[backup band]] for American [[country music]] performer [[George Strait]], who was the band's lead singer before beginning his solo career in the early 1980s. The band formed at [[San Marcos, Texas]] in the 1970s, and recorded several singles for "D Records" including the Strait-penned "I Just Can't Go On Dying Like This" and "I Don't Want To Talk It Over Anymore". After Strait attained status as the "[[King of Country]]", the group released an album of its own in 1995 featuring vocals from [[Darrell McCall]] and [[Mel Tillis]].

The band, originally known as "Stoney Ridge", performs such styles of traditional country music as [[honky-tonk]] and [[western swing]] and were influenced by such performers as [[Bob Wills]], [[Johnny Bush]], and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]].  Contemporaries of the band include [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].

==Background==

===Origins===
The Ace in the Hole Band derived from the band "Stoney Ridge," which was composed of [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University]] (now Texas State) students Ron Cabal (lead [[guitar]]), Mike Daily ([[steel guitar]]), Terry Hale ([[Bass guitar]]), Tommy Foote ([[drum kit|drums]]) and Jay Dominguez (lead vocals). Dominguez and Foote left the band after graduating in 1975, prompting a search for a new singer. The band members posted bulletins around the campus of Southwest Texas.<ref name="texas"/> One was noticed by an [[agricultural science]] student, George Strait. He contacted the band and was hired after an audition. Soon after, the group was renamed "Ace in the Hole" and George quickly became the lead singer.<ref name="texas">{{cite web |url=http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |title=Ace in the Hole Band |author=Grant Mazak |date=2006 |work=Texas Music History Online |publisher=Texas State University |access-date=December 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811234143/http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |archive-date=August 11, 2010}}</ref>

The band regularly performed at Cheatham Street Warehouse in [[San Marcos, Texas]], where they debuted on October&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1975 along with new member Ted Stubblefield, who temporarily replaced Foote as the drummer. Acts such as [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] also played at the forum. The band appeared at the locale nearly every week until the early 1980s, when they began touring with Strait. Drummer Foote returned to the lineup late in 1975<ref name="texas"/> and remained as drummer until 1983 when he relinquished his position to become the band's road manager.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Michael|title=San Marcos musicians discovered Strait; the rest is country music history|url=http://straitfever.homestead.com/aceintheholeband.html|access-date=2014-05-18|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|date=2009-09-25}}</ref> Tommy Foote died in May 2024.

===Recording===
In 1976, [[Pappy Daily]], the grandfather of band member Mike Daily, decided to record the group for his "D Records" label at a studio in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. At the first session, the band recorded [[Dallas Frazier]]'s "Honky Tonk Downstairs" (later recorded on Strait's 1981 debut album ''[[Strait Country]]'') and the Strait-penned "I Just Can't Go on Dying Like This" (later recorded on Strait's 2013 album ''[[Love Is Everything (George Strait album)|Love Is Everything]]''). The songs were released to radio stations in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. In 1977, Bill Mabry was added to the lineup as a fiddle player and the band recorded their second single, which featured the songs "Lonesome Rodeo Cowboy" (later recorded on Strait's 1990 album ''[[Livin' It Up (album)|Livin' It Up]]'') and "That Don’t Change the Way I Feel About You" which was written by Strait. The next year, the band recorded the songs "[[Right or Wrong (1921 song)|Right or Wrong]]," and "[[Little Liza Jane]]",<ref name="texas"/> which were later included on the 2005 D Records label release ''Complete D Singles Collection, Vol. 6: The Sounds of Houston, Texas''.<ref name="houston"/> Strait re-recorded "Right or Wrong" in 1983 for his album ''[[Right or Wrong (George Strait album)|Right or Wrong]]'' and took it to number one on the country charts. "The Loneliest Singer in Town" and Strait's "I Don’t Want to Talk It Over Anymore" also came out of this session. The three songs composed by Strait were later released on his 1995 compilation album ''[[Strait Out of the Box]]''.<ref name="box">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r223204|pure_url=yes}} |title=Strait Out of the Box |author=Bruce Eder |work=Allmusic.com |access-date=December 8, 2011}}</ref>

In 1981, after Strait signed with [[MCA Records]], the band began to tour with him and played the instrumentals on his recordings. They were honored in 1991 with the SRO's "Touring Band of the Year."<ref name="all">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p50310|pure_url=yes}} |title=Ace in the Hole Band |author=Charlotte Dillon |work=Allmusic.com |access-date=December 8, 2011}}
</ref> Four years later, the band released an album without vocals from Strait, featuring singers [[Darrell McCall]] and [[Mel Tillis]].<ref name="texas"/>

==Style==
The band plays in a [[honky-tonk]] and [[western swing]] style, and credits such performers as [[Bob Wills]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Johnny Bush]], [[George Jones]], [[Merle Haggard]] and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]] as influences.<ref name="texas"/> [[Allmusic]] describes the band's styles as [[Alternative country]], [[Neotraditional country|Neotraditional]] and [[Western swing]] revival.<ref name="all"/> Because of the group's traditional style, performances in the city of [[Austin, Texas]] did not occur often due to the city's demand for progressive sounds.<ref name="texas"/> Strait traveled to [[Nashville]] in 1977 with hopes of beginning a career, but most in the industry passed on him, shunning his traditional approach for pop-influenced sounds popular in country music during the late 1970s [[Urban Cowboy]] era.<ref name="texas"/>

'''BR549''' (originally spelled '''BR5-49''') was an American [[country rock]] band founded in 1993.<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=61}}</ref> It originally consisted of Gary Bennett (lead and background vocals, acoustic guitar), Don Herron (steel guitar, [[resonator guitar]], fiddle, mandolin, acoustic guitar), "Smilin'" Jay McDowell (upright bass), [[Chuck Mead]] (lead and background vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar), and "Hawk" Shaw Wilson (drums, background vocals).<ref name="Larkin90"/> Bennett and McDowell left the band in 2001, with [[Chris Scruggs]] and Geoff Firebaugh respectively replacing them. Both Firebaugh and Scruggs later left the band as well; Mark Miller has become the band's third bassist. The name of the band is taken from a mangled phone number from ''[[Hee Haw]]'' comedian [[Junior Samples]]' car salesman skit.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygsEAAAAMBAJ&q=BR-549|title=Dial BR5-49 For Alternate Country|magazine=Billboard|last=Bessman |first=Jim|date=15 July 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en|page=1}}</ref>

BR549 released six albums and two EPs, including three albums on [[Arista Nashville]] and two on [[Dualtone Records]]. The band's self-titled [[BR5-49 (album)|debut album]] produced three singles on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1996. The band was nominated three times for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], in 1996 ("Cherokee Boogie"), 1997 ("Wild One") and 1999 ("Honky Tonk Song").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/br5-49/8344 |title=BR5-49 |publisher=[[Grammy Awards]]}}</ref> As well as a nomination for the Top New Vocal Duo or Group award from the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] in 1997.<ref name="Past winners and nominees">{{Cite news |url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners |title=Winners database |work=ACM Country |access-date=December 29, 2022}}</ref>

==History==
{{Expand section|More info on each album, critical reception, sound|date=January 2009}}
Before moving to Nashville and forming BR5-49, Chuck Mead played in a band called Homestead Grays, a roots-rock outfit based in his hometown of [[Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref name="Larkin90"/> Gary Bennett, meanwhile fronted an informal band that played at [[Robert's Western World|Robert's Western Wear]], a clothing store in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], when he met Mead at a nearby bar.<ref name=Huey/> The two then decided to form a band officially, and completing the lineup were electric bassist Jim "Bones" Becker, then [[upright bass]]ist "Smilin'" Jay McDowell (formerly of another band called Hellbilly), multi-instrumentalist Don Herron, and drummer "Hawk" Shaw Wilson. They assumed the name BR5-49 (from the telephone number of a used car dealer in a running [[Junior Samples]] comedy sketch on the television series ''[[Hee Haw]]''),<ref name=Huey/> and began playing for tips at Robert's.

===1995–2000: Arista Nashville===
They were signed by [[Arista Nashville]] in September 1995.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ag4EAAAAMBAJ&q=BR-549&pg=PA30|title=Twain Dominates Canadian Awards; BR-549 Signed To Arista, Finally|magazine=Billboard|last=Flippo |first=Chet|date=30 September 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en|page=30}}</ref> The band's first release for the label was an [[extended play]] entitled ''Live at Robert's'', which comprised originals and cover songs.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Following it in 1996 was their full-length debut album, also titled ''[[BR5-49 (album)|BR5-49]]''.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Despite minimal support from country radio,<ref name=Huey/> the album's lead-off single "Cherokee Boogie" (a cover of a [[Moon Mullican]] song) reached No.&nbsp;44 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts in the US, and No.&nbsp;21 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts in Canada. Following this song were "Even If It's Wrong" and "Little Ramona (Gone Hillbilly Nuts)",<ref name="Larkin90"/> which respectively reached No.&nbsp;68 and No.&nbsp;61 in the US. The album itself was a No.&nbsp;33 on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart. The band also toured with [[The Mavericks]], [[Junior Brown]], and [[The Black Crowes]] and played on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' in 1997.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/artists/program78.html Mary Chapin Carpenter followed by BR5-49], Austin City Limits, 1997</ref>   According to the All Music Guide to Country, BR5-49's recording of "Honky Tonk Song" on the BR5-49 album should be considered an essential country song, although it does not consider either the album itself, or the group essential.<ref>Vladimir Bogdanov, et al, editors ''All Music Guide to Country'', 2nd Edition, Ann Arbor: AMG, 2003</ref>

BR5-49's second album, ''[[Big Backyard Beat Show]]'', was released in 1998.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Despite not producing a chart single, this album reached No.&nbsp;38 on the Top Country Albums chart. After touring with [[Brian Setzer]], the band issued a live album, ''Coast to Coast'', in 1999 on Arista as well. The band left Arista in 2000 after the label was merged with [[Sony BMG]].

===2001–present===
After being dropped from Arista, they signed to Lucky Dog Records, a subsidiary of [[Epic Records]]. Their first release for the label, 2001's ''This Is BR549'', also eliminated the [[hyphen]] from the band's name.<ref name=Huey/> Its only single, "Too Lazy to Work, Too Nervous to Steal", peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on Country Singles Sales but did not enter the country singles charts proper. After this album, both Bennett and McDowell left the band, with Geoff Firebaugh succeeding McDowell as upright bassist, and [[Chris Scruggs]] taking over on guitar and vocals. The new lineup made its first appearance in 2003 on their self released album ''Temporarily Disconnected''. In 2004, they signed with [[Dualtone Records]] and released ''Tangled in the Pines''. Scruggs left the band to tour solo in 2005. Firebaugh also left to start his own band, Hillbilly Casino. Mark Miller replaced Firebaugh. A second album for Dualtone, ''Dog Days'', was released in early 2006.

Since 2013 the band has been on hiatus, with Chuck Mead working solo with Mark Miller playing bass, and Don Herron touring with [[Bob Dylan]].  On July 12, 2012, Jay McDowell announced on his personal Facebook page that the original line-up of BR5-49 would open for [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] at Woods Amphitheater in Nashville, TN on July 28. On July 27, 2012, the (reunited) original lineup recorded an original Gary Bennett song called "A Truck Stop Christmas" at the East Nashville Studio of Phil Harris, which was released on the 2012 Christmas compilation ''An East Nashville Christmas''.  On May 9, 2013, it was announced that the original lineup would play together live once again, this time at the Havelock Country Jamboree in Canada on August 17, 2013.

==Status of former members==
Original co-frontman Gary Bennett released his solo debut, ''Human Condition'', in February 2006. In October 2010 [[Raucous Records]] released Bennett's follow up album ''My Ol' Guitar'' co-produced by [[Kenny Vaughan]] and including several BR549 re-recordings.

Smilin' Jay McDowell has gone on to work in post production in the music video world. He is now in charge of the video department for the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Nashville. He directed a DVD project for Gary Bennett titled ''Inside and Out''.

Former bassist Geoff Firebaugh founded a [[rockabilly]] band named Hillbilly Casino that are a crowd favorite in downtown Nashville on lower Broadway.

Chris Scruggs released a solo album titled ''Anthem'' in 2009. As of 2015, he is the bassist and multi-instrumentalist in [[Marty Stuart]]’s backing band, The Fabulous Superlatives.

Chuck Mead released ''Journeyman's Wager'' in 2009 and toured with his Grassy Knoll Boys in support of the release; this was followed by the classic-country covers album ''Back at the Quonset Hut'' in 2012 and ''Free State Serenade'' in 2014.  In 2006 Chuck began his association with the hit Broadway Musical ''[[Million Dollar Quartet (musical)|Million Dollar Quartet]]'' beginning in Florida as the Musical Arranger and Musical Director; he has also worked with the cast at The [[Village Theatre]] near Seattle, Washington, The [[Goodman Theatre]] in Chicago and The [[Nederlander Theatre]] on Broadway in New York City.  He is currently{{when|date=June 2017}} working with the new cast in England as they prepare to open at The [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in  [[City of Westminster]].

Mark Miller was a founding member of The Ex-Husbands, formed in New York City in 1993 with lead singer Anders Thomsen and drummer Michael Smith. The band released two critically acclaimed albums on Tar Hut Records – a self-titled debut and the follow-up, ''All Gussied Up''.  Both made the Gavin Americana top 20 and the latter reached that chart's top 10. Miller released the solo record ''Dodsen Chapel'' in 2005.

Original bass picker Jim "Bones" Becker is now retired and says, "I'm not doing anything now, and I'm getting damn good at it!"

==Musical style and influences==
{{Expand section|date=July 2023}}
According to ''[[Trouser Press]]'', while [[alternative country]] bands typically try to emulate the sound of pre-[[rock and roll]] era country music, BR549's sound draws from post-rock and roll styles, "when honky tonk, [[rockabilly]], [[Western swing]], bittersweet storyteller swill and [[Sheb Wooley]] all commingled in search of proper homes in the evolving [[country music|country]] landscape."<ref name=TrouserPress>{{cite web |url=https://trouserpress.com/reviews/br549/ |title=BR549 |last= |first= |publisher=Trouser Press |access-date=2022-11-09}}</ref> BR549's sound  encompasses alternative country,<ref name=Huey>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/br5-49-mn0000071958/biography |title=BR5-49 Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=2022-11-09}}</ref><ref name=TrouserPress/> Western swing,<ref name=Huey/> [[Bakersfield sound]],<ref name=Huey/> rockabilly<ref name=Huey/><ref name=TrouserPress/> and [[country rock]].<ref name=Huey/><ref name=TrouserPress/> According to ''Trouser Press'', the band "poised themselves as authentic defenders of the faith, but a name taken from a recurring ''Hee Haw'' skit and a predilection for campy vintage clothing threatened to make them alt-country’s answer to [[Sha Na Na]]."<ref name=TrouserPress/> Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] described their sound and appearance as "unabashedly retro", as the band's members dressed in "old, budget-friendly clothes".<ref name=Huey/>

Asked about faith, Thornton said "I’m not what you’d call a traditional religious person. We went to the Methodist church—every Sunday you put on your little creepy suit with your clip-on tie and went to church. But it wasn’t like I paid any attention. Hardcore Christians and atheists—they both say they know exactly what the deal is. Anybody who says, “I know what happens,” I don't believe them. That's kind of my religion."<ref name="mensjournal_com" />

'''Blue Rodeo''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[country rock]] band formed in 1984 in [[Toronto]], Ontario. They have released 16 full-length studio albums, four live recordings, one greatest hits album, and two video/DVDs, along with multiple solo albums, side projects, and collaborations.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/discography/|title = Discography|work = Official Community of Blue Rodeo|access-date = November 20, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
[[High school]] friends Jim Cuddy and Greg Keelor began playing music professionally together after completing university. They put together several bands without commercial success in the late 1970s, releasing a single as Hi-Fi's in 1980.

Cuddy and Keelor moved to [[New York City]] in the early 1980s to further their music careers. There, they met keyboardist and fellow Canadian [[Bob Wiseman]], who, at that time, was working as a producer. Upon returning to [[Toronto]] in the summer of 1984, the trio decided to form a band. The name "Blue Rodeo" had already been chosen for the new group when they met former [[David Wilcox (Canadian musician)|David Wilcox]] drummer [[Cleave Anderson]] and asked him to join. Anderson, in turn, recommended his former bandmate in The Sharks, bassist Bazil Donovan, and the new band's lineup was essentially set.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bluerodeo.com/people/biography/JimCuddy.aspx| title=Jim Cuddy Biography| work=Official Community of Blue Rodeo| access-date=May 14, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092840/http://www.bluerodeo.com/people/biography/JimCuddy.aspx| archive-date=May 12, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> On February 7, 1985, Blue Rodeo played their first show together at [[The Rivoli]] in Toronto;<ref>Schneider, Jason [http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=139&csid2=9&fid1=42671 Timeline: Blue Rodeo: Better Off as We Are]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''[[Exclaim!]]'' December 2009.</ref> one week later, they performed at [[Handsome Ned]]'s "Honky Tonk Heart."<ref>"The birth of Blue Rodeo." ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 16, 2004.</ref>

The band quickly earned a following in Toronto and was subsequently signed to Canadian independent record label Risque Disque. They entered the studio in 1986 with [[Rush (band)|Rush]] producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]] and recorded several songs that would comprise Blue Rodeo's debut album, ''[[Outskirts (album)|Outskirts]]''. Released in March 1987, ''Outskirts'' met with moderate success in Canada until "[[Try (Blue Rodeo song)|Try]]" was released as a single in October of that year. The single was an immediate hit, going to number one on the ''RPM Country Tracks'' chart and number six on the ''RPM Top Singles'' chart, establishing Blue Rodeo as one of Canada's top new bands and carrying ''Outskirts'' to 4× Platinum status in sales. The music video for the single featured Keelor's then-girlfriend [[Michelle McAdorey]], who soon had success with her own band, [[Crash Vegas]].

In 1992, the band's song "After the Rain," written by Cuddy and Keelor, was the most-performed song in Canada.<ref name="Inc.1992">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title='Do it for you' does it at the SOCAN Awards|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|date=14 November 1992|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> By 1999 the band had sold more than two million albums in Canada.<ref name="Inc.1999">{{cite magazine|author=Bettsy Powell|title=There's no place like home|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58|date=January 16, 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=50 and 58|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

Cuddy, Keelor, Donovan, Boguski and Cripps have all released solo albums. Glenn Milchem performs his own solo music under the pseudonym "the swallows" and had co-founded, with his twin brother John, the rock duo [[Starvin Hungry]]. Keelor has also gone on to produce for other artists, notably alt-country group [[Cuff the Duke]], who have also toured as support for Blue Rodeo.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=139&csid2=9&fid1=42671| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709190255/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=139&csid2=9&fid1=42671| url-status=dead| archive-date=July 9, 2012| title=Blue Rodeo Timeline| work=Exclaim Magazine| access-date=July 5, 2010}}</ref>

==Concerts==

On August 11, 1988, the band played at the Erie County Fair in Hamburg, New York (a suburb of Buffalo). They were the headliners after a high school battle of the bands competition. The disastrous gig was the inspiration for their 1990 hit, "What Am I Doing Here."

==Career==
===2004–2006: Career beginnings and debut===
[[File:brandi-carlile2.jpg|thumb|Carlile performing in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] in 2006]]

Carlile began her career performing in Seattle music clubs with twin brothers [[Phil and Tim Hanseroth]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Scanlon |first=Tom |title=Rising stars Jesse Sykes and Brandi Carlile thrill hometown |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News. |page=1 |date=April 1, 2007 }}</ref> In the beginning, [[Columbia Records]] signed Carlile in 2004 on the strength of songs she had been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Carlile showcased those early songs along with newly recorded tracks in the self-titled album ''[[Brandi Carlile (album)|Brandi Carlile]]''. The 2006 re-release by Columbia Records included re-recordings of "Throw It All Away" and "What Can I Say".{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The album earned enthusiastic reviews; she was featured on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s "10 Artists to Watch in 2005" list, and other "artist to watch" lists by [[Interview (magazine)|''Interview'']] and [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']]. In his review of the album, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote, "The accolades, combined with cover artwork that captures her at her cutest – as if she were a cousin of [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] – might make some listeners suspicious of Carlile, since the cumulative effect makes her seem like a pretty, prepackaged creation." He further wrote, "her music is... rich, warm, and seductive, familiar in its form and sound, yet sounding fresh, even original, particularly in how her folky singer/songwriter foundation blends with her art-pop inclinations."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/brandi-carlile-mw0000190795 |title=Brandi Carlile – Brandi Carlile – Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards – AllMusic |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212082356/http://www.allmusic.com/album/brandi-carlile-mw0000190795 |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The album peaked at No. 80 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard charts|US Folk Albums]] chart.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Shortly after the release of the album, she left her home in [[Seattle]] and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, as she had worked with them on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album [[The Story (Brandi Carlile album)|''The Story'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile |title=Brandi Carlile |website=Last.fm |access-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120041833/http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile |archive-date=January 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists, including [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[the Fray]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Tori Amos]], and [[Shawn Colvin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile/+wiki |title=Brandi Carlile |website=Last.fm |access-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112134914/http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile/+wiki |archive-date=January 12, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2007–2009: Breakthrough with ''The Story''===
Carlile's second album, ''[[The Story (Brandi Carlile album)|The Story]]'', was produced by [[T Bone Burnett]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/brandicarlile/a/BCarlileQA.htm |title=About.com: Interview With Brandi Carlile |publisher=Folkmusic.about.com |date=June 14, 2010 |access-date=September 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516214315/http://folkmusic.about.com/od/brandicarlile/a/BCarlileQA.htm |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |url-status=live }} </ref> It includes a collaboration with the [[Indigo Girls]] on "Cannonball". The album was recorded in an 11-day session with Carlile, the Hanseroths, and drummer [[Matt Chamberlain]] to capture the raw intensity of Carlile's live performances. The crack in Carlile's vocals during the title track, "The Story", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}} "The Story" was featured heavily in [[General Motors]] commercials during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/heard/289/let-the-games-begin-olympic-ads-go-for-the-gold |title=Yahoo Music |date=October 14, 2014 |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910185853/http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/heard/289/let-the-games-begin-olympic-ads-go-for-the-gold |archive-date=September 10, 2008 |access-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following the release of the commercials, album sales increased 368 percent from 1,323 to 6,198.

The album has sold more than 257,776 copies in the US and peaked at No. 41 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 10 on the [[Billboard charts|US Rock Albums]] chart.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Music critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] praised Carlile for ''The Story'', saying, "The roiling collection fulfills the promise of her remarkable debut, offering resounding confirmation that Carlile is a singular talent."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-story-mw0000478967 |title=The Story – Brandi Carlile – Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards – AllMusic |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212083552/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-story-mw0000478967 |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

"It wasn't until 2007's ''The Story'' – her T-Bone Burnett-produced sophomore release – that we realized even half of what we'd been dealt. Nearly a minute into the second song, something about her shifted from promise to absolute certainty as Carlile let loose a hurricane of lung power" wrote Rachael Maddux for [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']] magazine.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Three songs from Carlile's previous album, "Tragedy", "What Can I Say", and "Throw It All Away", were featured in the TV drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. A special two-hour episode of ''Grey's Anatomy'' also featured Carlile's song "Turpentine" during footage of the spin-off, ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]''. ''Grey's Anatomy'' also released a version of the music video for "The Story" with interspersed footage of the show. Actress [[Sara Ramirez]] performed her version of Carlile's single "The Story" in the [[Song Beneath the Song|musical episode]] of the show.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

In 2011, Carlile's album ''[[Live at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony]]'' reached number 14 on the [[Top Rock Albums]] chart. The live album finds Carlile performing a mix of original songs and cover material. Recorded during two sold-out shows in November 2010 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington, the album features [[Washington (state)|Washington]]-native Carlile and her long-time band (including brothers [[Phil and Tim Hanseroth]]) performing alongside the [[Seattle Symphony]]. Andrew Leahey from [[AllMusic]] called it Carlile's best and wrote, "'Live at Benaroya Hall' is more concerned with dressing up Carlile's music in elegant, orchestral clothing, and the results are pretty stunning, from the grandeur of 'The Story' – now featuring horns, woodwinds, and strings. This isn't Brandi Carlile's first concert album, but it's certainly the best."{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

"We didn't make any demos. To me rock and roll isn't really a genre but more of recklessness or a risk," Carlile told [[NPR Music|NPR]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diffuser.fm/10-albums-worth-looking-forward-to-in-early-2015/ |title=10 Albums Worth Looking Forward to in Early 2015 |website=[[Diffuser.fm|Diffuser]] |date=January 2, 2015 |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103095833/http://diffuser.fm/10-albums-worth-looking-forward-to-in-early-2015/ |archive-date=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> "The more something gets ironed out and sure of itself, the less it begins to rock somehow.

It will be hard to top the original, though; it so eloquently highlights the telepathic connection Carlile shares with her longtime bandmates. A favorite on recent tours, "The Eye" is destined to become a centerpiece in Carlile's catalog."<ref name="npr.org" />

The album was No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s Top Rock Album Chart,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6502048/brandi-carlile-career-highs-rock-charts |title=Brandi Carlile Scores Multiple Career Highs on Rock Charts |website=Billboard.com |access-date=April 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909113713/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6502048/brandi-carlile-career-highs-rock-charts |archive-date=September 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and a first for her.

''[[KCMP|The Current]]'' reviewing the album wrote,
{{blockquote|I thought she leaned too adult-contemporary for my tastes. Boy, was I wrong! This might be her most rockin' album to date. The album starts like a house afire: Carlile totally nails the vocal on the gospel influenced "Wherever Is Your Heart", and this one makes you realize just how good she is. When she sings, you're a believer. She'll have you singing along on the infectious "The Thing I Regret". Maybe the biggest surprise on the album is "Mainstream Kid", which shows some grit! It's as badass as Carlile has ever sounded. If you had Brandi Carlile pegged as an adult-contemporary softie, you might try again. Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins show that they aren't afraid to rock out.

==History==
===1992–2004: The Constant Ivy Music years===
[[Image:Carbon Leaf (Barry Privett) in Cleveland, OH Grog Shop.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Barry Privett]]
Carbon Leaf got their start at [[Randolph-Macon College]] in [[Virginia]] in 1992, practicing in an auditorium on campus. Their next step was playing backyard parties, mixers, fraternity, and sorority parties. Shortly after everyone graduated, they moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. From Richmond, they played the college circuit in Virginia and up the East Coast before moving on to clubs. Their style is not "Brazilian Polka Metal", despite the joking claims of guitarist Carter Gravatt (B., David. 2002).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814181900/http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm |title=Carbon Leaf Interview -Chicago, 2002 |work=Blue Tint Magazine |archive-date=August 14, 2004}}</ref>

''[[Meander (album)|Meander]]'', their first album, was released in 1995. The first songs Carbon Leaf wrote, including "One Day" and "Country Monkee", are on the album.

The producers of ''[[Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!]]'' were using an acoustic version of "Life Less Ordinary" as a placeholder in the film.

==Early life==
Canada was born in [[Pampa, Texas]], in 1976. He acquired a taste for music after attending a [[George Strait]] concert with his parents at the age of four. The next day he asked for a guitar.  Canada first started playing guitar at the age of eight. While Cody was a teen, the Canada family relocated to [[Yukon, Oklahoma]]. As a teenager Canada was drawn to rock bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pearl Jam]] and also [[outlaw country]].<ref name="allmusic" />

{{main|Cross Canadian Ragweed}}
In 1994, Canada along with fellow musicians Matt Weidemann (bass), Grady Cross (guitar), and Randy Ragsdale (percussion) formed Cross Canadian Ragweed in [[Yukon, Oklahoma]]. The band was named after the original members with Canada taking on the role of lead guitarist, lead vocals, and prominent songwriter. They would later move to [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]]. From the time of Ragweed's formation until its end in 2010, the band released seven studio albums as well as three live albums.

In 2010, the band went on an extended hiatus due to slight tensions inside the band, and Ragsdale's family responsibilities, eventually breaking up in late 2010.

They released their first album in June 2011 titled ''This Is Indian Land'', consisting of covers written by Oklahoma songwriters.

In September 2012, the band announced that they would release one song from ''Adventus'' every Monday leading up until the album's release on their Facebook artist profile.

In 2014 the band announced a third studio album.  ''Hippielovepunk'' was released on January 13, 2015.  The album debut at No. 9 on the Billboard US Country chart as well as No. 9 on the US Indie chart.  The first single was a return to the Red Dirt sound of CCR titled ''Inbetweener''.

'''Cowboy Junkies''' are an [[alternative country]] and [[folk rock]] band formed in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada in 1985 by Alan Anton (bassist), Michael Timmins (songwriter, guitarist), Peter Timmins (drummer) and [[Margo Timmins]] (vocalist).<ref name=EMC>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/cowboy-junkies|title=Cowboy Junkies|website=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102001215/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/cowboy-junkies|archive-date=January 2, 2013|access-date=April 19, 2012}}</ref> The three Timminses are siblings, and Anton worked with Michael Timmins during their first couple of bands. John Timmins was a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their debut studio album.<ref name="86 Promo sheet"/> The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their studio albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.

Cowboy Junkies' 1986 debut studio album, produced by Canadian producer [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], was the [[blues]]-inspired ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'', recorded in the family garage using a single [[Ambisonics|ambisonic]] microphone.<ref name=EMC/>

The band gained wide recognition with their second studio album, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), recorded in 1987 at Toronto's [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. Their sound, again with [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988.<ref name=EMC/> 

Cowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, with tour dates booked into 2024.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tour |url=https://cowboyjunkies.com/tour/ |website=Cowboy Junkies |access-date=24 November 2023}}</ref>

==History==
=== Early history===
Alan Anton and Michael Timmins, lifelong friends who met in kindergarten, formed their first band in high school. In 1979, influenced by [[post-punk]] bands such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], they recruited drummer Geoff Railton and vocalist Liza Dawson-Whisker, and formed Hunger Project in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |title=Whites Off Earth Now {{!}} Backstory |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=January 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117122349/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017152650/https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |title=An interview with Michael Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies |work=Little Village |date=October 23, 2013 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=McLeod, Kembrew |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-01-01-ca-236-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029134019/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |title=The Cowboy Junkies' Addicting Vision : At its best, the band plays country music with a Velvet Underground twang |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 1, 1989 |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Hilburn, Robert |url-status=live }}</ref> They moved to [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and performed at a variety of clubs. In early 1981, the Hunger Project embarked on a multi-city tour of the United States. After that, Hunger Project moved to the United Kingdom, where they toured for three months and released the single "The Same Inside/Assembly" on their independent label, [[Latent Recordings]].<ref name="86 Promo sheet">{{cite web |url=http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch:80/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511211421/http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |title=1986 promo sheet |website=palesun's Cowboy Junkies fan pages |date=May 11, 2006 |archive-date=May 11, 2006 |access-date=April 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When Hunger Project disbanded, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal. The members – Michael Timmins on guitar, Alan Anton on bass, a drummer, and saxophonist, played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time. Germinal released two studio albums: ''Germinal 1'' (1983) and ''Din'' (1984). The music newspaper [[New Musical Express]] said Germinal "ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year." Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take, saying, "It was the ultimate release for us. But for the audience, it was quite a chore."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/cowboy-junkies |title=Cowboy Junkies |website=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> In London, they developed journeyman skills as musicians, and expanded their knowledge of music history — Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal. Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[John Coltrane]], along with the sound of early blues musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bukka White]], and [[Robert Johnson]].<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984. Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York City.<ref name="86 Promo sheet"/>

Upon their return to Toronto in 1985, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house, insulated the tiny garage, and, with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums, began exploring a new musical direction. Margo was drafted to join and recalls, "I was contemplating going on to graduate school, staying in school. That was safe. I never wanted to be a musician or be onstage."<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> Nevertheless, Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams, realizing that a female voice was what the band needed. Michael Timmins said, "I thought if you had this female voice on top of it, you could do anything you wanted."<ref name="Cold Dawn"/>

However, the slow musical tempos and whispery, hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration, but came about by necessity. Their recording studio was their repurposed garage, which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours. On their first jam session, the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour.<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> According to Michael Timmins, "We realized we had to tone down. One thing fed into the other: Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet. We began to realize, if we can get down underneath Margo, the sound will be more effective. Pete picked up brushes – he was just learning to play drums at that point. Everything sort of came down. We learned to play with less volume."<ref name="Cold Dawn"/>

When the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig, the members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Cowboy Junkies: Q&A with Margo Timmins |work=The Telegraph |date=October 17, 2011 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Chilton, Martin}}{{cbignore}}</ref> During their early gigs the band would perform at [[The Rivoli]] which had a small space in the back. The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs. Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam session.<ref name="Cold Dawn"/>

[[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer, was at their first show. According to Moore, "I was mesmerized by Margo. The very first show, people weren't paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly. Margo had her back to the audience a lot of the time."<ref name="Cold Dawn">{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-cold-grey-light-dawn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915115117/https://www.nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-cold-grey-light-dawn |title=Cowboy Junkies - Cold grey light of dawn |work=No Depression |date=April 30, 2001 |archive-date=September 15, 2016 |access-date=April 26, 2018 |author=Cantin, Paul |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== 1980s ===
When the Cowboy Junkies were ready to record a studio album the band sought a like-minded recording engineer. They met Peter Moore at a dinner party, and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques, they found that Moore's interest in single-microphone recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/cowboy_junkies_reflect_on_30_y.html |title=Cowboy Junkies reflect on 30 years before Northampton show |work=Mass Live |date=April 4, 2018 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Lenker, George}}</ref> Moore had just purchased a Calrec [[Ambisonics|Ambisonic]] microphone at the wholesale price of $9,000.<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the rehearsal space on June 26, 1986, and turned the garage into a recording studio.

The Cowboy Junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they revived the indie label [[Latent Recordings]] that Michael Timmins and Anton had used for their Hunger Project and Germinal works, and released ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'' in October 1986. They sold 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Barclay, Michael |author2=Jack, Ian A.D. |author3=Schneider, Jason |year=2001 |title=Have Not Been The Same: The Canrock Renaissance, 1985-1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLIiOE_jCpAC&q=cowboy+junkies+peter+moore+1985&pg=PT528 |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781554909681 }}</ref> The band then toured the US. Michael Timmins described the experience: "While touring ''Whites'' we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy. Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |title=A Look Back At….The Trinity Session (history – part 1 of 3) |website=Latent Recordings |date=November 6, 2014 |access-date=April 4, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael |archive-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427190815/http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band's next project, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), became their breakthrough. Peter Moore again produced the album. They approached the project as a reaction against the [[MIDI]]–dominated musical styles of the '80s. Moore said, "I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI. No humanity, no nothing. I'm listening to these recordings from the '50s with two or three mics and I'm going, 'Man that's real music.'" He chose the [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, Moore claimed "The Timmins Family Singers" were recording a Christmas special.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinitysession/index8.html |title=Trinity Sessions {{!}} Page 8 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The session began early on November 27, 1987. Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first, and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo's vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the album.<ref name="Sound on Sound"/>

Music critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Anthony DeCurtis]], summed up the result of the group's efforts in a four-star review of the album: "The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song. The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective – an intense, melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic world-weariness of [[the Velvet Underground]]. [...] Having good songs, the skill to convey what they have to say and, most important, a vision, the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with high-tech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously. That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiring."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |title=Rolling Stone Review of The Trinity Session |website=Junkies Fan |date=February 9, 1989 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172429/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== 1990s ===
The band's third studio album was more challenging, requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired. Yet despite the problems with the making of it, the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' (1990) remains one of their favourite albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428093807/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their debut studio album was recorded in, instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for ''The Trinity Session'' (1988). The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired, particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold. After a few hours they realized the session wasn't working out, and they left.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] rented the [[Sharon Temple]], an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon, Ontario. Michael Timmins recalls, "The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush, unlike the spareness of most of Trinity's songs, that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didn't just turn to mush on tape. Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined. As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margo's vocal mic and feedback." At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105425/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Michael Timmins states, "When we packed up and left Sharon that day I don't think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special. It had been a difficult three days and I think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable ones."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 5|website=Latent Recordings|access-date=April 27, 2018|archive-date=April 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425023811/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the Sharon tape. As the band listened, new ideas for them evolved. They also wrote additional songs. Although the band truly loved the recordings, the songs continued to develop on stage, and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band. In 2022, however, they released the Sharon session as a special edition vinyl album as well as in streaming formats.<ref>{{cite web |title=New..Lost…Album, Sharon, Available on Vinyl |url=https://cowboyjunkies.com/tag/sharon/ |website=Cowboy Junkies official website |access-date=11 November 2022}}</ref>

At the end of the tour, they decided to go into Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto and reinvent how they recorded themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 6 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085600/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' sessions went quickly and smoothly, and were recorded over several days in December 1989. Michael Timmins believes: "The beauty of the recording and one of the reasons it remains one of our favourites is that it captures the essence of the band which magically fell together during the recording of The Trinity Session and which forged its own voice, under the glare of a very intense spotlight, in the clubs and concert halls of the world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 7 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085504/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

With their next studio album, ''[[Black Eyed Man]]'' (1992), Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts; while Margo Timmins wanted to expand her singing style and her range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express {{!}} March 1992 |website=JunkiesFan.com |access-date=June 13, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza |archive-date=July 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705100955/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to include in the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128091722/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing he needed a theme to hold the album together what Michael Timmins decided upon was "love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128072526/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band's fifth studio album, ''[[Pale Sun, Crescent Moon]]'' (1993) is a song cycle about male-female relationships. Margo Timmins describes the theme of the album as "there is love and there is all that conspires to steal love away."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/palesun_promo.html |title=Cowboy Junkies - Pale Sun, Crescent Moon promotional letter {{!}} RCA Records Label |website=Junkies Fan |date=October 1993 |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172347/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/palesun_promo.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Michael Timmins says, "It is a very dense and complex work both lyrically and musically."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/palesuncrescentmoon/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Pale Sun Crescent Moon |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=October 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012023645/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/palesuncrescentmoon/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Music critic, Mike Boehm, summed the album up this way: "By the album's end, Margo Timmins, the singer known for her preternatural hush, can be heard declaring herself with assertive bite: 'It's a (expletive) ole world, but this ole girl, well she ain't giving in.' While it hasn't exactly turned into a [[hard-rock]] band (the closely drawn, highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature of the band's style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording in an echoing church."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-07-ca-43281-story.html |title=A New Song and Dance for the Cowboy Junkies : Music: The group's 'Pale Sun, Crescent Moon' takes a more aggressive approach than the albums that gave the band its signature hushed sound. |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 7, 1994 |access-date=April 27, 2018 |author=Boehm, Mike}}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies' sixth studio album, ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'' (1996), was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of Toronto and away from usual routines, so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from Toronto, but would feel remote. Alan Anton recalls, "We found Rock Island, named not for music but for geology. It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace. We went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood, cooking, boating, whittling, hiking and staring into the fire, worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the setting."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 1 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327204456/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> When the Junkies went to record the songs, they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could "find a studio which would approximate the vibe of Rock Island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland." They found a big-porched southern house in [[Athens, Georgia]] that fit their needs. The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995. The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but state-of-the-art studio, and the band settled in quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 3|website=Latent Recordings|access-date=April 28, 2018|archive-date=February 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203191541/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies' last studio album of the decade is an [[alternative country]] album, ''[[Miles from Our Home]]'' (1998). Wanting to repeat the process of writing and creating used for ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'', Michael Timmins found a house near a [[gristmill]] on a pond, a couple hours drive from Toronto, where he spent six months writing songs. During that time, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down to work on songs. Then Michael wrote more, until the songs were worked out and ready to record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |title=Miles From Our Home {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 13, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227103329/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> On New Year's Day in 1997, just as Timmins was planning the album, the band heard that [[Townes Van Zandt]] had died. Van Zandt was a friend of the band, had toured with them in their bus in 1990, and was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael. On the day that Michael Timmins had heard that Van Zandt had died he wrote the first draft of "Blue Guitar", "as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/ |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Miles From Our Home |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref>

=== 2000s ===
Throughout their career, Cowboy Junkies have approached each studio album to see where they can change or improve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express |website=Junkies Fan |date=March 1992 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza |archive-date=July 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705100955/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Open (Cowboy Junkies album)|Open]]'', which was released on May 15, 2001,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r530810/review |title=Open - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> follows in that tradition. While they were on a tour to support their live album ''[[Waltz Across America]]'', which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule, they began working on new material. They added two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing the songs to evolve on stage. During breaks, they would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith's studio, Chemical Sound, to live record material they had created.  Being able to set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an album's worth of songs in a set recording period. On each visit, they would record two or three songs. They also took the opportunity to re-record songs. After the band had recorded fifteen tracks, they listened and decided they had the songs they needed, with two additional songs recorded at [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]]'s home studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Open |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327204516/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[One Soul Now]]'' (2004) was recorded over the course of a year, from October 2002 to October 2003. Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected. When the band returned home after their Open Tour, they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed The Clubhouse. This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |title=Cowboy Junkies One Soul Now |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709235334/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies next project was ''[[Early 21st Century Blues]]'', which was recorded February through March 2005, and released in August of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r787136 |title=Early 21st Century Blues - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> It was begun a few months after their previous tour. The theme for the album was war, violence, fear, greed, ignorance, or loss, and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people. This album was unique in that John Timmins recorded with his siblings, playing guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/21century/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Early 21st Century Blues |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710001553/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/21century/main_content.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[At the End of Paths Taken]]'' was released on April 9, 2007. Michael Timmins wrote songs that "reflect the complex, frustrating, edifying, and conflict-ridden web of relationships that constitute the family, from nuclear to extended to global. He is a parent, and a son with aging parents. He plays with his siblings in the Cowboy Junkies."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/at-the-end-of-paths-taken-mw0000479835|title=At the End of Paths Taken - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Jurek, Thom}}</ref> Timmins blends his alternative country music sound with ferocious guitar work on "My Little Basquiat" and "Mountain". At times Timmins sounds as if he has lost control of his guitar playing, "until you realize there's not a stray note to be found. . . . Timmons' [sic] guitar playing has grown more aggressive over the years."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-cowboy-junkies-at-the-end-of-paths-taken-2496247883.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: At the End of Paths Taken |work=PopMatters |date=June 5, 2007 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Gilstrap, Andrew}}</ref>

For the twentieth anniversary of their breakthrough studio album, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), the Cowboy Junkies reinterpreted the album to highlight what twenty years of performing experience brought to the songs. In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies, and whose work and lives were affected by the album. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], and [[Ryan Adams]]. Each does lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Merchant on "To Love Is to Bury", Chesnutt on "Postcard Blues", and Adams on "200 More Miles"). They also perform on other tracks. Jeff Bird, a [[session musician]] who has appeared on virtually every Cowboy Junkies album, is also included in the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Trinity Revisited |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709214735/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> In order to create the same atmosphere, they kept rehearsal to a minimum, getting together for a few hours a day before the recording. The guest musicians worked with the band to re-imagine the songs, making suggestions, trying out fresh nuances. The album contains a performance film, ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', and a documentary film, ''Trinity Session Revisited''. Directors Pierre and François Lamoureux, produced and recorded the album and the films. Although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album, the directors placed the musicians in a circle and used a surround microphone, augmented the recording with ten close-mics to record them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/cowboy-junkies-go-back-church-365949 |title=Cowboy Junkies Go Back to Church |work=Mix |date=February 1, 2008 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Jackson, Blair}}</ref>

=== 2010s ===
''[[The Nomad Series]]'' (2017) is a set of four studio albums that was released over three years from 2010 to 2012. ''The Nomad Series'' is not based on a particular theme regarding music, but are based on a set of paintings by their friend, artist [[Enrique Martinez Celaya]]. The group found the name appropriate, since they have been touring for over 30 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/136596-become-what-you-are-a-conversation-with-cowboy-junkies-michael-timmi/ |title=Become What You Are: A Conversation with Cowboy Junkies' Michael Timmins |work=PopMatters |date=February 15, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Henderson, Stuart}}</ref> The Junkies had no recording contract when they created ''the Nomad Series'', which freed them up to be experimental with their music, to avoid categorizing the planned releases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/wilderness-cowboy-junkies |title=The Wilderness by The Cowboy Junkies |work=No Depression |date=March 1, 2012 |access-date=April 29, 2018 |author=Heselgrave, Doug}}</ref>

The first album in the series is ''[[Renmin Park (album)|Renmin Park]]'' (2010), which is based on ideas the band's principal songwriter, Michael Timmins, got while living in China for three months with his wife and three children. Two of his children were adopted from China, and during their stay they visited the birth village of his adopted daughters. Most of their time was spent in [[Jingjiang]], situated on the [[Yangtze]] River about two hours' drive from [[Shanghai]].<ref name="Renmin Park">{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |title=Renmin Park |website=Latent Recordings |date=March 2010 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael |archive-date=April 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429155137/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The music that inspired Timmins most during the visit was found at Renmin Park, where a variety of musicians would gather throughout the day, bringing their erhus, pipas, shangxians, various percussion instruments; and a mix of singers performed. Timmins found most of the musicians outstanding, he thought the singers were good because they all performed with passion. About halfway through the visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and became Timmins' friend. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene.<ref name="Renmin Park"/>

Michael asked his brother, Peter Timmins, to send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, and to use his imagination. The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart.

On December 25, 2009, at the age of 45, Cowboy Junkies friend, [[Vic Chesnutt]], died from an overdose of [[muscle relaxant]]s. Chesnutt was generally a friendly and cheerful man, but he sometimes suffered bouts of severe depression.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2009/12/vic_chesnutt_in_coma_1.html |title=Singer-Songwriter Vic Chesnutt Has Died |work=NPR Music |date=December 25, 2009 |access-date=June 20, 2018 |author=Hilton, Robin}}</ref> ''[[Demons (Cowboy Junkies album)|Demons]]'', released January 18, 2011, is the Cowboy Junkies tribute to him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.com/2011/01/exclusive-cowboy-junkies-cover-vic-chesnutt/|title=Exclusive: Cowboy Junkies Cover Vic Chesnutt |work=Spin |date=January 14, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> The band had included him in their twentieth anniversary celebration of ''The Trinity Session'' when they made ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'' (2007). Chesnutt sang lead vocals on the song, "Postcard Blues." He had also toured with the group several times, starting with the tour supporting ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'' (1996). Michael Timmins stated, "One of the hopes of this album is that it inspires people to seek out the originals and keep his music alive. We had intended to do an album where he would write the songs, and we would be the band. Now we're trying to fulfil a bit of that desire."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/arts/music/17junkies.html |title=Cowboy Junkies Release 'Demons' |work=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Belcher, David}}</ref> The Cowboy Junkies  managed to turn an album born from grief into an assertion of life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thehurstreview.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/cowboy-junkies-demons/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301224523/https://thehurstreview.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/cowboy-junkies-demons/ |title=Cowboy Junkies: "Demons" |work=The Hurst Review |date=February 25, 2011 |archive-date=March 1, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Hurst, Josh}}</ref>

On October 14, 2011, music critic Jason Lent began his review of ''[[Sing in My Meadow]]'' with this observation, "When [[R.E.M.]] called it quits, the band talked about walking away having maintained their artistic integrity throughout a 30-year career. As Cowboy Junkies pass the quarter century mark, the Toronto band must rest well at night. The band's consistent work flies under the radar more times than not and the band sounds content with keeping it that way." He continues, "One of the band's live staples in recent years is "Hunted" from 1994's ''Pale Sun Crescent Moon''. Revisiting the song here, the original sounds frail and timid in comparison. Margo belts out the lyrics with the dry bitterness of someone who has witnessed first-hand the arrows that fly between men and women. As the band shakes the rafters, Bird delivers a mandolin solo that redefines the possibilities of the instrument."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-sing-my-meadow-review |title=Cowboy Junkies - Sing In My Meadow (Review) |work=No Depression |date=October 14, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Lent, Jason |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909112334/http://nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-sing-my-meadow-review |archive-date=September 9, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[The Wilderness (Cowboy Junkies album)|The Wilderness]]'' was released on March 27, 2012,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-wilderness-the-nomad-series-vol-4-mw0002310883 |title=The Wilderness: The Nomad Series, Vol. 4 - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 29, 2018}}</ref> and is the fourth and final entry of ''The Nomad Series''. The album reflects the introspective nature of winter. The album is a return to the folk vibe the band played with in the late 80s and early 90s. Songwriter Michael Timmins states: "I started to think in terms of an album of songs reflecting on the lives of characters I'd written about early in the bands career and bringing those characters . . . into the future to see where their lives were at now." About his lyrics, Timmins says: "Some of those songs have little touch points where . . . you can see how they connect to earlier songs -- even character's names and stuff pops into them, and that's intentional."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/502669/cowboy-junkies-getting-back-to-the-folk-vibe-on-the-wilderness |title=Cowboy Junkies Getting Back To 'The Folk Vibe' on 'The Wilderness' |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=March 8, 2012 |access-date=June 21, 2018 |author=Graff, Gary}}</ref> The style of the songs on the album comes closer to the typical Cowboy Junkies music, more than the other albums in ''The Nomad series''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/cowboy_junkies-wilderness_2|title=Cowboy Junkies The Wilderness|website=exclaim.ca|access-date=April 29, 2018}}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies studio album, ''[[All That Reckoning]]'', was released on July 13, 2018. In an interview about the upcoming album with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', guitarist and songwriter Michael Timmins said, "There's a lot of pressures and a lot of crumbling of institutions, very little foundation to put one's feet on again, especially at an older age. You sort of expect things to be there and realize, 'My God, what I thought was a standard, whether it be an institution or a way of dealing with people in our society, is disappearing."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8421364/cowboy-junkies-all-that-reckoning-premiere |title=Cowboy Junkies Return With 'All That Reckoning,' Title Track From New Album: Premiere |magazine=Billboard |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=May 10, 2018 |author=Graff, Gary}}</ref> In 2019, they joined the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Volmers |first1=Eric |title=Chilliwack, Andy Kim, Cowboy Junkies, Bobby Curtola honoured in first Canadian Music Hall of Fame induction ceremony |url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/local-arts/chilliwack-andy-kim-cowboy-junkies-bobby-curtola-honoured-in-first-canadian-music-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony |access-date=11 December 2022 |work=Calgary Herald |date=27 October 2019}}</ref>

=== Concerts and television performances ===
Michael Timmins states that "By the Spring of 1990 we had been on the road for close to two years straight, trying to stay right-side-up in the whirlwind of attention that was created by the release of ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988) and the subsequent release of ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' (1990). We had accumulated, literally, trunks full of press clippings from around the world, but most importantly we had built up our confidence on stage. Margo was emerging as a true front-person and we were gelling as band. In May of that year we landed in the London for our first full fledge UK tour and were greeted with much adulation and interest. The tour was a tremendous success on all levels and thankfully the [[BBC]] was there to record one of the shows at [[Royal Exchange, Manchester#Theatre|The Royal Exchange Theatre]] in [[Manchester]]."<ref>{{cite web |author=Timmins |first=Michael |title=Cowboy Junkies :: In The Time Before Llamas |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/llamas/main_content.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429155919/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/llamas/main_content.html |archive-date=April 29, 2018 |access-date=April 29, 2018 |website=Latent Recordings}}</ref>

'''Cross Canadian Ragweed''' was an American rock band formed in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]] in 1994. The band consisted of [[Cody Canada]] (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), [[Randy Ragsdale]] (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released five studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010.

==History==
===Formation===
Cross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale met Cody Canada, Matt Weidemann, and Grady Cross, who had also been playing together. The four had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale's home seven nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale's father, Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member's last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Matt Weidemann left the band, and Jeremy Plato joined the band, playing the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the [[College Town]] of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], where acts like Mike McClure's [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]] and singer-songwriter [[Jimmy LaFave]] had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/north_austin_stillwater_ok_nickname/|title=Barry Popik|website=Barrypopik.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>

===''Carney'' and ''Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon''===
The group had already received significant [[college radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] before it released its first album, ''Carney'' in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base's passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released ''Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon'' in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene.

===''Highway 377''===
Ragweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into [[Texas]], where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song "Long Way Home" was featured on several [[Dodge]] Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale's father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track "Johnny's Song."

===''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas''===
In 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album ''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas'' in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off ''Carney'' and ''Highway 377'', with a handful of cover songs.

===''Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)''===
In 2002, the group then signed with [[Show Dog Nashville|Universal South]] Records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as 'The Purple Album'.  It was a tribute to the band's "little sister" Mandy Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band's drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near [[College Station, Texas]], and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles "17" and the ballad "Constantly", and released a music video for the hard rock track "Don't Need You."

===''Soul Gravy''===
Ragweed's 2004 album, ''[[Soul Gravy]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard charts. [[Lee Ann Womack]] provided background vocals on the popular single "Sick and Tired". The project also saw the re-release of the song "Alabama" (off of 2001's Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]] as well.

===''Garage''===
In October 2005 the band released ''Garage'', described by both the band and raters at [[AllMusic]] as the group's "grungiest album ever." Two songs, "Fighting' For" and "This Time Around" both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States due to the song "Dimebag", a tribute to former [[Damageplan]] and [[Pantera]] guitarist "Dimebag" [[Darrell Abbott]], who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall.

===''Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain's Ballroom''===
In late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, ''Live and Loud At Cain's Ballroom'' in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The band's 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as [[Neil Young]]'s [[The Needle and the Damage Done]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]]'s "Lonely Feeling."

===''Mission California''===
Cross Canadian Ragweed recorded ''[[Mission California]]'', their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in [[San Diego]], California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. [[Lee Ann Womack]] once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] cover "Cry Lonely." ''[[Mission California]]'' was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was "name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock."

===''Happiness and All the Other Things''===
The band's tenth and final album, ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled "51 Pieces", which Canada penned with Micky Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the [[House of Blues]]. It also featured "Blue Bonnets" which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke ([[Willie Nelson]]'s long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were "To Find My Love", "Burn Like The Sun", and "Kick In The Head."

=== Hiatus and band break-up ===
In May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring.  In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, "Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He's 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home." Despite Ragsdale wanting to "get another drummer and press on," Canada stated "We’ve always said from the start, we’re Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all."<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cross Canadian Ragweed cancels Oklahoma City Family Jam  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701165713/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |archive-date=July 1, 2012  }}</ref> In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their  "Last Call Show" in October 2010 at Joe's Bar in Chicago, IL, stating "as far as that’s concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/news/2010/sep/16/cross-canadian-ragweed-frontmans-career-evolves/|title=Cross Canadian Ragweed frontman's career evolves|website=Caller.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>

=== Post break-up ===
Since Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed [[The Departed (band)|The Departed]] with fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]]-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album "This Is Indian Land" in June 2011.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cody Canada & The Departed digging into red dirt roots with debut album, "This Is Indian Land"  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707211521/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |archive-date=July 7, 2012  }}</ref>
Ragsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon. Ragsdale played with Stoney LaRue until 2013 and now works in the oil and natural gas industry, while Cross purchased and operates the bar that was the very first venue Cross Canadian Ragweed performed in 1994.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Local musician puts family first with new business  |url=http://www.mustangpaper.com/v2/content.aspx?module=ContentItem&ID=186897&MemberID=1586  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317125018/http://www.mustangpaper.com/v2/content.aspx?module=ContentItem&ID=186897&MemberID=1586  |url-status=dead  |archive-date=March 17, 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oklahoman.com/story/entertainment/2011/07/07/fomer-cross-canadian-ragweed-rocker-returns-to-his-roots-with-opening-of-yukon-pub/61151918007/|title={{as written|Fomer}} Cross Canadian Ragweed rocker returns to his roots with opening of Yukon pub|date=July 7, 2011|website=Oklahoman.com|access-date=August 12, 2024}}</ref>

In 2019 Grady Cross and Randy Ragsdale joined singer-songwriter Jason Young to form the band Cross Rags and Young.

==Influences and sound==
The band was influenced by [[grunge]], [[alternative rock]] of the 1990s along with early [[southern rock]] acts as well as [[outlaw country]]. Canada said that rock bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Soundgarden]] all were a part of the influence on the band's sound as well as country music influences [[Merle Haggard]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Robert Earl Keen]], in addition to southern rockers [[Marshall Tucker Band]], and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], among others. Due to their unique sound, the band often had a hard time getting radio airplay on either mainstream rock or country stations.

==Notable appearances==
The band frequently played with other stars of the [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] and Texas Music scene including [[Stoney Larue]], [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers]], [[Micky & The Motorcars]], [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly]], (Canada's brother-in-law) [[Wade Bowen]], [[No Justice]], Johnny Cooper, Seth James, and [[Brandon Rhyder]].

The band played with country music star [[Dierks Bentley]] numerous times. Bentley referenced the band in his song "[[Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)]]", singing that "Ragweed's rockin' on the radio".

[[Minnesota Twins]] [[catcher]] [[Ryan Doumit]] comes to bat to their song "Alabama".

"Cry Lonely" is a playable track in ''[[Rock Band Country Track Pack]]''.

The song "Boys from Oklahoma" plays as the credits roll in the movie [[Leaves of Grass (film)|Leaves of Grass]] starring [[Edward Norton]] and [[Susan Sarandon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1151359/soundtrack|title=Leaves of Grass (2009) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref> The film is a Stoner Comedy set in Oklahoma.

"Anywhere But Here" is played during the Season 2 Episode 6 of the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]''.

'''Dallas Hendry Smith''' (born December 4, 1977) is a Canadian singer and songwriter, who performs both as a solo [[country music]] artist and as lead singer for the [[hard rock]] band [[Default (band)|Default]]. He is currently signed to [[Big Loud Records]]. Smith is the current record holder of most number one hits among all male Canadian artists on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Canada Country]] chart, at eleven. With ''[[Side Effects (Dallas Smith album)|Side Effects]]'', Smith also became the first Canadian country artist in the Nielsen BDS era to chart four consecutive number one singles from one album ([[Shania Twain]] charted three consecutive number one hits from her 1997 release ''[[Come On Over]]''), a feat he would then top with his next album, ''[[Timeless (Dallas Smith album)|Timeless]]''.

At the end of 2012, [[Mediabase]] named Smith the most played Canadian country act and number eight overall at the format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdf.mediabase.com/YearEnd12/YearEnd12Canada.pdf |title=Year end |publisher=pdf.mediabase.com |date=2012 |access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>

==Music career==
===Early career===
Dallas Smith always had a passion for music growing up. Some of his main influences were [[The Beatles]] and female country singers [[Reba McEntire]] and [[The Judds]]. Due to his shyness, Smith was reluctant to express his musical talent until he made the decision to face his fear and play cover songs with a band consisting of some of his friends. He signed his first record deal when he was 21.<ref>{{cite web|author=Krissie|title=Dallas Smith - December's "Artist on the Rise|url=http://countrymusicmatters.com/2013/12/dallas-smith-decembers-artist-on-the-rise/|publisher=CMM|access-date=2014-03-12}}</ref>

===1999–2009: Default===
{{Main|Default (band)}}
Before his solo career, Smith was the lead singer of multi-platinum band [[Default (band)|Default]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[hard rock]]/[[post-grunge]] band from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Formed in 1999, it continued until 2013. Default's debut 2001 album, ''[[The Fallout (Default album)|The Fallout]]'', achieved instant success due to strong radio play of "[[Wasting My Time (Default song)|Wasting My Time]]" and "[[Deny (Default song)|Deny]]". In 2002 Default won the [[Juno Award]] for "Best New Group". On April 30, 2003, the record achieved a [[platinum album]] [[RIAA certification]], signifying a million records sold.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Default%20&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 RIAA Database]</ref> The band also released the album ''[[Elocation]]'' (2003) which was certified gold, ''[[One Thing Remains]]'' (2005) and ''[[Comes and Goes]]'' (2009).

===2011–2012: ''Jumped Right In'' and Boys of Fall Tour===
''[[Jumped Right In]]'' was released on May 22, 2012, via [[604 Records]] under the production of [[Joey Moi]].<ref name="chiefmusicmanagement.com">{{cite news|title=Dallas Smith debut country solo album "Jumped Right In" will be released May 22|url=http://chiefmusicmanagement.com/dallas-smith-debut-country-solo-album-jumped-right-in-will-be-released-may-22|access-date=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Chief Music Management|date=March 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230615/http://chiefmusicmanagement.com/dallas-smith-debut-country-solo-album-jumped-right-in-will-be-released-may-22|archive-date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> The album features tracks written by Smith along with Moi, [[Rodney Clawson]], [[Craig Wiseman]], [[Dustin Lynch]], [[Chris Tompkins]], Zac Maloy, [[Chad Kroeger]] and more.

In March 2013, Smith went on a sold-out Canadian tour with [[Bob Seger]].

Stemming from the success of the Boys of Fall Tour, Smith and Brownlee teamed up to create the annual Boys of Fall Charity Golf Tournament and Concert. The tournament took place at the Redwoods Golf Course in [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley, British Columbia]] on August 27, 2013, and was sponsored by the radio station [[CJJR-FM|JRfm]].

'''David Albert Alvin''' (born November 11, 1955) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer. He is a former and founding member of the [[roots rock]] band [[the Blasters]]. Alvin has recorded and performed as a solo artist since the late 1980s and has been involved in various side projects and collaborations. He has had brief stints as a member of the bands [[X (U.S. band)|X]] and [[the Knitters]]. He often refers to himself as "Blackjack Dave," in reference to his 1998 album and song of the same name.

== Early life ==
Alvin grew up in [[Downey, California]]. He and his older brother, [[Phil Alvin]], as teenagers frequented [[blues]], [[rockabilly]] and [[country music]] venues.<ref name="All Music bio">Deming, Mark. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dave-alvin-mn0000679219/biography Dave Alvin: Biography].

== Career ==
=== With the Blasters ===
In 1979, Alvin and his brother Phil formed the roots-rock band [[The Blasters]] with fellow Downey residents [[Bill Bateman (drummer)|Bill Bateman]] and [[John Bazz]].<ref name="All Music bio" /><ref name="Blasters bio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-blasters-mn0000757177/biography | title=Artist Biography: The Blasters | publisher=AllMusic.com | author=Sullivan, Denise | author-link=Denise Sullivan }}</ref> Alvin served as the group's lead guitarist and chief songwriter.<ref name="Blasters bio" /> ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' noted the ever-increasing numbers of originals that Alvin wrote for the Blasters, along with his maturation into a great songwriter.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Rough Guide to Rock | publisher=Rough Guides | editor1=Buckley, Peter|editor2=Buckley, Jonathan| year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 106] | isbn=978-1-85828-457-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 }}</ref>

Other artists have covered Alvin's songs. For example, "[[Marie Marie]]" became a British-German top 20 hit in 1980 for [[Shakin' Stevens]] and received a [[zydeco]] treatment in 1987 from [[Buckwheat Zydeco]]. [[Dwight Yoakam]] recorded "Long White Cadillac" in 1989.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin was in the original lineup until 1986. His departure reflected internal tension in the band, but ultimately he wanted to sing his own songs while his brother [[Phil Alvin]] was the established lead vocalist for the group.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article36306066.html |author=Sculley, Alan |title=Alvin brothers: Losing no more time playing apart |work=Sacramento Bee |date=September 23, 2015 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

Alvin has rejoined the Blasters for some reunion tours and live albums with the original lineup. He has also occasionally performed with the band under other circumstances as well.<ref name="rosen">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/entertainment/tn-blr-1216-the-blasters-frontman-phil-alvin-takes-to-the-stage-new-years-eve-after-a-scary-2012-story.html |author=Rosen, Craig |title=The Blasters' frontman Phil Alvin takes to the stage New Year's Eve after a scary 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 15, 2012 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== With X and the Knitters ===
Alvin served a brief stint as the lead guitarist of the Los Angeles–based [[alternative rock]] band [[X (American band)|X]]. He left X in 1987 to work on a solo project after the group recorded their album ''[[See How We Are]]''.

Alvin was also a member of the [[country folk]] band [[The Knitters]], an offshoot of X. He appeared on their 1985 album  ''Poor Little Critter on the Road'' and their 2005 follow-up, ''The Modern Sounds of the Knitters''.<ref name="All Music bio" />

=== With the Flesh Eaters ===
In the early 1980s, Alvin, along with fellow Blasters members Bill Bateman and [[Steve Berlin]], performed on ''[[A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (album)|A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die]]'' by the Los Angeles [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[the Flesh Eaters]]. This lineup, which also included [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] and [[D.J. Bonebrake]], assembled once again in 2006, performing three shows in California and one in England to mark the album's 25th anniversary. They reunited briefly in 2015 for a five-show tour and again for an eight-show run in 2018. They issued a new album, ''[[I Used to Be Pretty]]'', in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://americanahighways.org/2019/03/19/show-review-flesh-eaters-rock-dcs-union-stage-with-porcupine/ |author=Cook, Glenn. |title=Show Review: Flesh Eaters Rock DC's Union Stage With Porcupine |work=Americana Highways |date=March 19, 2019 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>

=== Solo ===
[[File:Dave Alvin.jpg|thumb|Alvin in 2007]]
Alvin's first solo album, ''Romeo's Escape'' (entitled ''Every Night About This Time'' in England), was released in 1987. It was well received by critics but did not sell well. Because of the album's low sales, Alvin's recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] was terminated. He then toured with [[Mojo Nixon]] and [[Beat Farmers|Country Dick Montana]], billed as the Pleasure Barons; an album recorded live on their 1993 tour was released.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin's second solo album, ''Blue Blvd'', was released by [[Hightone Records]] in 1991. It received positive reviews and had moderate sales. His album ''Museum of Heart'' was released in 1993. He recorded ''[[King of California (album)|King of California]]'', an album of [[acoustic music]], in 1994. In 2000, he recorded the album ''[[Public Domain (album)|Public Domain: Songs From the Wild Land]]'', a collection of traditional folk and blues classics, which earned him a [[Grammy]] award for Best Contemporary [[Folk music|Folk]] Album.<ref name="All Music bio" />

In 2011, Alvin recorded the album ''[[Eleven Eleven (Dave Alvin album)|Eleven Eleven]]'', released by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The album marked his return to rock roots.<ref name="rs">{{cite magazine|last=Scherman|first=Tony|title=Dave Alvin: Eleven Eleven|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 21, 2011|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/eleven-eleven-20110621}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in a review of the album, called Alvin "an underrecognized guitar hero".<ref name="rs" />

=== Further recordings with Phil Alvin ===
In 2014, Dave and Phil Alvin, as a duo, released the album ''Common Ground'', consisting of their versions of songs by [[Big Bill Broonzy]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5908507/the-blasters-dave-phil-alvin-talk-common-ground-album-premiere-all-by-myself-song-listen-exclusive | title=Dave Alvin & Phil Alvin Talk 'Common Ground' Album, Premiere 'All By Myself' Song: Listen Exclusively | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=February 19, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Gallo, Phil}}</ref> It was the first studio collaboration of the brothers since the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-torn-up-band-of-brothers-finally-on-the-mend-1401411544 | title=A Torn-Up Band of Brothers, Finally on the Mend | work=[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] | date=May 29, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Dougherty, Steve}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-alvin-brothers-20140608-story.html#page=1 | title=Dave and Phil Alvin, Former Blasters Mates, Resurrect Partnership | work=Los Angeles Times | date=June 6, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Lewis, Randy}}</ref> In 2015 they released ''Lost Time'', a collection of covers including four songs by [[Big Joe Turner]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dave Alvin: Return of the Battlin' Brothers|page=24|date=March 2016|newspaper=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|last=Cohen|first=Elliot Stephen}}</ref>

In live performance, Alvin assumed the role of emcee and storyteller. The brothers also worked Blasters tunes into the set list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elmoremagazine.com/2016/09/reviews/shows/dave-and-phil-alvin-and-the-guilty-ones |title=Dave and Phil Alvin and the Guilty Ones |work=Elmore Magazine |date=September 9, 2016 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== With Jimmie Dale Gilmore ===
Alvin and Texas singer-songwriter [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] teamed on the 2018 album ''Downey to Lubbock'' (the title is a reference to where each man grew up).

As seen in his live performances with brother Phil, Alvin's stories between songs were a notable part of the stage shows with Gilmore and their supporting musicians.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://glidemagazine.com/214083/dave-alvin-and-jimmie-dale-gilmore-prove-perfect-collaborators-in-portland-show-review-photos/ |author=Ferguson, Neil |title=Dave Alvin and Jimmie Dale Gilmore Prove Perfect Collaborators in Portland |work=Glide Magazine |date=October 1, 2018 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

In April 2022, Alvin announced his return to public performance after a grueling two-year battle with different forms of cancer that started in May 2020. He chose to do so with Gilmore, scheduling nine dates in California for late June and early July 2022.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/dave-alvin-cancer-interview-1336284/ |author=Bernstein, Jonathan |title='I Should Have Died': Dave Alvin, Seminal California Country-Punk Guitarist, Talks Private Cancer Battle |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2022 |access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>

Alvin has lent his guitar playing to other artists' albums over the years. For example, he played with [[the Gun Club]] and appeared on two songs from their 1984 album, ''[[The Las Vegas Story (album)|The Las Vegas Story]]''<ref name="All Music bio" />

=== Film ===
Alvin appeared in the movies ''[[Border Radio]]'' and  ''Floundering'' and on the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] television series ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]'' in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/music/dave-alvin-lives-to-tell-about-his-justified-stint/article_2a4bc144-1a84-5f8e-a214-68990bc1b66b.html|title = Dave Alvin lives to tell about his 'Justified' stint|website=Stltoday.com| date=May 31, 2013 }}</ref> He also appeared in ''[[Streets of Fire]]'', with the Blasters, in 1984.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0023568/#actor | title=Dave Alvin: Filmography | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb.com]]}}</ref>

Review'', ''Rattler'', ''Asymptote'' and ''Enclitic'' and in the [[anthologies]] ''Nude Erections'', ''Hit and Run Poets'' and ''Poetry Loves Poetry—An Anthology of Los Angeles Poets''.

A collection of Alvin's writing called ''New Highway'' was scheduled for release in September 2022. Its subtitle -- Selected Lyrics, Poems, Prose, Essays, Eulogies and Blues -- described the scope of his work.

Growing up in the [[St. Norbert, Winnipeg|St. Norbert]] neighbourhood of Winnipeg,<ref name=bioand2015junos/> he took up the guitar.  By the time he was sixteen, he was writing music and performing in different bands.<ref name=bioand2015junos/>  One summer, after working to save up money, he recorded the songs he had written.<ref name=bioand2015junos/>  This was first glimpse of Del writing and producing his own music. After his first self recording became a hit among his friends, they encouraged and convinced him to play a live show.<ref name=bioand2015junos/>  Despite his early success, Barber was doubtful about this being a viable career choice.<ref name=bioand2015junos/>  But as he finished school and moved on to college, he would continue with music.

===''The Puck Drops Here'' and ''Easy Keeper'' (2016-2019)===
With ''Prairieography'' being dubbed as what could have been a career-making opus, Barber moved from Winnipeg to a farm in rural Manitoba to begin work on a follow-up album.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

On April 15, 2016; Barber along with the No Regretzkys released ''The Puck Drops Here'' through True North Records.<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/del_barber_and_the_no_regretzkys_lace_up_for_hockey-themed_lp_shoot_out_new_single|title=Del Barber & the No Regretzkys Lace Up for Hockey-themed LP, Shoot Out New Single|last=Murphy|first=Sarah|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>  With Barber being a hockey fan, this was a hockey themed album with distinct rock and country sounds.  Barber was in contact with True North sending them demos of songs he had been working on, but received no feedback.  Those songs would later be put on the album that would become ''Easy Keeper''. After not getting any feedback on those demos, Barber had the idea for a hockey themed album as it was never done before.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

It features covers of well-known songs such as [[Stompin' Tom Connors]]'s "[[The Hockey Song]]," ''Coach's Corner'' segment of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' theme "Flame of Victory," and [[Tom Cochrane]]'s "[[Big League (song)|Big League]]."  It also features covers of lesser known songs such as [[The Hanson Brothers]]' "Hockey Night Tonight" and [[The Pursuit of Happiness (band)|Pursuit of Happiness]]' "Gretzky Rocks."  Barber added some originals including "Hudson Bay Rules" and the single off the album "The Lights Go Out."<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere/>  The album was produced by [[Corb Lund]] guitarist Grant Siemens.<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere/>

Barber's refusal to promote the album led to tensions between himself and the label.  He was subsequently dropped by True North and his agent as a result.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

On June 10, 2018; Barber started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to raise money for his next album entitled ''Easy Keeper.''.<ref name=easykeeperkickstarter>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/248696342/easy-keeper-del-barbers-new-album/|title="Easy Keeper" - Del Barber's New Album!|date=June 10, 2018|work=Del Barber|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>  He stated that he took a hiatus and was now wanting to produce a new album.

<blockquote>"I wrote it before my dad passed—before he was even sick, but it became an anthem for me in the months after his passing.

"Looking back, I feel like this song was a gift from [my dad]."<ref name=thecountrynote/></blockquote>

He recorded the album at No Fun Club in Winnipeg.  It took one week to record the album with Grant Siemens and Scott Franchuk.<ref name=thecountrynote/>

<blockquote>"It was a really beautiful session.  There were no grand intentions, just an aim to get good players and friends together and record a pile of my songs. Going into this session I really wanted to enjoy the process, not think too hard, and just keep it simple and honest. I had a group of great songs and I really didn't want to stand in their way."<ref name=thecountrynote/></blockquote>

'''Dwight David Yoakam''' (born October 23, 1956) is an American [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter, actor, and filmmaker. He first achieved mainstream attention in 1986 with the release of his debut album ''[[Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.]]''. Yoakam had considerable success throughout the late 1980s onward, with a total of ten studio albums for [[Reprise Records]]. Later projects have been released on Audium (now [[MNRK Music Group]]), [[New West Records|New West]], [[Warner Records|Warner]], and [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]].

His first three albums{{mdash}}''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'', ''[[Hillbilly Deluxe (Dwight Yoakam album)|Hillbilly Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room]]''{{mdash}}all reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart. Yoakam also has two number-one singles on [[Hot Country Songs]] with "[[Streets of Bakersfield]]" (a duet with [[Buck Owens]]) and "[[I Sang Dixie]]", and twelve additional top-ten hits. He has won two [[Grammy Award]]s and one [[Academy of Country Music]] award. 1993's ''[[This Time (Dwight Yoakam album)|This Time]]'' is his most commercially successful album, having been [[music recording sales certification|certified]] triple-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

Yoakam's musical style draws from a wide variety of influences including [[alternative country]], [[neotraditional country]], [[honky-tonk]], [[Rock music|rock]] and the [[Bakersfield sound]]. He is known for his distinctive tenor singing voice, unconventional musical image, and the lead guitar work of his longtime producer and bandleader [[Pete Anderson]]. Yoakam writes most of his own songs but has recorded many successful [[cover song]]s by a wide range of artists including [[Johnny Horton]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[The Blasters]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He has collaborated with [[Beck]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Ralph Stanley]], and members of [[Alison Krauss & Union Station]].

As an actor, Yoakam has appeared in the movies ''[[Red Rock West]]'', ''[[Sling Blade]]'', ''[[Panic Room]]'', ''[[The Minus Man]]'', and ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', as well as ''[[South of Heaven, West of Hell]]'', which he wrote and directed. He also appeared in the TV series ''[[P.S. I Luv U]]'' and ''[[Under the Dome (TV series)|Under the Dome]]'', as well as the [[Amazon Prime Video]] original series ''[[Goliath (TV series)|Goliath]]''.

==Biography==
[[File:Main at Grace in Pikeville.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Dwight Yoakam was born in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]].|alt=A view of buildings along a street in Pikeville, Kentucky.]]
Dwight David Yoakam was born October 23, 1956, in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]].<ref name="whitburn"/><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography | title=Dwight Yoakam biography | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 2, 2022 | author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]}}</ref> He is the oldest of three children to David Yoakam and his wife, Ruth Ann Tibbs Yoakam. At the time of Yoakam's birth, his father was serving in the [[United States Army]].<ref name="roots">{{cite web | url=https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/2019/10/21/from-archives-dwight-yoakam-s/2482742007/ | title=From the Archives: Dwight Yoakam's Columbus Roots | publisher=Columbus Monthly | date=October 21, 2019 | access-date=September 2, 2022 | author=Eric Lyttle}}</ref> After David Yoakam was discharged from the Army, the Yoakams moved to [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref name="virgin">{{cite book | title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music | publisher=Virgin Books | author=[[Colin Larkin]] | year=1998 | pages=477 | isbn=0-7535-0236-4}}</ref> By this point the couple had a second son named Ronald and a daughter named Kimberly.<ref name="roots"/> Meanwhile, David supported his family by working at a [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] factory and later by ownership of a [[Texaco]] gas station.<ref name="roots"/> Yoakam's father had acquired a guitar manufactured by the [[Kay Musical Instrument Company]] while in the Army, and gave it to Yoakam after being unable to learn to play it himself. Although Yoakam later broke this guitar, he received another one as a Christmas present while he was in the fourth grade. He also wrote his first song around this point.<ref name="roots"/> As a child, Yoakam took influence from the music that his parents listened to on [[phonograph record|records]] as well as [[WMNI]], then an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] country music radio station in Columbus.<ref name="roots"/> Among these records were compilations by [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Johnny Horton]].<ref name="roots"/> According to his mother, the family would also sing songs to each other when on road trips to visit Yoakam's maternal grandparents. Yoakam himself also stated that he was influenced by [[rock and roll]] acts he had seen on television, such as [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="roots"/>

The Yoakam family moved to another neighborhood of Columbus in 1968, where Yoakam attended [[Northland High School]]. His mother encouraged all three of her children to join the school's band, in which Yoakam played drums. He also attended drama class at Northland High School, which led to him playing the role of Charlie in a production of ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''. Yoakam later attributed this performance as giving him more confidence performing in front of others.<ref name="roots"/> In his senior year of high school, Yoakam and some classmates formed a [[rock and roll]] band to compete in the school's talent show.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="roots"/> The band became popular enough that they began performing at a number of private parties throughout Columbus as The Greaser Band. Yoakam attended [[Ohio State University]], but quickly dropped out in order to focus on his musical career.<ref name="allmusic"/> While playing at a club in [[Gahanna, Ohio]], Yoakam was approached by a man who promised a musical contract but later turned out to be a [[con artist]]. Despite this, Yoakam chose to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to continue pursuing a career in country music. He faced difficulty in the Nashville music scene, as his style was more indebted to [[honky-tonk]] and [[bluegrass music]] at a time when such sounds were not popular compared to [[country pop]] and [[Nashville sound]].<ref name="allmusic"/>

Yoakam then moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], at the encouragement of Billy Alves, a former member of the Greaser Band. While he was initially unsuccessful there as well, he met guitarist and record producer [[Pete Anderson]] at a Los Angeles bar in 1982. The two became friends when they realized they had common interest in musicians such as [[Merle Haggard]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Anderson also observed that [[cowpunk]] and [[alternative country]] were popular in California through acts such as [[Joe Ely]], [[Rank and File (band)|Rank and File]], and [[Lone Justice]]. By performing at clubs where these acts also performed, Yoakam was thus able to gain further exposure.<ref name="roots"/>

==Musical career==
===1984{{ndash}}1986: ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.''===
[[File:PeteAnderson(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Pete Anderson]], seen here in 2009, produced and played lead guitar on the majority of Yoakam's albums.|alt=Musician Pete Anderson playing an electric guitar.]]
By 1984, Yoakam had written a large number of songs. Anderson then encouraged him to record some of them on an [[extended play]]. He also served as producer and lead guitarist on the project, roles he would serve throughout most of Yoakam's career.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> The EP was titled ''[[Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.]]'' and was released through the [[Oak Records]] label. It consisted of five of Yoakam's original compositions, plus a cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]".<ref name="roots"/> Songs from the extended play received airplay on independent radio stations throughout Los Angeles.<ref name="allmusic"/> Later in the year Yoakam was chosen to serve as an opening act for [[The Blasters]]. This led to him being discovered by [[Reprise Records]] executive Paige Levy, who helped Yoakam sign with the label in 1986.<ref name="roots"/> Reprise re-issued ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' that year with four more tracks, thus making it his debut album.<ref name="allmusic"/> One of the added tracks was "Bury Me", a duet with [[Maria McKee]].<ref name="etc review"/> The first single off the album was a cover of [[Johnny Horton]]'s 1956 single "[[Honky-Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]]". Yoakam's rendition of the song charted at number three on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] in mid-1986.<ref name="whitburn"/> The song was even more successful in Canada, reaching the number one position on that nation's country music charts then published by ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/CANADA/RPM/80s/1986/RPM-1986-06-28.pdf | title=RPM country singles | journal=RPM | pages=12 | date=June 28, 1986}}</ref> "Honky Tonk Man" also received a [[music video]], which in 1986 became the first by a country artist to air on [[MTV]].<ref name="gq">{{cite web | url=https://www.gq.com/story/dwight-yoakam-honky-tonk-tales | title=Tall Tales With Dwight Yoakam | publisher=[[GQ]] | date=March 17, 2020 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Alex Pappademas}}</ref> The album itself reached the number one position on ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums.<ref name="Country Albums">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dwight yoakam|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Dwight Yoakam Album & Song Chart History – Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

Two more singles followed, both of which Yoakam wrote himself.

The album was reviewed favorably. Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] wrote of the album that it contained influences of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Bakersfield sound]].

===1987: ''Hillbilly Deluxe''===
Yoakam's second Reprise album ''[[Hillbilly Deluxe (Dwight Yoakam album)|Hillbilly Deluxe]]'' was released in 1987.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album was also led off by a cover song; specifically, [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Little Sister (Elvis Presley song)|Little Sister]]". After this were Yoakam's original compositions "[[Little Ways]]" and "[[Please, Please Baby]]", followed by a cover of [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s "[[Always Late with Your Kisses]]". All four of these cuts made top ten on the country music charts between 1987 and early 1988.<ref name="whitburn"/> "Little Ways" was a number one single on the Canadian ''RPM'' country charts.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/CANADA/RPM/80s/1987/RPM-1987-10-24.pdf | title=RPM Country Singles | journal=RPM | pages=20 | date=October 24, 1987}}</ref> Also covered on the album was [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]]'s "Smoke Along the Track".<ref name="allmusic deluxe"/> One of the other tracks on the album was "Readin', Rightin', Rt. 23", an autobiographical song which Yoakam wrote about the towns along [[U.S. Route 23 in Kentucky]] near his grandparents' houses.<ref name="roots"/> ''Hillbilly Deluxe'' was certified platinum for shipments of one million copies,<ref name="riaa"/> and earned Yoakam another Grammy Award nomination in the category Best Male Country Vocal Performance.<ref name="grammy"/> It also reached number one on Top Country Albums.<ref name="Country Albums"/> Jurek praised the cover songs in his review for AllMusic, where he compared Yoakam's vocal phrasing favorably to [[Merle Haggard]]. He also noted the use of [[lap steel guitar]] and fiddle in Anderson's production, as well as Yoakam's lyrics on "Readin', Rightin', Rt. 23".<ref name="allmusic deluxe">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hillbilly-deluxe-mw0000192537 | title=''Hillbilly Deluxe'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 2, 2022}}</ref> An uncredited review in ''[[Music & Media]]'' magazine stated, "The album features sophisticated, yet fresh country music with rollicking C&W guitar lines, supplemented with Yoakam's straight, yearning vocals."<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1987/M&M-1987-05-16.pdf | title=Albums of the week | journal=[[Music & Media]] | pages=22 | date=May 16, 1987}}</ref>

===1988{{ndash}}1989: ''Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room'' and ''Just Lookin' for a Hit''===
[[File:Buck Owens.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Yoakam had a number one single in 1988 with "[[Streets of Bakersfield]]", a duet with [[Buck Owens]] (pictured here in 1977).|alt=A black-and-white headshot of singer Buck Owens.]]
His third Reprise album was 1988's ''[[Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room]]''. The album was his third and final to top the ''Billboard'' country albums chart.<ref name="Country Albums"/> Its first two singles were also his only number one entries on Hot Country Songs, both peaking there in 1988. These were a cover of [[Buck Owens]]' "[[Streets of Bakersfield]]" which featured Owens on duet vocals, and "[[I Sang Dixie]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> Before "Streets of Bakersfield" was recorded for the album, Yoakam had contacted Owens (who was retired from performing at the time) and convinced him to sing the song on a television special for [[CBS]]. The commercial success of the studio version also led to Owens ending his retirement and re-signing with [[Capitol Records]] later in the decade.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/buck-owens-mn0000941579/biography | title=Buck Owens biography | publisher=AllMusic | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine | access-date=September 2, 2022}}</ref> The third single from ''Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room'' was "[[I Got You (Dwight Yoakam song)|I Got You]]"; while this song reached number five on the country charts, the album's title track failed to enter top 40.<ref name="whitburn"/> This album once again featured Maria McKee on backing vocals, along with accompaniment by [[Tejano music|Tejano]] accordionist [[Flaco Jiménez]]. Also covered on the album were [[Hank Locklin]]'s "[[Send Me the Pillow You Dream On]]" and Johnny Cash's "[[Home of the Blues]]". Jurek thought that the album "shows the first signs of beginning to stretch out and be comfortable with his unique approach to hard honky tonk music, Bakersfield-style".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/buenos-noches-from-a-lonely-room-mw0000200324 | title=''Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 2, 2022}}</ref> ''Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room'' and "Streets of Bakersfield" were respectively nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] at the [[31st Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name="grammy"/> The latter also received a CMA nomination for Vocal Event of the Year.<ref name="cma"/>

Yoakam ended the 1980s with his first [[greatest hits]] album, ''[[Just Lookin' for a Hit]]''. The album consisted of eight previously released singles and two newly recorded cover songs. These were of The Blasters' "Long White Cadillac" and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]' "Sin City", the latter of which Yoakam recorded as a duet with [[k.d. lang]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Dwight Yoakam | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Country Music | publisher=Oxford University Press |editor=Michael McCall |editor2=John Rumble |editor3=Paul Kingsbury | year=2012 | pages=605}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/just-lookin-for-a-hit-mw0000205933 | title=''Just Lookin' for a Hit'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 2, 2022 | author=Thom Jurek}}</ref> "Long White Cadillac" was issued as a single, reaching number 35 on the country music charts.<ref name="whitburn"/><ref name="allmusic"/> The "Sin City" cover received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.<ref name="grammy"/>

[[File:KOSTAS - songwriter (cropped).jpg|150px|thumb|left|Yoakam wrote several songs with [[Kostas (songwriter)|Kostas]] in the 1990s.|alt=Songwriter Kostas in an outdoor setting.]]
In 1990, Yoakam entered the ''Billboard'' country charts for the thirteenth time with "[[Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose]]", which peaked at number eleven.<ref name="whitburn"/> This song led off his fourth studio album ''[[If There Was a Way]]''. The album would account for five more singles between 1990 and 1992: "[[You're the One (Dwight Yoakam song)|You're the One]]", "[[Nothing's Changed Here]]", "[[It Only Hurts When I Cry]]", "[[The Heart That You Own]]", and the [[Patty Loveless]] duet "Send a Message to My Heart". Of these, all except "Send a Message to My Heart" were top-20 country hits.<ref name="whitburn"/> "Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose" was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, Yoakam's fourth nomination in that category.<ref name="grammy"/>

Unlike his previous albums, Yoakam co-wrote several tracks on ''If There Was a Way'' with other writers. He wrote with [[Roger Miller]] on "It Only Hurts When I Cry", a song to which Miller also contributed backing vocals.<ref name="way liner"/> Yoakam had met Miller at the Grammy Awards and presented him with the title, and Miller agreed to co-write the song after Yoakam stated he was a fan of Miller's music.<ref name="right time">{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Gavin-Report/90/93/Gavin-Report-1993-03-05.pdf | title=Dwight Yoakam: The Right Time | author=Cyndi Hoelzle | journal=[[Gavin Report]] | pages=40–41 | date=March 5, 1993}}</ref> "Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose" was one of the first successful cuts for Greek-American songwriter [[Kostas (songwriter)|Kostas]].<ref name="new">{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |date=May 1994 |title=Made in Montana: Kostas Is A Hitmaking Machine From Way Up North |journal=New Country |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=20–21 |issn=1074-536X }}</ref> Record producer [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] had sent Kostas' [[demo (music)|demo]] of the song to Pete Anderson because he thought the song sounded like Yoakam had written it.

Yoakam contributed to two movie soundtracks in 1992. First, he cut two songs for ''[[Falling from Grace (film)|Falling from Grace]]'', the 1992 directorial debut of rock singer [[John Mellencamp]]. Yoakam performed Mellencamp's composition "Common Day Man";<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/falling-from-grace-mw0000277710 | title=''Falling from Grace'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 2, 2022}}</ref> the two also joined [[Joe Ely]], [[John Prine]], and [[James McMurtry]] on the track "Sweet Suzanne".

This rendition charted on Hot Country Songs by year's end.<ref name="whitburn"/> In addition to these, he re-recorded "Miner's Prayer", a track from ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'', as a duet with bluegrass singer [[Ralph Stanley]] on the latter's 1992 album '' Saturday Night & Sunday Morning''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/dwight-yoakam-guide-bluegrass-7518949/ | title=Dwight Yoakam's Guide to Bluegrass, From Ralph Stanley to Ricky Skaggs | publisher=Billboard | date=September 28, 2016 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Elias Leight}}</ref> This track was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.<ref name="grammy"/> Finally, Yoakam released an album titled ''La Croix d'Amour'' for the European market in 1992.

===1993{{ndash}}1996: ''This Time'', ''Dwight Live'', and ''Gone''===
For his next studio album, 1993's ''[[This Time (Dwight Yoakam album)|This Time]]'', Yoakam wrote either by himself or in collaboration with Kostas.

[[File:Dwight Yoakam in 2008.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Yoakam performing in 2008.|alt=Country music singer Dwight Yoakam, looking to his side while strumming a guitar.]]

Yoakam released two albums in 1995. The first was ''[[Dwight Live]]'', a live album recorded in July 1994 in [[San Francisco]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of this album that "nothing on the album improves on the original recorded versions",<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dwight-live-mw0000176531 | title=''Dwight Live'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> while Tony Scherman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' thought the album was "beautifully paced" and showed Yoakam's strengths as a vocalist.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/1995/05/26/dwight-live/ | title=''Dwight Live'' | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=May 26, 1995 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Tony Scherman}}</ref> The album was certified gold in 1996.<ref name="riaa"/> His other release for 1995 was the studio album ''[[Gone (Dwight Yoakam album)|Gone]]''. Yoakam wrote the entire album, collaborating with Kostas on two songs. Among the backing vocalists were [[Carl Jackson]], [[Jim Lauderdale]], [[Joy Lynn White]], and [[The Rembrandts]].<ref name="gone liner">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Gone |others=Dwight Yoakam |date=1995 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Reprise Records |id= 9362-46051-2}}</ref> "[[Nothing (Dwight Yoakam song)|Nothing]]", one of the collaborations with Kostas, was selected as the lead single and charted at number 20 on Hot Country Songs in 1995. The song's [[B-side]] "Gone (That'll Be Me)" and "Sorry You Asked?" were released as singles as well, though neither reached top 40.<ref name="whitburn"/> Jurek thought that individual tracks displayed influences of [[rhythm and blues]], [[mariachi]], [[Tejano music]], and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref name="gone allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/gone-mw0000645809 | title=''Gone'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Thom Jurek}}</ref> Jeffrey B. Remz of [[Country Standard Time]] wrote that ''Gone'' was "a critically received album, which did not do boffo numbers because Yoakam received very little airplay for what was probably his most musically diverse album. And in some parts of the country, his tour did not draw crowds either."<ref name="covers"/>

===1997{{ndash}}1998: ''Under the Covers'', ''Come On Christmas'', ''A Long Way Home''===
Yoakam's next release for Reprise was 1997's ''[[Under the Covers (Dwight Yoakam album)|Under the Covers]]'', an album composed entirely of cover songs.<ref name="allmusic"/> Yoakam and Anderson had begun recording songs for this project prior to ''Gone'', while other selections previously appeared on ''La Croix d'Amour''.<ref name="covers">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/print_article.asp?xid=900 | title=Dwight Yoakam peeks out from 'under the covers' | publisher=Country Standard Time | date=July 1997 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Jeffrey B.

Yoakam wrote the title track and "Santa Can't Stay", while the rest of the album largely consisted of traditional Christmas songs such as "[[Away in a Manger]]" and "[[Silver Bells]]". Thom Owens of AllMusic wrote that the album contained "high-spirited, entertaining country-rockers that may not add anything new to Yoakam's catalog, but they make the record an enjoyable holiday album."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/come-on-christmas-mw0000025120 | title=''Come On Christmas'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Thom Owens}}</ref>

Between 1995 and 1997, Yoakam received three consecutive Grammy nominations in the category of Best Male Country Vocal Performance. The songs nominated in this category were "Pocket of a Clown", "A Thousand Miles from Nowhere", and "Nothing". He also received three consecutive nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] between 1996 and 1998, with the nominations going to ''Dwight Live'', ''Gone'', and ''Under the Covers''.<ref name="grammy"/> After these was his next studio album of original content, 1998's ''[[A Long Way Home (album)|A Long Way Home]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> Yoakam wrote the entire project by himself, making it his first not to have any co-writers or cover songs.{{sfn|McLeese|2012|p=163}} The album charted two singles in "[[Things Change (Dwight Yoakam song)|Things Change]]" and "These Arms".<ref name="whitburn"/> This album also featured Ralph Stanley, this time as a duet partner on "Traveler's Lantern".<ref name="cst"/> Brian Steinberg of Country Standard Time thought that the album was "back to basics" and comparable to Yoakam's releases in the 1980s, stating that "This isn't Yoakam's most innovative work, but it contains enough moments to make it worth attention."<ref name="cst">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2149 | title=''A Long Way Home'' review | publisher=Country Standard Time | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Brian Steinberg}}</ref> Also in 1998, Yoakam funded a charity album for release on Little Dog Records, a label which his then-producer and guitarist Pete Anderson owned.

In 1998, [[Columbia Records]] released ''[[A Tribute to Tradition]]'', a multi-artist tribute album to 1960s and 1970s country music. Yoakam was one of several artists featured on the album's closing track "Same Old Train", an original composition by [[Marty Stuart]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-tribute-to-tradition-mw0000600042 | title=''A Tribute to Tradition'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Jana Pendragon}}</ref> The track featured twelve other country musicians, including [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Clint Black]], and [[Randy Travis]].

Yoakam ended the decade with his second greatest-hits package, ''[[Last Chance for a Thousand Years: Dwight Yoakam's Greatest Hits from the 90's]]''. In addition to tracks from his 1990s Reprise albums, the compilation included three new songs.

===2000{{ndash}}01: ''dwightyoakamacoustic.net'' and ''Tomorrow's Sounds Today''===
Yoakam's tenure with Reprise Records ended with a pair of albums both released in 2000.

The only exception was a re-recording of "Guitars, Cadillacs", which Yoakam performed ''[[a cappella]]''.<ref name="acoustic"/> Yoakam said that he was inspired to do such an album due to the success of similar acoustic renditions in his concerts. He had originally planned to release the album through his website until representatives of Reprise Records thought the album had sales potential. The album itself had minimalistic packaging as well, consisting solely of a sticker with the album's name on the front of an otherwise-clear CD case.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/429082785 | title=Dwight Yoakam returns to basics | work=[[Times Leader|The Times Leader]] | date=July 28, 2000 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Mario Tarradell | pages=13}}</ref> Steve Huey of AllMusic thought that the album's minimalism allowed a greater focus on Yoakam's vocal interpretation than previous albums.<ref name="acoustic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dwightyoakamacousticnet-mw0000064106 | title=''dwightyoakamacoustic.net'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Steve Huey}}</ref>

Between 2003 and 2004, Yoakam released three more compilations of covers albums to fulfill contractual obligations with his labels.{{sfn|McLeese|2012|p=191}} The first was 2003's ''[[In Others' Words]]'' on Reprise.

The oldest track was a cover of the [[Grateful Dead]]'s "[[Truckin']]", which Yoakam cut in 1991.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cmt.com/news/jmw6sl/yoakams-second-album-of-covers-due | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220904035338/https://www.cmt.com/news/jmw6sl/yoakams-second-album-of-covers-due | url-status=dead | archive-date=September 4, 2022 | title=Yoakam's second album of covers due | publisher=CMT | date=July 30, 2003 | access-date=September 3, 2022}}</ref> Jurek wrote that the compilation was "far from a stellar set but does fill in the gaps nicely."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-others-words-mw0000317949 | title=''In Others' Words'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022}}</ref> [[Rhino Records]] released a greatest-hits package titled ''[[The Very Best of Dwight Yoakam]]'' in 2004.

===2005{{ndash}}2007: ''Blame the Vain'' and ''Dwight Sings Buck''===
In 2005, Yoakam signed with [[New West Records]], an [[Americana music]] label based out of California. His first release for the label was 2005's ''[[Blame the Vain]]''. It was also Yoakam's first credit as a producer, as he had ended his relationship with Pete Anderson in 2004. At the time, former [[RCA Records]] artist [[Keith Gattis]] had taken over as Yoakam's guitarist and bandleader.{{sfn|McLeese|2012|p=191-192}} Yoakam said that he had contacted a number of producers until Gattis encouraged him to produce by himself.<ref name="joyful">{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhQEAAAAMBAJ | title=A joyful return for Yoakam | author=Phyllis Stark | magazine=Billboard | pages=39, 40 | date=June 25, 2005}}</ref> New West partnered with [[Columbia Records]] to release two singles to radio.<ref name="joyful"/> These were "Intentional Heartache" and the title track, which both made the lower regions of the country charts in 2005 and accounted for Yoakam's last appearance there.<ref name="whitburn"/> In the book ''Dwight Yoakam: A Thousand Miles from Nowhere'', Don McLeese thought that Anderson's absence gave the album "an unbridled lack of restraint", citing the [[hard rock]] sound and spoken-word coda of "Intentional Heartache" as examples.{{sfn|McLeese|2012|p=192-193}} Ray Waddell of ''Billboard'' also noted a "hard-charging" sound to the album, comparing various tracks to [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBQEAAAAMBAJ | title=Reviews | author=Ray Waddell | magazine=Billboard | pages=42 | date=July 2, 2005}}</ref> Rhino Records re-issued ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc, Etc.'' in 2006 to honor the album's 20th anniversary.

After Buck Owens' death in 2006, Yoakam began performing covers of his songs in concert. This culminated in his 2007 album ''[[Dwight Sings Buck]]'', composed entirely of Owens covers. Yoakam recorded the project with his touring band, which at the time included then-former [[The Mavericks|Mavericks]] member [[Eddie Perez (guitarist)|Eddie Perez]] on lead guitar. Yoakam stated that he and the band listened to Owens' originals to draw inspiration from the recordings. Among the songs chosen were "[[Act Naturally]]", "[[Crying Time]]", and "Close Up the Honky Tonks", the last of which served as the lead single.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow4EAAAAMBAJ | title=Nashville Scene | author=Ken Tucker | magazine=Billboard | pages=65 | date=October 13, 2007}}</ref> A review in AllMusic was favorable, stating that "He doesn't set out to imitate Owens' style or delivery, but he does capture the essence of each song, playing them as Buck intended: no frills, no foolin' around".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dwight-sings-buck-mw0000488962 | title=''Dwight Sings Buck'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Jeff Tamarkin}}</ref>

In 2002, Yoakam had a role in the [[David Fincher]] movie ''[[Panic Room]]''.

==Musical styles and influences==
Yoakam's style is defined by a variety of influences both inside and outside country music. These influences include [[rockabilly]],<ref name=Meredith>{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/dwight-yoakam/catching-up-with-dwight-yoakam/ |title=Catching Up With Dwight Yoakam |last=Meredith |first=Kyle |date=September 4, 2014 |publisher=Paste Magazine |access-date=2022-09-14}}</ref> [[honky-tonk]], [[neotraditional country]], [[Bakersfield sound]], and [[country rock]]. Colin Larkin wrote in ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'' that Yoakam's music showed influences of "the honky-tonk country music of [[Buck Owens]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]]" and "a distinct antipathy toward the [[Nashville sound|Nashville pop]]/country scene."<ref name="virgin"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that "With his stripped-down approach to traditional honky tonk and Bakersfield country, Dwight Yoakam helped return country music to its roots in the late '80s."<ref name="allmusic"/> Erlewine also noted that Yoakam's fanbase typically consisted of people who listened to [[roots rock]] and [[rock and roll]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Thom Jurek of AllMusic thought that Pete Anderson's electric guitar work was also an  important part of his sound, comparing such work to [[Don Rich]] of Buck Owens' backing band [[The Buckaroos]].<ref name="allmusic way">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/if-there-was-a-way-mw0000316840 | title=''If There Was a Way'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Thom Jurek}}</ref> Jurek also thought that the prominent uses of electric guitar and [[Hammond organ]] were examples of Yoakam's rock influences.<ref name="allmusic way"/>

Yoakam describes his own songwriting style as "fragmented". He told Al Caudell of ''[[American Songwriter]]'' that he usually wrote songs by coming up with a melody and then determining the intended mood. From there, he said he would come up with a "thesis" for the song. He also stated that he preferred not to write in a linear fashion, as he thought writing a song in one sitting would cause him to feel creatively burnt out.<ref name="caudell"/> He also said that memories of his childhood were influential in his songwriting style, particularly in the bluegrass music to which he listened; he told ''American Songwriter'' that he enjoyed the "irony that's always been part of bluegrass in that it sets melodic, lilting melodies and upbeat tempos with the most tragic lyrics."<ref name="caudell"/>

Cyndi Hoelzle of ''[[Gavin Report]]'' noted Yoakam's appeal outside traditional country music, stating in 1993 that "[h]is records sold across the board-to middle-aged [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] fans and to young punk rockers who'd seen Dwight do his thing in L.A., opening shows for [[Los Lobos]] and the [[Violent Femmes]]."<ref name="right time"/> Richard Cromelin of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that Yoakam's musical image was that of a "brooding, intensely private figure driven by restless ambition and an edgy intellectuality more commonly found in rock stars."<ref name="times">{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-04-ca-18755-story.html | title=The Solitary Outsider: A country rebel with a shadowy edge, Dwight Yoakam shuns conventional guidelines to preserve the isolation he values, making contact from the stage with his music, and now acting | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 4, 1993 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Richard Cromelin}}</ref> In the same article, Yoakam stated that "I found out early that one of the ways I was able to make contact was through musical expression."<ref name="times"/> Similarly, he told ''Gavin Report'' in 1993 that "My nature is to be absolutely dissectively analytic.

Yoakam's musical image is also defined by his typical outfits when onstage. Colin Larkin of ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'' wrote that "like [[Don Williams]] and others, he retains the traditional [[Stetson]] hat."<ref name="virgin"/> Alanna Nash wrote in a review of ''If There Was a Way'' that "When Dwight Yoakam first came on the scene, with his hip retro-attitude, concha-studded jeans, and music that often grazed the edge of rock & roll, it was hard to tell whether the California cowboy was for real. The verdict was clear by his third album, ''Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room'', whose key cycle of songs is a classic murder tale that echoes the pride, heartbreak, betrayal, and vengeance of the age-old hillbilly experience."<ref name="nash way"/> Al Caudell of ''American Songwriter'' noted that Yoakam frequently wore "ripped jeans".<ref name="caudell"/> Darryl Smyers of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' wrote that "With his absurdly large hat and [[Flying Burrito Brothers]] fashion sense, Yoakam was championed by a surprising mix of punks, rockabilly hounds, and hard-core honky-tonkers."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/hokum-or-yoakam-6379073 | title=Hokum or Yoakam? | publisher=[[Dallas Observer]] | date=April 13, 2006 | access-date=September 3, 2022}}</ref>

Leonard Running of the ''Rapid City Journal'' referred to Yoakam's singing style as a "plaintive, [[yodel]]-edged voice".<ref name="running"/> An uncredited review of ''Gone'' in ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' stated, "His voice is pure and sweet, but a precise tool.

D. Considine of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' wrote of Yoakam's singing voice that it was a "high, lonesome [[twang]]" and a "sweetly nasal tenor".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1998-06-11-1998162160-story.html | title=Yoakam has the voice and the band | publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] | work=June 11, 1998 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=J.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Yoakam began dating actress [[Sharon Stone]].<ref name="virgin"/><ref name="max"/> He appeared alongside her at that year's [[Academy Awards]] ceremony.<ref name="virgin"/><ref name="gq"/> This encounter led to both of them receiving media attention from tabloids, along with rumors from fans that songs on ''This Time'' were about Stone.

===Legal issues===
Longtime producer and guitarist Pete Anderson filed a lawsuit against him in 2004, stating that he had breached an oral contract by failing to perform a number of concert dates in mid-2002. The lawsuit claimed that by failing to perform these concerts, Yoakam had cost Anderson over $44,000 in salary.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/music-director-sues-dwight-yoakam-1429324/ | title=Music Director Sues Dwight Yoakam | publisher=Billboard | date=September 6, 2004 | access-date=September 3, 2022}}</ref> Yoakam and Anderson settled the lawsuit out of court, with the former stating that some of the financial issues stemming from these concerts were due to money lost in the commercial failure of ''South of Heaven, West of Hell''. This financial dispute also ended the two's musical partnership, with Anderson saying that Yoakam "didn't want [him] around anymore".{{sfn|McLeese|2012|p=166, 182, 183}} Anderson told ''[[Style Weekly]]'' in 2011 that he still respected Yoakam's artistry but had no intention of working with him again.<ref name="blues"/>

Yoakam filed a lawsuit against Warner Music in 2021 when the label withdrew several of his songs from streaming services due to expiration of contract.

'''Tanner Elle Schneider''' (born July 3, 1989), known professionally by her stage name '''Elle King''', is an American singer, musician, songwriter, and actress. Her musical style is influenced by [[Country music|country]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[blues]].<ref name=Empire/> 

In 2012, King released her debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[The Elle King EP]]'', on [[RCA Records|RCA]]; one track from that EP, "Playing for Keeps", is the theme song for VH1's ''[[Mob Wives Chicago]]'' series.<ref name="vanityfair"/> 

She released her debut album, ''[[Love Stuff]]'', in 2015. It produced the US top ten single "[[Ex's & Oh's]]", which earned her two [[Grammy Award]] nominations. King has also toured with acts such as [[Of Monsters and Men]], [[Train (band)|Train]], [[James Bay (singer)|James Bay]], [[The Chicks]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Joan Jett]], [[Michael Kiwanuka]], and [[Miranda Lambert]]. Her parents are actor and comedian [[Rob Schneider]] and former model London King.  She uses her mother's surname to distinguish herself and her career and identity from her father's, telling [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] that "I think that my voice and my music speaks for itself: that I am my own person."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/singer-elle-king-rob-schneiders-daughter-dropped-dads/story?id=34911637|website=ABC News|title=Why Singer Elle King, Rob Schneider's Daughter, Dropped Her Dad's Name|first=Andrea|last=Dresdale|date=November 2, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2022}}</ref>

King is a four-time [[Grammy Award]] nominee, two each in the rock and country categories, and received honors from the [[Country Music Association Awards]] and the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]].

==Early life==
King was born Tanner Elle Schneider on July 3, 1989, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to American comedian and actor [[Rob Schneider]] and American model London King.<ref name="birthday">{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/elle-king-posts-hopeful-message-28th-birthday/story?id=48425088 |title=Elle King posts hopeful message on her 28th birthday |last=Tuccillo |first=Andrea |work=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |date=July 3, 2017 |access-date=July 15, 2018}}</ref><ref name=AXS>{{cite web |url=https://www.axs.com/the-top-10-best-elle-king-songs-90679 |title=The top 10 best Elle King songs |last=Wallace |first=Jeff |work=AXS |date=July 10, 2016 |access-date=July 15, 2018}}</ref><ref name="glamour1">{{cite web |last=Weinberg |first=Jen |url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2012/07/elle-king-the-voice-behind-the.html |title=Elle King, the Voice Behind the Mob Wives Theme Song "Playing For Keeps" Talks to Us About True Blood, Pickle Backs, and Showgirls: Obsessed: Entertainment |website=Glamour.com |date=August 5, 2012 |access-date=September 7, 2012}}</ref> Her parents divorced when she was an infant and she and London moved to [[Ohio]]. She was raised in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Wellston, Ohio|Wellston]]. Her mother remarried Justin Tesa in 2000. When she was nine, her stepfather, Justin Tesa,<ref name=imdbbio>{{cite web |title=Elle King – Biography |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0773792/bio |website=IMDb.com |access-date=February 22, 2015}}</ref> gave her a record by [[all-female band|all-female hard-rock band]] [[the Donnas]]; she views this as the pivotal moment when she decided she wanted to be a musician. Around this time, she also started listening to [[the Runaways]] and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and she made her acting debut alongside her father in the movie ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]''.<ref name="vanityfair"/>

At the age of 13, King started playing guitar, immersing herself in the music of [[Otis Redding]], the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], [[Etta James]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Al Green]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[AC/DC]] (she has the phrase "dirty deeds" tattooed on her biceps), and [[Earl Scruggs]].<ref name="vanityfair"/> Her interest in the [[Country music|country]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] of Hank Williams and Earl Scruggs inspired her to learn the banjo. During her teenage years, she attended [[Buck's Rock]] camp in Connecticut, where she starred successfully in a number of musicals.<ref name="glamour1"/>

King spent her teenage years in [[New York City]], but she has also lived in Los Angeles, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Upon graduating from [[Little Red School House|Elisabeth Irwin High School/Little Red School House]],<ref name=klaw>{{cite web |title='Catch of the Day' - Dierks Bentley ft Elle King |url=http://klaw.com/catch-of-the-day-dierks-bentley-ft-elle-king-different-for-girls-audio/ |website=KLAW 101 - Oklahoma's Best Country |date=June 6, 2016 |access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> she moved to Philadelphia to enroll at the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]], studying painting and film.<ref name=klaw /> During these college years, she had an artistic epiphany seeing a live show where the band onstage used a [[banjo]] purely for accompaniment purposes, eschewing the bluegrass and country musical vocabulary traditionally associated with the instrument. King then began to use the banjo as a compositional tool. After college, she briefly lived in Copenhagen and Los Angeles, before moving back to New York where she currently resides in [[Bushwick, Brooklyn]].<ref name="vanityfair"/>

==Career==

'''Emily Burns Strayer''' ({{née}} '''Erwin''', previously '''Robison'''; born August 16, 1972) is an American songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist, and a founding member of the [[Country music|country]] band [[the Chicks]], formerly known as the Dixie Chicks. Strayer plays [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, lap steel, [[Upright bass|bass]], [[mandolin]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]], [[piano]], and [[sitar]]. Initially in her career with the Chicks, she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals, but within her role in the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], she took on the role of lead vocalist.

==Early life==

Emily Erwin was born in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the suburban town of [[Addison, Texas]], on the northern edge of [[Dallas]], where she was raised with her two older sisters, Julia and [[Martie Maguire|Martha]]. Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha (later nicknamed Martie) shared, and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school.

Emily began playing the violin at age seven, and the [[banjo]] at age ten, afterward learning all the [[string instruments]] she could find.<ref name="Malkin">Malkin, Nina [http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html "A Little About Martie"], Dixie Chicks Henhouse (Retrieved December 31, 2007).</ref> Years later, Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle, and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument, she forced Emily to learn something else.<ref>{{cite video | title=[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]] |date=2006 | medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[The Weinstein Company]]}}</ref> Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo, by reading books to teach herself the [[chord progressions]].<ref name="Malkin"/>

From 1984–1989, Jane Frost (Director of the [[Patsy Montana|Patsy Montana Museum]] and the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]]) remembers watching the sisters mature, teaming up with schoolmates Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]. The foursome were touring in a teenage [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group they named the Blue Night Express, in part because of the amount of traveling they had to do to reach far away festivals, frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night. They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others. The sisters were said to have an "almost obsessive" interest in [[busking]] at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals.<ref name=Frost>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Jane|title=Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS, Early 1980s|url=http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|website=The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page|date=July 15, 1999|access-date=December 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002233114/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|archive-date=October 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Faraway Hills">[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html "Sharon Gilchrist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182257/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, Faraway Hills (Retrieved February 12, 2008).</ref> After Martie graduated from secondary school at [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)|Greenhill School]] with Emily still completing her studies, both remained active in the bluegrass scene.

==The Chicks==
[[File:Emily Robison with the Dixie Chicks 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|left|With the Dixie Chicks; 1998]]

In 1989, after years of attending [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[festivals]] and [[busking]] where they could, Emily joined her sister Martie, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and [[upright bass]] player [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]]. Frost, again, recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together. Martie felt they could do well. Robin said, ".. It's going to be a 'hot' band," to which Emily responded, "I give it six months, and if we aren't making money by then, I'm out of here!".<ref name="Frost" /> Strayer was shy, and the youngest member of the group. She had enjoyed playing throughout school, but was at an age where she was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the [[United States Air Force Academy]].<ref name="Clark">Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml "Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191833/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml |date=March 4, 2016 }} ''Dallas Life Magazine'' in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', March 1, 1992 (Retrieved January 23, 2008).</ref>

By 1993, the band had evolved into a new direction. Macy left the group for a "purer" [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] sound. Lynch, thrust into the position of sole lead singer, was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer [[Natalie Maines]] after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest.<ref name="Dickerson">Dickerson, James L. (2000) ''Dixie Chicks: Down-Home and Backstage''. Taylor Trade Publishing, Dallas, Texas. {{ISBN|0-87833-189-1}}.</ref> Strayer commented, "We were prepared to pay our dues for as long as it took; we were prepared for longevity. We know that we will always be playing music together, so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

But in later interviews, the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time: the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent.  In an article in the April/May edition of ''Country Music Magazine'', Emily stated, "We felt we needed the next calibre of singer."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[File:Emily-Robison.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Strayer in concert with the [[Dixie Chicks]], Austin, Texas, 2006]]

From there, massive commercial success ensued, with their 1998 and 1999 albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' and  ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' both achieving [[diamond record]] status. Strayer was a key element of the group's look, with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first, and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color, and distinguishing herself visually from the other two. Strayer and Maguire's instrumental virtuosity set the Dixie Chicks apart from many other country acts, male and female. Strayer's songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks' recording career. <!-- needs expansion, reference to particular songs -->

Strayer stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines' remarks about U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] hit the newswire on the eve before the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. She was the only bandmate to realize that - while in the U.K., there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience - back in the United States, Maines' criticism of President Bush would not be well received. Nevertheless, even when her home was trashed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks' successful careers in music, she remained loyal to Maines, as did her sister.

==Court Yard Hounds==
[[File:Emily-Robison 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Strayer with the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]] at Antone's, [[SXSW]], March 18, 2010]]
Strayer spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school, first with her older sister, and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks. After the bandmates celebrated their five [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them, but Strayer was eager to return to writing and touring. When Strayer's marriage came to an end, she began expressing herself by songwriting. Some of her compositions include her feelings about the breakup with her former husband, and expected that soon, the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing, but Natalie Maines was reluctant to do so. After four years, Strayer became "angry and frustrated", and in sending her new songs to her sister, conveyed her increasing disappointment.<ref name="All Things Considered">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126554419|title=Dixie Chicks Musicians Strike Out on Their Own|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=May 6, 2010|work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=October 3, 2010}}</ref> With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily and sister Martie have formed a side project called the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], with Strayer as lead vocalist.

== History ==
Howe Gelb, also a prolific solo artist, started the group as Giant Sandworms in the late 1970s in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. In 1980, an EP was released entitled ''Will Wallow and Roam After the Ruin.'' After which Gelb sacked the other members.<ref name="LarkinGE" /> 1983 saw the release of ''Valley of Rain'' on [[Enigma Records]] with the shortened name of Giant Sand. It had Scott Garber on bass, Winston Watson on drums for most tracks, with Tommy Larkins drumming on the others.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Perlich |first=Tim |date=2018-08-09 |title=Giant Sand Returns To Valley Of Rain |url=https://theperlichpost.blogspot.com/2018/08/giant-sand-returns-to-valley-of-rain.html |access-date=2023-08-12 |website=The Perlich Post}}</ref> By 1990, John Convertino had become the band's drummer. Multi-instrumentalist Joey Burns joined around that time. Convertino and Burns formed [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]] in 1996, later leaving the group to concentrate on that project. In 2004, saw the first release without Convertino and Burns; the ''Is All Over the Map'' album.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Giant Sand: Is All Over the Map |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3445-is-all-over-the-map/ |access-date=2023-08-12 |website=Pitchfork |language=en-US}}</ref>

'''Gina Villalobos''' is an American singer-songwriter and composer. From 1992 thorough 2013, she extensively toured and recorded in the United States, the UK and Europe, writing songs and making music in bands and as a solo artist. Counting her most recent release, ''Sola'' (2014), Villalobos has released five solo studio albums. She continues to sing and compose in her work as a music creator at ''Feverpitch'', where she services the motion picture industry, specifically those companies making movie [[trailer music]]. She creates sound effects, produces music, and composes original scores.

== Early life ==
Villalobos spent her childhood in the [[Santa Monica]] Mountain community of Lake Sherwood, California. By way of inspiration, Gina's mother handed down her passion for music, while her father [[Reynaldo Villalobos]] is an acclaimed [[cinematographer]] and director.<ref name="dostuff" /> By the time she was seven, Villalobos was teaching herself guitar, and began her music career at the end of college.

== Musical career ==
In her early 20s, Villalobos fronted and played guitar in the acoustic folk trio Liquid Sunshine. Together, they recorded the albums ''Sweet Commitment'' and ''Barbary Lane'', as well as the self-titled ''Liquid Sunshine EP'' before disbanding in 1996. Between 1997 and 2001, Villalobos fronted the band The Mades, with whom she recorded two albums, before starting her solo career with 2002's ''Beg From Me''.<ref name="dostuff" />

In 2004, she caught the attention of respected U.S. publications like ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'', ''[[Acoustic Guitar (magazine)|Acoustic Guitar]]'', and ''[[Harp (magazine)|Harp]]''.<ref>[http://ginavillalobos.bandzoogle.com/press/  Press quotes collection].</ref> In anticipation of her sophomore studio album, ''Live from [[KXLU]] Radio'' was released, containing a live recording with songs off the new album. With her second outing, ''Rock 'N' Roll Pony'', the European press and radio praised the CD, which reached No. 3 on the Euro-Americana charts, and by 2005, Villalobos was performing in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. She toured with [[Laura Veirs]]<ref>[http://lauraveirs.com/  Laura Veirs main page]</ref> in 2005 on her UK tour.  Her 2007 self-release ''Miles Away'' repeated her previous successes in the U.K. press and on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Around that time, the alternative rock band [[World Party]]<ref>[http://www.worldparty.net/  World Party Main Page]</ref> invited Villalobos to tour the States with them, and her songs started showing up in movies and TV shows like ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and ''[[Army Wives]]''. Two years later, Gina delivered ''Days on Their Side''.

Villalobos has been associated with [[Anne McCue]],<ref>[http://www.annemccue.com/ Anne McCue Main Page]</ref> and has been recognized for her contribution to California songs.

In 2014, after an extended hiatus and having taken the time to produce the album since January 2012,<ref name="dostuff" /> ''Sola'' was released. She produced and Erik Colvin engineered, as he's done for each of her previous three offerings. Augmenting Gina's vocals and guitar are guitarist Kevin Haaland ([[Andy Grammer]]), back for his fourth Gina Villalobos album, and returning guitarist Josh Grange ([[Sheryl Crow]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Beck]], [[Dixie Chicks]]); Also credited are Eric Heywood ([[Son Volt]], [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[The Pretenders]], [[Alejandro Escovedo]]) on pedal steel. Upright bass was performed by Ian Walker (k.d. lang, [[Cher]], [[Paula Cole]], [[The Ditty Bops]]). Quinn ([[Tracy Chapman]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Paula Cole]]) was the drummer.

In late 2015, The [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[Amazon Studios]] TV show, ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502262/ Transparent IMDB link]</ref> selected the arrangement featuring the 
Gina Villalobos/Eric Colvin produced version<ref>[https://ginavillalobos.bandcamp.com/track/family-affair-derivative-work Family Affair stream on Bandcamp]</ref> of the 1971 [[Sly and the Family Stone]] hit "[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]" featuring the vocals of [[Ruby Friedman]] for use in the trailer promoting the launch of Season 2.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CluxHR9pkdQ Official Amazon Studio Transparent Season 2 Trailer]</ref>

'''James Gregory Keelor''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|size=100%|OC}} (born '''Francis McIntyre'''; August 29, 1954) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. He is best known as a member of the band [[Blue Rodeo]], where he shares song writing and vocal duties with [[Jim Cuddy]]. Keelor has also released three solo albums and appeared as a guest musician on albums by [[Crash Vegas]] and [[Melissa McClelland]]. He participated, along with [[Rick White (musician)|Rick White]] and members of [[The Sadies]], in the supergroup [[The Unintended]].

==Early life==
Keelor was born Francis McIntyre in [[Inverness, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], Nova Scotia, on August 29, 1954.<ref name="maple">{{cite web|url=http://maplemusic.com/artists/gke/bio.asp|title=Bio – Greg Keelor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020225055927/http://maplemusic.com/artists/gke/bio.asp|access-date=August 30, 2018|archive-date=February 25, 2002}}</ref> Though he didn't know until adulthood, his birth parents had put him up for adoption. Keelor was adopted at age three and raised in [[Montréal]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/greg-keelor/|title=Greg Keelor|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>

Keelor attended [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]], and it was there that he befriended football teammate [[Jim Cuddy]] in 1971. After graduation, Keelor, Cuddy and a group of college friends, in search of adventure, traveled to Western Canada in a rundown old school bus. The bus broke down in [[Saskatchewan]], and Keelor somehow or another ended up in [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]] where he worked for a time. It was in Lake Louise that he learned to play the guitar and first considered a career as a musician.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

== Career ==
Keelor has been friends with [[Jim Cuddy]] since both attended [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]] high school. When they both had finished university, they decided to form a band which they called the Hi-Fi's, along with Jim Sublett on drums and Malcolm Schell playing bass. The band released a single in 1980 featuring "I Don't Know Why (You Love Me)" and on the B side "Look What You've Done". The record was not a big commercial success, though, and when they couldn't get a record deal in Toronto, they headed off to New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canuckistanmusic.com/index.php?maid=308|title=Review of Hi-Fi's I Don't Know Why (You Love Me)|website=canuckistanmusic.com|publisher=Canuckistan Music|last1=Panontin|first1=Michael|access-date=February 14, 2015}}</ref> A while after returning to Toronto from New York, Keelor and Cuddy formed Blue Rodeo.

Keelor is also a producer, having co-produced Blue Rodeo's ''[[Lost Together (Blue Rodeo album)|Lost Together]]'' and solo-producing [[Cuff the Duke]]'s albums ''[[Way Down Here]]'' and ''[[Morning Comes (album)|Morning Comes]]''.

Keelor also composed an original soundtrack for the 2010 Canadian Western comedy ''[[Gunless]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/blue_rodeo-better_off_as_we_are| title=Blue Rodeo- Better Off As We Are| work=Exclaim Magazine| access-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2000, Keelor and Blue Rodeo bandmate Jim Cuddy were the recipients of the National Achievement Award at the annual [[SOCAN]] Awards held in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2000-socan-awards |title=2000 Socan Awards &#124; Socan |access-date=August 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916155756/https://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2000-socan-awards |archive-date=September 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2013, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] along with [[Jim Cuddy]], "for their contributions to Canadian music and for their support of various charitable causes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15482&lan=eng|title=Governor General Announces 90 New Appointments to the Order of Canada|date=December 30, 2013}}</ref>

'''Harmony James'''  is an Australian singer-songwriter. Although James is often classified as a country artist, her music draws on many genres, including [[folk music|folk]], pop, rock and [[blues music|blues]]. In 2006 Harmony first came to the attention of the music industry when she became the only Australian songwriter to have won the country category of the International Songwriting Competition, with her song "Tailwind".<ref name="update" /> Her second single, "Somebody Stole My Horse",  became Australian radio's second most played country song in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Herm Kovac Productions|url=http://www.ramrodstudio.com/Herm%20kovac.html|work=Ramrod Studio|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> spawned 

==Early life==
Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia to a [[Baptist]] preacher as one of twelve children, Harmony went to a private school and says she had "few friends".<ref name="courier" /> She read voraciously, eventually discovering the western novels of [[Louis L'Amour]].<ref name=update>{{cite journal|title=Tailwind or Tornado?|journal=Country Update|issue=54|url=http://www.countryupdate.com.au/images/stories/cu54/01_harmony_james.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> James discovered traditional country music after a friend returned from [[Texas]] with records by [[Dolly Parton]] and [[The Judds]].<ref name="courier" /> Soon after, James taught herself enough guitar to learn a few country songs and took to the streets singing to earn money.

She later ran a stock camp in the outback of [[Queensland]] and worked with cattle on the [[Northern Territory]]'s [[Barkly Tableland]]. She left home to work as a [[Jillaroo (trainee)|jillaroo]] at some of the most remote cattle stations in southwestern Queensland,<ref name="update" /> "covered in mud and blood, roughing it with the guys, working so hard I had biceps and thinking, 'This is not what my mother pictured for me'." A gig at a school fete in [[Goondiwindi]] led to an offer from the local publican and Harmony's songbook started filling, even as she continued her parallel life on the land, from the Cape to [[Tennant Creek]], studying agriculture at [[The University of Queensland]] at [[Gatton, Queensland|Gatton]]<ref name="courier" /> and working as a welder "in a shed of 80 blokes."<ref name=capital>{{cite news|last=Jarvis|first=Susan|title=Complete Harmony|url=http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=1614&issue=117|access-date=1 December 2012|newspaper=Capital News|date=July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427073019/http://www.capitalnews.com.au/editorial.asp?editorial_id=1614&issue=117|archive-date=27 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> "My musical exposure was mostly church music until I got a job as a checkout chick and heard the radio," she says. "Now when I hang out with other musos they'll drop names and I'll just look at them blankly 'cause my music history starts in '95."<ref name=alberts>{{cite web|title=Harmony James|url=http://albertmusic.com/musicians/harmony-james|work=Alberts|publisher=Alberts Pty Ltd.|accessdate=1 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905235752/http://albertmusic.com/musicians/harmony-james|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In late 2018, James' official Facebook page announced a new independent album ''Resignation''. It was produced by Glen Hannah, music critic Bernard Zuel published a favourable review of the record, suggesting "James might be earning the right to be counted among the likes of the more experienced Gretchen Peters and Rosanne Cash".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zuel |first=Bernard |date=2019-01-30 |title=Harmony James - Resignation: Review |url=https://www.bernardzuel.net/post/2019/01/31/harmony-james-resignation-review |access-date=2022-02-26 |website=Bernard Zuel |language=en}}</ref> The ''Sunburnt Country Music'' blog said "despite its title, ''Resignation'' is not an album that sounds like defeat, retreat or weariness – it is a glorious manifestation of James's skills and talent, and it has been worth waiting for".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-02-18 |title=Album review: Resignation by Harmony James |url=https://sunburntcountrymusic.com/2019/02/18/album-review-resignation-by-harmony-james/ |access-date=2022-02-26 |website=Sunburnt Country Music |language=en}}</ref>

DeMent's musical style includes elements of [[Folk music|folk]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She has been nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] twice.

Her family moved from Arkansas to the Los Angeles area when she was three. While growing up, she was exposed to and influenced by country and [[gospel music]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/08/iris_dement.php | title=Iris DeMent: Ass-Kicking, Outlaw Country Singer Talks Growing Up in OC | author=Ziegler, Chris | newspaper=OC Weekly | date=August 9, 2012 | access-date=August 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714204653/http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/08/iris_dement.php | archive-date=July 14, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Singing at age five as one of "the little DeMent sisters", Iris had a bad experience when she forgot her words during her first performance, which caused her to avoid performing in public for some time.<ref name=FreshAir />

DeMent left high school in the tenth grade to work full time at a Kmart store. Her parents required her to get a GED high school diploma. She later went with a boyfriend to Topeka, Kansas, where she attended [[Washburn University]].There she started writing after receiving positive feedback from her English composition professor.<REF>Clancy, Sean. [https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/may/21/iris-dement/ "HIGH PROFILE: Iris DeMent"], ''Arkansas Democrat Gazette'' newspaper, May 21, 2023.</REF>

==Music and career==
DeMent was inspired to write her first song, "Our Town,"  at age 25 by a drive through a boarded-up Midwest town.<ref name=FreshAir /> The song lyrics came to her "exactly as it is now," with no need for re-writing, and she realized then that songwriting was her calling.<ref name=FreshAir /> "Our Town" was played during the closing scene for the final episode (July 26, 1995) of [[CBS]]'s television series ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. The song has been recorded by [[Kate Rusby]], Kate Brislin & [[Jody Stecher]] and [[Trampled by Turtles]].

Her first album, ''[[Infamous Angel]]'', was released in 1992 on the Rounder-Philo label and explored such themes as religious skepticism, small-town life, and human frailty. "Let the Mystery Be" has been covered by a number of artists, including [[10,000 Maniacs]] (whose 'Unplugged' version featured Talking Heads' David Byrne), as well as [[Alice Stuart]]. It was also used in the opening scenes of the film ''[[Little Buddha]]''. In the fall of 2015, a version of "Let the Mystery Be" from the [[Transatlantic Sessions]] became the musical theme for the opening credits of the [[HBO]] series [[The Leftovers (TV series)|''The Leftovers'']], replacing the original "Main Title Theme" composed by [[Max Richter]], and it would once again serve as the opening theme for the series finale.

In her second album, ''My Life'', released in 1994, she continued the personal and introspective approach. The record is dedicated to her father, who died two years earlier. ''My Life'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best Contemporary Folk Album category.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The 37th Grammy Nominations |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-06-ca-17089-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles |date=January 6, 1995 |access-date=February 24, 2015 }}

DeMent's third album, ''[[The Way I Should]]'', was released in 1996. Featuring the [[protest song]] "Wasteland of the Free", it is DeMent's most political work. It covers topics such as sexual abuse, religion, government policy, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.nodepression.com/1996/11/homespun-of-the-brave|title=Homespun of the Brave|author=Cantwell, David|publisher=No Depression|date=Nov–Dec 1996|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605182840/http://archives.nodepression.com/1996/11/homespun-of-the-brave/|archive-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

DeMent sang the duet "Bell Bottomed Tear" as part of [[The Beautiful South]]'s Much ''[[Later... with Jools Holland|Later with Jools]]'' live special in 1997. <ref>{{Citation |title=The Beautiful South feat Iris DeMent - Bell Bottomed Tear - Later With Jools Holland BBC2 1997 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTiUtfeqT9Y |access-date=2023-10-31 |language=en}}</ref>

In 1998, the song "[[Iris (song)|Iris]]" by the rock band [[Goo Goo Dolls]] was named after her. Singer and songwriter [[John Rzeznik]] had already written the lyrics to the song but was having a problem naming it. He opened up the [[LA Weekly]] and noticed that DeMent was playing in town and thought her name was beautiful and then decided to name it after her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-the-song-iris-by-goo-goo-dolls|title=The Story Behind The Song: Iris by Goo Goo Dolls|first=Henry Yates 2019-01-31T13:15:00Z Classic|last=Rock|website=Classic Rock Magazine|date=January 31, 2019 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

'''James McMurtry''' (born March 18, 1962, in [[Fort Worth, Texas]])<ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4878}}</ref> is an American rock and folk rock/[[Americana (music)|americana]] singer, songwriter, guitarist, bandleader, and occasional actor (''[[Daisy Miller (film)|Daisy Miller]]'', ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'', and narrator of ''Ghost Town: 24 Hours in Terlingua''). He performs with veteran bandmates Daren Hess, Cornbread and Tim Holt.

His father, novelist [[Larry McMurtry]], gave him his first guitar at age seven. His mother, an English professor, taught him how to play it: "My mother taught me three chords and the rest I just stole as I went along. I learned everything by ear or by watching people."

==Biography==
McMurtry spent his first seven years in Ft. Worth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/2008/04/17/one-on-one-with-james-mcmurtry/ |title=One on One with James McMurtry |publisher=HoboTrashcan |date=2008-04-17 |access-date=2012-11-21}}</ref> but was raised mostly in [[Leesburg, Virginia]]. He attended the [[Woodberry Forest School]], [[Orange, Virginia]]. He began performing in his teens, writing bits and pieces.  He started performing his own songs at a downtown [[beer garden]] while studying English and Spanish at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. After traveling to [[Alaska]] and playing a few gigs, he returned to [[Texas]] and his father's  "little bitty ranch house crammed with 10,000 books". After a time, he left for [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], where he worked as a house painter, actor, bartender, and sometimes singer, performing at writers' nights and open-mic events.

In 1987, a friend in San Antonio suggested McMurtry enter the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk songwriter contest; he became one of six winners that year. Also around this time [[John Mellencamp]] was starring in a film based on a script by McMurtry's father, which gave McMurtry the opportunity to send a demo tape to Mellencamp. Mellencamp subsequently served as co-producer on McMurtry's debut album, ''[[Too Long in the Wasteland]]'' (1989). McMurtry also appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Falling from Grace (film)|Falling from Grace]]'', working with Mellencamp, [[John Prine]], [[Joe Ely]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]] in a "supergroup" called Buzzin' Cousins.

McMurtry released follow-up albums ''[[Candyland (James McMurtry album)|Candyland]]'' (1992) and ''Where'd You Hide the Body'' (1995). 1997 saw the release of "It Had to Happen" which included a cover of "[[Wild Man from Borneo (song)|Wild Man from Borneo]]" originally done by Kinky Friedman and "[[Sixty Acres]]"; a rollicking tune about a dead grandma and the events afterwards.

''Walk Between the Raindrops'' followed in 1998 and 2002 brought ''St. Mary of the Woods''. In April 2004, McMurtry released a tour album called ''Live in Aught-Three''. "[[Choctaw Bingo]]", one of McMurtry's most popular songs, is featured on both ''St. Mary of the Woods'' and ''Live in Aught-Three''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_spectator/2009/03/choctaw_bingo.html|author=Rosenbaum, Ron|title=Choctaw Bingo : A modest proposal for a new national anthem|journal=SLATE|date=13 March 2009|access-date=13 March 2009}}</ref>

In 2005, McMurtry released his first studio album in three years. ''[[Childish Things]]'' again received high critical praise, winning the song and album of the year at the 5th Annual [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Music Awards]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The album was perhaps McMurtry at his most political, as his working-class anthem "We Can't Make It Here" included direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]], the [[Iraq War]], and [[Wal-Mart]]. The music critic [[Robert Christgau]] ranked "We Can't Make It Here" as the best song of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |title=Rolling Stone Ballot: The 00's Best Songs & Albums |publisher=Robert Christgau |access-date=2012-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102174101/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |archive-date=2010-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

McMurtry released his follow-up album to ''[[Childish Things]]'' in April 2008. ''[[Just Us Kids]]'' continued with the previous album's political themes and included the song "Cheney's Toy," McMurtry's most direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]] so far. Like "We Can't Make It Here" from the previous album, "Cheney's Toy" was made available as a free Internet download.

McMurtry's ninth album, ''[[Complicated Game (album)|Complicated Game]]'' was released on February 24, 2015 on an L.A. record label also named Complicated Game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/11/04/james-mcmurtry-returns-with-howm-i-gonna-find-you-now-from-new-lp-exclusive/ |title=James McMurtry Returns With 'How'm I Gonna Find You Now' From New LP (Exclusive)|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=4 November 2014|publisher=The Wall St Journal |access-date=2014-11-07|last1=Danton|first1=Eric R.}}</ref> The album achieved critical acclaim, scoring 87 on Metacritic. Lead single "How’m I Gonna Find You Now" and other tracks such as album opener "Copper Canteen" have become staples in the McMurtry canon.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry tour statistics|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/james-mcmurtry-3bd798bc.html|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref>

''Cold and Bitter Tears: The Songs of Ted Hawkins'', released in late 2015 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, includes McMurtry's take on the late busker's song "Big Things". Additionally, ''Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay'', released in early 2016 (also on Eight 30 Records), features McMurtry's version of Finlay's "Comfort's Just a Rifle Shot Away."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dreamer-a-tribute-to-kent-finlay-mw0002916063 |title=Various Artists: Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay |work=AllMusic }}</ref>

McMurtry contributed his rendition of Adam Carroll's "Screen Door" to ''Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll'' (Eight 30 Records, 2016) as well as "Grandpa's Promise" to the satirical album ''Floater: A Tribute to the Tributes to Gary Floater'' (Eight 30 Records, 2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eight30records.com/|title=Eight 30 Records|website=Eight 30 Records|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref> Also in 2018 McMurtry performed at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.<ref>[https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ "41st Vancouver Folk Music Festival still true to tradition, still young at heart"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713225922/https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ |date=2019-07-13 }}. July 14, 2018 , ''Vancouver Weekly'', Paul Hecht and Elmira Kuznetsova</ref>

During restrictions on touring and live music imposed by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]], McMurtry started streaming several live acoustic performances a week on Facebook and YouTube. After using this platform to premiere new songs including "If It Don't Bleed", a new album, ''The Horses and the Hounds'', was announced on June 9, 2021 and released on August 20. Lead track "Canola Fields" was released to streaming services at the time of the announcement and would go on to get an Americana Music Award nomination. The album, produced by longtime collaborator Russ Hogarth and recorded at Jackson Browne's Santa Monica [[Groove Masters]] studio, was reviewed positively, scoring an 81 on Metacritic.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=James McMurtry Is Hung Up on the Details|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/james-mcmurtry-horses-and-the-hounds-album-1214772/|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Horses and the Hounds by James McMurtry|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/the-horses-and-the-hounds/james-mcmurtry|website=Metacritic}}</ref> Pitchfork reviewer [[Stephen Deusner]] said of the record: "McMurtry sounds more engaged here, more focused, and more generous to his hard-luck characters."<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Horses and the Hounds|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/james-mcmurtry-the-horses-and-the-hounds/}}</ref>

McMurtry lives in [[Lockhart, Texas]], 30 miles south of [[Austin, Texas]] where, until recently, he and The [[Heartless Bastards]] regularly played a midnight set at The Continental Club on Wednesday nights after [[Jon Dee Graham]], another Austin roots rock musician.<ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry Remains The Harbinger Of American Truth|url=https://glidemagazine.com/228503/james-mcmurtry-remains-the-harbinger-of-american-truth-interview/|website=Glide Magazine|date=11 July 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry releases new live EP to benefit Continental Club|url=https://www.statesman.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/09/02/james-mcmurtry-releases-new-live-ep-to-benefit-continental-club/42521801/|website=Austin American-Statesman}}</ref>

McMurtry's son, Curtis, is also a singer-songwriter and has performed with his father, as well as filling in for his father's Tuesday night solo residency at The Continental Club when James is on tour.

'''Jay Stuart Farrar''' (born December 26, 1966) is an American songwriter and musician currently based in [[St. Louis]].  A member of two critically acclaimed music groups, [[Uncle Tupelo]] and [[Son Volt]], he began his solo music career in 2001.  Beyond his established talents as a songwriter, he is a guitarist, pianist, harmonicist, and a vocalist.

==Uncle Tupelo==
Farrar formed [[Uncle Tupelo]] with [[Jeff Tweedy]] and [[Mike Heidorn]] in 1987 after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primatives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album [[Anodyne (album)|''Anodyne'']], Farrar announced his decision to leave the band owing to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo is often mentioned as one of the originators of the [[Alternative country|alt-country]] genre of music or subgenre of country music that combines country, folk and/or bluegrass with punk rock, alt-rock, indie rock or other generes.

==Son Volt==
{{see also|Son Volt#Discography}}
After the dissolution of [[Uncle Tupelo]] in 1994, Farrar formed the rock group [[Son Volt]], whose original lineup released three albums in the late 1990s, before undergoing a hiatus in 1999. In 1999, Farrar was invited to participate in the [[tribute album]] for [[Moby Grape]] co-founder [[Skip Spence]], who was terminally ill with cancer. The album, ''[[More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album]] '' ([[Birdman Records|Birdman]], 1999), was an album of [[cover version]]s of the songs on Spence's only solo album, ''[[Oar (Skip Spence album)|Oar]]'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]], 1999). In 2005, the band re-formed with a different lineup and has since released seven additional albums.

{{see also|Jay Farrar discography}}
In 1995, Farrar collaborated with Kelly Willis on the song "Rex's Blues", which appeared on the [[AIDS]] benefit album [[Red Hot + Bothered]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

As a solo artist, Farrar has released two full-length albums, two EPs, one film score, and various live recordings.  His full-length albums are ''[[Sebastopol (album)|Sebastopol]]'' (2001) and ''[[Terroir Blues]]'' (2003), the first released on the [[independent record label]] Artemis Records and the second released on his own label, Transmit Sound.

An EP of songs from the ''Sebastopol'' sessions, entitled ''ThirdShiftGrottoSlack'' was released in 2002.  His score for the [[independent film]] ''The Slaughter Rule'' (2002, directors Alex and Andrew Smith) was released in 2003 on the independent record label Bloodshot Records.  Farrar formed his own independent record label in 2003, '''Transmit Sound''' (formerly called "Act/Resist Records").

In 2004, Farrar released a six-song live acoustic EP entitled ''Live EP''. Also 2004 marked the release of the live CD/DVD ''[[Stone, Steel & Bright Lights]]''.

Farrar worked closely with keyboardist [[Steven Drozd]] of [[The Flaming Lips]] during the recording of ''Sebastopol''. Eric Heywood, [[Mark Spencer (guitarist)|Mark Spencer]] from the [[Blood Oranges (band)|Blood Oranges]], and the rock group [[Canyon (indie rock band)|Canyon]] have often accompanied Farrar in his solo recordings and performances. Spencer is now a full-time member of Son Volt.

In 2006, Farrar announced the formation of a new band, [[Gob Iron]], with Varnaline's Anders Parker. The songs which would make up their debut album were recorded in autumn 2004, while Farrar was in the process of recording a new Son Volt album. In April 2019, Parker and Farrar released a [[single (music)|7-inch single]] using the Gob Iron moniker.

Farrar collaborated with [[Ben Gibbard]] (of the indie rock band [[Death Cab for Cutie]]) to create all of the music for the soundtrack for the 2009 documentary film ''One Fast Move or I'm Gone'', about [[Jack Kerouac]]'s time spent at [[Big Sur]]. The [[One Fast Move or I'm Gone|soundtrack]] was released on October 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267721/death-cabs-ben-gibbard-jay-farrar-team-up-for-kerouac-soundtrack|title="Death Cab's Ben Gibbard, Jay Farrar Team Up For Kerouac Soundtrack"|author=Michael D. Ayers|website=Billboard.com|access-date=13 August 2009}}</ref>

In 2012, Farrar, along with [[Will Johnson (musician)|Will&nbsp;Johnson]], [[Jim James|Yim&nbsp;Yames]], and [[Anders Parker]] collaborated on the [[Woody Guthrie]] archive project, ''[[New Multitudes]]''.

==Style==
His musical style ranges from sparse, unaccompanied [[folk music]] to full [[rock and roll]] band arrangements comparable to [[Neil Young]] or [[Dinosaur Jr.]] His solo recordings also often include sound experiments, reminiscent of psychedelia, with a distinct [[Eastern world|Eastern]] bent. One of the hallmarks of his sound is the use of alternate tunings on the [[guitar]]. His love for Woody Guthrie inspired a custom guitar made by [[Creston Electric Instruments|Creston Lea]] of Vermont. The guitar was made from artifacts Jay gathered from the site of Guthrie's childhood home.

'''Jeffrey Scot Tweedy''' (born August 25, 1967) is an American musician, singer songwriter, author, and record producer best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the band [[Wilco]]. Tweedy, originally from [[Belleville, Illinois]], began his music career in high school with his band The Plebes along with [[Jay Farrar]], also in the band. It became the [[alternative country]] band [[Uncle Tupelo]]. 

After Uncle Tupelo broke up Tweedy formed Wilco which found critical and commercial success, most notably with ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' and ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]''. The latter received a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] in 2005.

During his career Tweedy has released 20 studio albums including [[Uncle Tupelo#Discography|four with Uncle Tupelo]], [[Wilco discography#Studio albums|twelve with Wilco]], [[Sukierae|one with his son Spencer]], [[Together at Last|a solo acoustic album]], three solo studio albums, along with numerous collaborations with other musicians, most notably ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' with [[Billy Bragg]].<ref name="Kot-LHTD-2004">{{cite book|last1=Kot|first1=Greg|title=Wilco : Learning How To Die|url=https://archive.org/details/wilcolearninghowt00kotg|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-767-91558-8|edition=1.}}</ref><ref name="NYTimes-RockStar-2009">{{cite news|last1=Carr|first1=David|title=Torture-Free but Still a Rock Star|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/arts/music/05carr.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 1, 2009|archive-date=August 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821090505/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/arts/music/05carr.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tweedy's mother bought him his first guitar when he was six years old, although he did not begin to play it seriously until he was twelve. Apparently Tweedy told people that he knew how to play the guitar once he got his first guitar, even though he did not know how to play. 

When he was twelve, Tweedy was injured in a bicycle accident and was laid up for the summer. He decided to learn how to play a few chords before somebody "called him out" on the lie.<ref name="Kot-LHTD-2004" /> On an appearance of [[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]], he remembered attending an [[X (American band)|X]] concert as a youngster in [[St. Louis]]. Tweedy said [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] opened for the band. [[Paul Westerberg]], the guitarist and vocalist for The Replacements, fell off the stage while performing. Tweedy said while he can't think of a song which inspired him to be in music he thought it looked like fun to be in a band after seeing The Replacements at that show.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

In 1981, when Tweedy was fourteen years old, he befriended [[Jay Farrar]] during an English class at [[Belleville Township High School West]].<ref name="Kot-LHTD-2004" />{{rp|10}} All of the members of Farrar's family enjoyed playing music; he already knew [[rock and roll]] music very well. By that time, Tweedy was a fan of [[The Ramones]] and [[country music]] while Farrar enjoyed [[The Sex Pistols]].<ref name="NYTimes-LHTD-2004">{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Joe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/books/alt-country-roads.html|title=Alt-Country Roads: Wilco, Learning How to Die|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 13, 2004|access-date=November 29, 2012|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162252/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/books/alt-country-roads.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Tweedy attended [[Belleville Area College]] and [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]].<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />

== Career ==

=== Early music ===

In the early 1980s, Tweedy joined The Plebes, a [[rockabilly]] band, with brothers Wade and Dade Farrar which Tweedy joined in order to qualify for a battle of the bands competition. They won.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|10,17}}<ref name=OptionMag-HeartCountry-1993>{{cite news|last1=Fine|first1=Jason|title=Heart of the Country|url=http://www.gumbopages.com/music/uncle-tupelo/text/heart_of_the_country.html|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=[[Option (music magazine)|Option]]|date=Nov–Dec 1993|location=The Gumbo Pages|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162254/https://www.gumbopages.com/music/uncle-tupelo/text/heart_of_the_country.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Tweedy pushed The Plebes away from the rockabilly music that they had been playing, which caused Dade Farrar to leave the band. The band renamed themselves The Primitives in 1984, taking their name from a song by [[garage rock]] band The Groupies.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|18}}<ref>The band was also known as The Primatives due to a misprint on their business cards</ref> Wade Farrar sang lead vocals and played harmonica, Jay Farrar played guitar, Tweedy played bass guitar, and [[Mike Heidorn]] played drums. In late 1986, the band decided to change their name to Uncle Tupelo, because a more popular British band was also using the name "[[The Primitives]]".<ref name=NoDepression-liner-notes-2003>{{cite web|last1=Heidorn|first1=Mike|title=Liner notes for No Depression (2003 reissue)|url=http://www.factorybelt.net/nd_notes.htm|website=Factory Belt|access-date=August 20, 2014|date=January 2003|archive-date=January 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123082925/http://www.factorybelt.net/nd_notes.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The Primitives went on hiatus in 1986 after Wade Farrar left the band to finish his engineering degree at Southern Illinois University.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|22}} While waiting for Wade to return from campus, Farrar, Tweedy, and Heidorn formed Uncle Tupelo.

=== Uncle Tupelo (1987–1994) ===
{{main|Uncle Tupelo}}
At his parents' request, Tweedy attended several universities, but dropped out of all of them to concentrate on Uncle Tupelo. While [[wiktionary:moonlight|moonlighting]] as a record store clerk at Euclid Records in St. Louis,<ref name=RiverfrontTimes-SolidSoundFest-2011>{{cite news |last=Zaleski |first=Annie |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2011/01/euclid_records_wilco_solid_sound_festival_2011_pop-up_store.php |title=Euclid Records Having a "Pop-Up Store" at Wilco's Solid Sound Festival |work=[[Riverfront Times]] |date=January 19, 2011 |access-date=November 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821022731/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2011/01/euclid_records_wilco_solid_sound_festival_2011_pop-up_store.php |archive-date=August 21, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=StLouisMag-Redemption-2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/September-2011/Wilcos-Jeff-Tweedy-Finds-Redemption-in-Music/ |title=Wilco's Jeff Tweedy Finds Redemption in Music |work=[[St. Louis Magazine]] |date=September 2011 |access-date=November 29, 2012 |archive-date=February 5, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162257/https://www.stlmag.com/Wilcos-Jeff-Tweedy-Finds-Redemption-in-Music/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Tweedy met Tony Margherita. After Margherita saw the band perform at an acoustic concert in 1988, he decided to become the band's manager. The band began playing regular shows at Cicero's basement bar in the [[Delmar Loop]] near [[Washington University in St. Louis]] with other bands playing in a similar style.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|24–26}}<ref name=NoDepression-liner-notes-2003 /> Uncle Tupelo recorded a ten-track demo tape entitled ''Not Forever, Just For Now'' in 1989, attracting the attention of [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant/Rockville Records]]. The independent label signed the band, and Uncle Tupelo's first album, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', was released the next year.<ref name=NoDepression-liner-notes-2003 /> The [[No Depression in Heaven|title song]], originally performed by the [[Carter Family]], became strongly associated with the [[alternative country]] scene, and became the name of an influential alternative country periodical called ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]].''

During times when Uncle Tupelo was not touring, Tweedy and Farrar played as Coffee Creek, a short-lived cover band with [[The Bottle Rockets]]' [[Brian Henneman]] and Mark Ortmann.<ref name=Request-AreYouReady-1993>{{cite news|last1=Durchholz|first1=Daniel|title=Are You Ready for the Country?|url=http://www.gumbopages.com/music/uncle-tupelo/text/are_you_ready.html|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=Request Magazine|date=November 1993|location=The Gumbo Pages|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162256/https://www.gumbopages.com/music/uncle-tupelo/text/are_you_ready.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Around this time, Tweedy began developing problems with alcohol, leading to tensions between Tweedy and Farrar. While he never refused to play a gig, Tweedy was forced to sit out in place of Henneman at some performances. Tweedy quit drinking entirely after meeting future wife Sue Miller, although he replaced this habit with smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. However, after developing a dependence on marijuana, he quickly quit using it, as well.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|51–53,95}} After releasing ''[[Still Feel Gone]]'', the band formed a friendship with [[Peter Buck]] of [[R.E.M.]], who produced their third album ''[[March 16–20, 1992]]'' for free.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 /> Uncle Tupelo left the Rockville label in favor of [[Sire Records]] ([[Warner Brothers|Warner]]) later in 1992 because Rockville refused to pay the band any royalties for their albums.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|72}} After the signing, [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]] and [[John Stirratt]] joined the band as Mike Heidorn was replaced by Bill Belzer who was later replaced by [[Ken Coomer]].<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|74–75}} The five-piece band recorded ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'', which sold over 150,000 copies and debuted at number 18 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, but was the last album Uncle Tupelo released.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|80}}<ref name=Billboard-Heatseekers-1993>{{cite magazine|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 23, 1993}}</ref>

==== Breakup ====
In January 1994, Farrar called Tony Margherita to tell him that the band was breaking up, saying that he was not having any fun in the band anymore and was not getting along with Tweedy. Tweedy was enraged that Farrar decided to break up the band without notifying him, and this led to a series of harsh verbal exchanges. Farrar and Tweedy agreed to a final Uncle Tupelo tour, but the concerts were marred by the two not participating in each other's songs. The band decided to play Tweedy's "The Long Cut" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', which further distanced Farrar and Tweedy.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|80–84}} Farrar began to assemble a new band named [[Son Volt]] with Mike Heidorn, bassist Jim Boquist, and his brother Dave Boquist. At the same time, Jeff Tweedy formed [[Wilco]] with Stirratt, Johnston, and Coomer.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|88,90}}

=== Wilco (1995–present) ===
{{main|Wilco}}
In 1994, Tweedy formed [[Wilco]] with [[John Stirratt]], [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]], and [[Ken Coomer]]. Wilco has released twelve albums and found commercial success with their albums ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'', ''[[Sky Blue Sky]]'' and ''[[Wilco (The Album)|Wilco]]''. The band also released two collaboration albums with [[Billy Bragg]] and one with [[The Minus 5]]. Jeff Tweedy has been the recipient of two [[Grammy Awards]], including Best Alternative Album for ''A Ghost Is Born''. Tweedy has also participated in a number of side groups including [[Golden Smog]] and [[Loose Fur]], published a book of poems, and released a DVD of solo performances. He was originally influenced by punk and country music, but has later reflected more experimental themes in his music.

[[File:Wilco - Roskilde Festival 2007.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tweedy singing with Wilco in 2007]]
Wilco signed with [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]] and began recording ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|AM]]'' almost as soon as the band was formed.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|89–91}} After recording, Tweedy was introduced to [[Jay Bennett]], who then joined the band. Also during this time, Tweedy quit smoking marijuana after a particularly bad experience with some [[cannabis brownie]]s.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|94–96}} ''A.M.'' did not fare as well commercially in comparison to Son Volt's first album, only reaching number 27 on the Heatseekers chart while Son Volt's debut ''[[Trace (Son Volt album)|Trace]]'' hit the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=Billboard-Heatseekers-1995>{{cite magazine|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 15, 1995}}</ref><ref name=Billboard-SonVolt>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/son-volt/chart-history/|title=Artist Chart History – Son Volt|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 29, 2006|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162256/https://www.billboard.com/c/music/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Dan Murphy (musician)|Dan Murphy]] of [[Soul Asylum]] invited Tweedy to join him in a supergroup named [[Golden Smog]] with [[Gary Louris]] and Marc Perlman of the [[Jayhawks (band)|Jayhawks]], Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run, and Noah Levy of [[The Honeydogs]]. Under the pseudonym Scott Summit, Tweedy released ''[[Down by the Old Mainstream]]'' with Golden Smog in 1996.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|105–106}}

Tweedy and Wilco began to explore new styles and broke from the style of previous recordings on the seminal sprawling double album ''[[Being There (Wilco album)|Being There]]'' in 1996. Tweedy did not write music for many of the songs ahead of time, and welcomed unexpected sounds into the recording. Wilco recorded nineteen songs for the double-CD album, and wanted the label to release it with a retail price comparable to a single-CD release.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|113,116}} ''Being There'' was a commercial success, selling 300,000 copies and peaking in the top half of the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/wilco/chart-history/|title=Artist Chart History – Wilco (albums)|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 29, 2006|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162258/https://www.billboard.com/artist/wilco/chart-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> Reprise records invested $100,000 in the single "Outta Mind (Outtasite)", but received little radio exposure.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|125}}<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/wilco/chart-history/|title=Artist Chart History – Wilco (singles)|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 29, 2006|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162258/https://www.billboard.com/artist/wilco/chart-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> While on tour, Tweedy began to spend time reading books by [[William H.

As he read their books, Tweedy decided to place more of an emphasis on writing.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|136}} Representatives in the A&R department of Reprise wanted a radio single from ''Summerteeth'', and Wilco reluctantly agreed to a re-working of "[[Can't Stand It]]".

Before the release of ''Summerteeth'', the daughter of the late folk legend Woody Guthrie contacted [[folk rock]] singer [[Billy Bragg]], who in turn contacted Tweedy about recording an album of unreleased [[Woody Guthrie]] songs. Tweedy was indifferent to the idea of working with Bragg, but Jay Bennett's enthusiasm about the idea convinced Tweedy to get the band involved in the project. As a result of Tweedy's feelings on the political nature of some of the lyrics, Bragg recorded mostly political songs while Wilco recorded more neutral songs. Almost all of the songs that appeared on ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' and ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]'' were recorded over a six-day period in December 1997.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|142–145}} The first ''Mermaid Avenue'' album and a second Golden Smog album (''[[Weird Tales (album)|Weird Tales]]'') were released in 1998, ''Summerteeth'' was released in early 1999, and ''Mermaid Avenue Vol. II'' was released in 2000.

==== ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' ====
[[File:Wilco MassMoca AustinNelson.jpg|left|thumb|Wilco at MassMoca]]
Jeff Tweedy was invited to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, and was told that he could collaborate with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] based on his fascination with O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (Jim O'Rourke album)|Bad Timing]]'' album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer [[Glenn Kotche]] to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named [[Loose Fur]]. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|176–183,188}} Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments between songs about how the album should sound. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|197–200}}<ref name=IATTBYH-Documentary-2006>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|title=I Am Trying To Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|date=2006|publisher=Plexigroup|location=New York|oclc=68940599}}</ref> Tweedy also fired Bennett around this time, believing (according to Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member.<ref name=IATTBYH-Documentary-2006 /> The band maintains that the firing of Bennett was a collective decision.<ref name=Pitchfork-Interview-2007>{{cite news|last1=Crock|first1=Jason|title=Interviews: Wilco|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6602-wilco/|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|date=May 7, 2007|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162803/https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6602-wilco/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Reprise Records' parent company [[Time Warner]] merged with [[America Online]] in 2001, and the recording company was asked to cut costs. [[Howie Klein]], the CEO of Reprise Records, considered Wilco to be one of the label's core bands, but was offered a lucrative buy-out by AOL Time Warner. Reprise did not consider the album commercially viable and was not interested in releasing the album. David Kahne (Head of A&R) agreed to release Wilco from Reprise under the condition that Wilco got to keep all legal entitlements to the ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' album.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|201–207}}<ref name=IATTBYH-Documentary-2006 /> After an article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' publicly described these managerial practices, CEO Gary Briggs quit.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|208–209}} Shortly after leaving the label, Briggs remarked:

''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' was originally scheduled to be released on Reprise on September 11, 2001, prior to the band's departure from Reprise.

[[Scott McCaughey]] contacted Tweedy about recording an album together for a [[The Minus 5]] release. They scheduled a meeting for September 11, 2001, but were reluctant to enter the recording studio after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]]. At night, McCaughey and Tweedy decided to begin recording songs as a way to calm down. A few more tracks were later added to the album with the rest of Wilco, and it was released with the name ''[[Down with Wilco]]'' in 2003.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|220–222}}

In November 2003, Wilco began recording a fifth studio album. Unlike their previous albums, all of the songs were originally performed in the studio and then later adapted for playing at concerts. Wilco released ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'' on June 22, 2004, and it attained a top ten peak on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=MTVNews-Charts-2004>{{cite web|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489256/20040707/story.jhtml|title=Lloyd Banks' Hunger Debuts At #1; Brandy Settles For #3|work=[[MTV News]]|date=July 7, 2004|access-date=November 29, 2012|archive-date=December 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220232139/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489256/20040707/story.jhtml|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album was awarded with Grammy Awards for [[Best Alternative Music Album]] and [[Best Recording Package]] in 2005.<ref name=AP-Grammys-2005>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2005-grammy-award-winners/|title=2005 Grammy Award Winners: Complete List Of 47th Annual Grammy Awards Winners|agency=Associated Press|date=February 13, 2005|work=[[CBS News]]|access-date=December 28, 2006|archive-date=June 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620131904/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/14/in_depth_showbiz/main673822.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> A few weeks before the album's release, Tweedy released a book of forty-three poems entitled ''Adult Head'' on Zoo Press.<ref name=ChicagoSunTimes-Poetic-2004>{{cite news|last=DeRogatis|first=Jim|url=http://www.jimdero.com/News2004/May9RockPoetry.htm|title=Poetic license or verbal abuse?|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=May 9, 2004|access-date=November 29, 2012|archive-date=February 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205162803/http://www.jimdero.com/News2004/May9RockPoetry.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The following year, the band released their first live album, a two-disc set entitled ''[[Kicking Television: Live in Chicago]]'', recorded at [[The Vic Theater]].<ref>''Kicking Television: Live in Chicago'' liner notes</ref>

Tweedy's vocal style is considered nasal, emotional, and raspy, and has been compared to that of [[Neil Young]].<ref name=NYTimes-LHTD-2004 /><ref name=BBC-AGIB-2002>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Chris|title=Wilco – A Ghost Is Born|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/m34h/|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=[[BBC]]|date=November 20, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530034932/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/m34h/|archive-date=May 30, 2008}}</ref> His first exposure to music was through [[gramophone record]]s that his siblings left behind when they attended college, and he particularly liked [[The Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]. Tweedy would frequently read issues of magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and began to purchase [[punk rock]] albums such as [[The Clash]]'s ''[[London Calling]]'' and [[X (U.S. band)|X]]'s ''[[Wild Gift]]''. Belleville crowds did not respond well to punk music, so while Tweedy was a member of The Primitives they played covers of [[country music|country]] songs at much faster tempos.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|13–19}}  When Uncle Tupelo formed, the band began composing its own songs influenced by [[Jason & the Scorchers]] and [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]].<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 /> Wilco's first album shared many musical similarities with the four previous Uncle Tupelo albums, but on ''Being There'', Tweedy began introducing more experimental themes into his music. He claims that he wanted to rebel against the belief spread by the ''No Depression'' magazine that Wilco was primarily a country band.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|110–111}} One of the most influential albums for Tweedy was ''[[Bad Timing (Jim O'Rourke album)|Bad Timing]]'' by Jim O'Rourke, which helped to inspire ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' and ''A Ghost Is Born''.<ref name=Kot-LHTD-2004 />{{rp|176–177}} Tweedy uses a 1957 Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar, as well as a 1965 Fender Jazzmaster, at least three different Telecasters, an Epiphone Casino, a Rickenbacker 360, and a Gibson SG Standard. He has vintage SGs from '62 and '65 as well as a 2007 Custom Shop model and a 2008 Custom Shop Vintage Original Spec (V.O.S.) that are all rigged with Maestro tremolo bars.<ref name=Gibson-Sound-2009>{{cite news|last=Drozdowski|first=Ted|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/ProductSpotlight/Tone-Tips/how-to-get-wilcos-live-420/|title=How to Get Wilco's Live Guitar Sound|work=[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]|date=April 20, 2009|access-date=November 29, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907150018/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/ProductSpotlight/Tone-Tips/how-to-get-wilcos-live-420/|archive-date=September 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He also has been known to use a Breedlove 000<ref name=GuitarWorld-RadioHead-2002>{{cite news|last=Beaujour|first=Tom|title=Radio Head|work=[[Guitar World]]|date=June 2002}}</ref> and even designed a limited edition 000 for Breedlove in 2007.<ref name=PremierGuitar-Breedlove-2007>{{cite news|title=Breedlove's Jeff Tweedy Guitar|work=[[Premier Guitar]]|date=November 20, 2007}}</ref> His amplifier of choice is a Vox AC30.

'''Joe Ely''' ({{IPA|/ˈiːli/|lang=en}}; born February 9, 1947)<ref name="AMG"/> is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He was "one of the main movers" of [[Austin, Texas]]'s [[progressive country]] scene in the 1970s and '80s.<ref name="AMG"/>

He has had a genre-crossing career, performing with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Uncle Tupelo]], [[Los Super Seven]], [[The Chieftains]] and [[James McMurtry]] in addition to his early work with [[The Clash]] and more recent acoustic tours with [[Lyle Lovett]], [[John Hiatt]], and [[Guy Clark]].

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
He was born in [[Amarillo, Texas]].<ref name="AMG" /> Ely spent his formative years from age 12 in [[Lubbock, Texas]],<ref name="AMG" /> and attended [[Monterey High School (Lubbock, Texas)|Monterey High School]].

In 1971, with fellow Lubbock musicians [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] and [[Butch Hancock]], he formed [[the Flatlanders]].<ref name="AMG"/> According to Ely, "Jimmie [Gilmore] was like a well of country music. He knew everything about it. And Butch was from the folk world. I was kinda the rock & roll guy, and we almost had a triad. We hit it off and started playing a lot together. That opened up a whole new world I had never known existed."

In 1972, the band recorded their first album.<ref name="AMG"/> Because the band's initial breakup occurred just after their first album was cut, the three musicians have followed individual paths, but have appeared together on each other's albums.  They reformed for 2002's ''Now Again''.

===Solo career===
Ely's own [[Joe Ely (album)|first, self-titled album]], was released in 1977.<ref name="AMG"/>

The following year, his band played London, where he met [[punk rock]] group [[the Clash]].<ref name="AMG"/> Impressed with each other's performances, the two bands later toured together, including appearances in Ely's hometown of Lubbock, as well as [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and [[Ciudad Juárez]] in Mexico, across the border from [[El Paso, Texas]].<ref name="AMG"/> The Clash paid tribute to Joe Ely by including the lyrics "Well there ain't no better blend than Joe Ely and his Texas Men" in the lyrics of their song "If Music Could Talk," which was released in 1980 on the album ''[[Sandinista!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tpz4boqtvplqe57524ilps6qjei?lyrics=1 |title=Google Play Music |website=Play.google.com |access-date=July 9, 2017}}</ref> Ely sang backing vocals on the Clash single "[[Should I Stay or Should I Go?]]". [[Joe Strummer]] planned to record with Ely's band, but died before that ever happened—one of Ely's greatest regrets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ickmusic.com/2006/07/18/london-to-lubbock-joe-ely-meets-the-clash/ |title=London to Lubbock: Joe Ely meets the Clash |website=Ickmusic.com |access-date=December 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827173014/http://ickmusic.com/2006/07/18/london-to-lubbock-joe-ely-meets-the-clash/ |archive-date=August 27, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another collaboration was with Dutch [[flamenco]] guitarist [[Teye]], with whom he recorded ''Letter to Laredo'' (1995)<ref>

Throughout his career, Ely has issued a steady stream of albums, most on the [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] label, and a live album roughly every ten years.

On May 1, 1982, Joe Ely put on the Third Annual Tornado Jam in [[Lubbock, Texas]] to a crowd of 25,000. The Jam included [[Leon Russell]], [[Joan Jett]] and [[The Crickets]]. The first Tornado Jam was fundraiser to help [[Lubbock, Texas]] after [[Lubbock tornado|the Tornado]], thus the name. The second Annual Tornado Jam had a crowd of 35,000.<ref>''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', May 1, 1982, p. 30</ref>

In the late 1990s, Ely was asked to write songs for the soundtrack of [[Robert Redford]]'s movie ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', which led to re-forming [[The Flatlanders]] with Gilmore and Hancock.<ref name="AMG"/> A new album from the trio followed in 2002, with a third in 2004.<ref name="AMG"/>
[[File:Joe Ely 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ely in 2008]]
In February 2007, Ely released ''Happy Songs From Rattlesnake Gulch'' on his own label, Rack 'Em Records.<ref name="AMG"/> Ely said in an interview with [[Country Standard Time]] that he thought it would be easier to release the material on his own label, instead of dealing with a regular record label and their release cycles. A book of Ely's writings, ''Bonfire of Roadmaps'', was published in early 2007 by the [[University of Texas Press]]. In early 2008, Ely released a new live album featuring Joel Guzman on [[accordion]] recorded at the Cactus Cafe in Austin, Texas in late 2006.

The [[The Flatlanders|Flatlanders]] released their newest album ''Hills and Valleys'' on March 31, 2009.

In 2011, Ely released the critically acclaimed album, ''Satisfied at Last''.<ref name="AMG"/>

In September 2015, Ely released ''Panhandle Rambler,'' an album with a reflective [[west Texas]] feel. Lonestar Music Magazine says "the title fits the record just right, neatly framing a dozen songs that fit together thematically like a map of both the West Texas landscape and of Ely's epic decades-spanning musical ramble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/joe-ely-panhandle-rambler/|title=Joe Ely: "Panhandle Rambler" – Lone Star Music Magazine|website=Lonestarmusicmagazine.com|date=December 24, 2015 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref>

Ely spent 2016 as the reigning "Texas State Musician", a one-year designation which he formally accepted in a ceremony at the State Legislature that spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statesman.com/news/20160904/panhandle-rambler-rides-on-joe-ely-on-his-new-album-and-more|title='Panhandle Rambler' rides on: Joe Ely on his new album and more|first=Peter|last=Blackstock|website=Statesman.com|access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref>

In October 2022, he was inducted to the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame
[[Austin City Limits]].

==Lawsuit against Universal Music Group==
On February 5, 2019, Ely and [[John Waite]] filed a class-action lawsuit against [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG) claiming the company is violating their right to terminate grants of copyright after 35 years in accordance with [[copyright law of the United States]] by ignoring Notices of Termination. May 3, 2019, UMG filed a motion to dismiss the case, stating the Notices of Termination were not valid because the songs were not grants of copyright but [[work for hire|works for hire]].<ref name=LeoFre>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6rSPdgGMQs |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211219/n6rSPdgGMQs |archive-date=2021-12-19 |url-status=live|title=Music Industry Opposes Copyright Termination; What is it?|first=Leonard|last=French|work=Lawful Masses with Leonard French|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=May 18, 2018|access-date=May 18, 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=DMN>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/05/07/universal-music-group-v-copyright-act/|title=Universal Music Is Battling to Nullify the 35-Year Copyright Termination Right|first=Daniel|last=Sanchez|website=Digitalmusicnews.com|date=May 7, 2018|access-date=May 18, 2018}}</ref>

==Music career==
In 1999, Edwards recorded a six-song EP entitled ''Building 55'' and pressed 500 copies. By the fall of 2000, she was on tour across Canada managing her own gigs. In 2001, she wrote seven of the ten songs for her 2002 debut release ''Failer''.

Edwards played at [[SXSW]] in 2002 and was signed to Rounder Records and MapleMusic shortly after. ''Failer'' was released in Canada in the fall of 2002 on [[MapleMusic Recordings]].<ref>[http://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/17548/cohen-gould-buffy-25-best-canadian-debut-albums "25 best Canadian debut albums ever"]. ''CBC Music'', June 16, 2017.</ref>  In January 2003 ''Failer'' was released by [[Rounder Records]] in the US and internationally.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' declared her one of year's most promising new acts and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' said that ''Failer''{{'s}} songs possessed "an indefinable pull that makes you love the characters they describe, no matter how fucked up they are." ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Edwards as a writer whose songs can "pare situations down to a few dozen words while they push country-rock towards its primal impulses of thump and twang."  She made  her television network debut on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' where she performed "Six O'Clock News."

In 2005, Edwards released ''[[Back to Me (Kathleen Edwards album)|Back to Me]]'', which also garnered considerable critical acclaim, and led to the release of the singles "Back to Me" and "In State". The track "Summerlong" was also featured on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' starring [[Orlando Bloom]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]].

Edwards stepped back from the music scene in 2014, launching a coffee house in [[Stittsville]] called Quitters along with Rick Tremblay (who was her manager when she worked in a downtown Starbucks in the 1990s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/local-arts/no-quitter-kathleen-edwards-finds-a-new-path-in-stittsville-coffee-shop|title=No quitter: Kathleen Edwards finds a new path in Stittsville coffee shop|website=Ottawa Citizen|access-date=December 31, 2015|ref=quitters}}</ref> She insisted that she is not leaving music but just taking a break, and that the name Quitters is "kind of tongue-in-cheek".

== Life and career ==
Wetzel was born in [[Pittsburg, Texas]], with one of his names being a reference to outlaw country singer-songwriter [[David Allan Coe]].<ref name=":0" /> His mother was a touring country singer, bringing the young Koe along and his father worked in construction. He would perform on stage for the first time at age six.<ref name=":4" /> Later, Wetzel was a [[linebacker]] at [[Tarleton State University]] in [[Stephenville, Texas]], where he decided to pursue a career as a musician instead.<ref name=":0" />

Wetzel formed "Koe Wetzel and Konvicts", and self-released an EP and one full-length album. His "rowdy" music and lyrics became popular among college students and young adults, and ''Noise Complaint,'' released in 2016, was considered to be his breakout album.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Koe Wetzel: Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/koe-wetzel-mn0003724456/biography|access-date=2021-07-02|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref> Beginning with ''Noise Complaint'', the full name of the band was dropped, though Wetzel still performs with a bassist, one drummer, and two guitarists.<ref>{{Cite web|title=KOE WETZEL|url=https://www.chilifest.org/koe-wetzel/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=Chilifest 2020 Official Website|language=en-US}}</ref> The band signed with Red 11 Music in Austin, TX in early 2018 while being managed by 4-Tay Management out of Stephenville, TX until 2019 when the band signed a management deal with Floating Leaf Entertainment, establishing a joint venture between Wetzel and Jeb Hurt who had previously been the band's agent at Red 11 Music.

''Harold Saul High'' was released in 2019 to mixed reviews,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trigger|date=2019-06-24|title=Album Review – Koe Wetzel's "Harold Saul High"|url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/album-review-koe-wetzels-harold-saul-high/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=Saving Country Music|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Fox|first=Chris|date=2019-06-19|title=Koe Wetzel Earns High Marks in "Harold Saul High" {{!}}|url=http://texasmusicpickers.com/koe-wetzel-earns-high-marks-in-harold-saul-high/|access-date=2021-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kephart|first=Zackary|date=2019-06-27|title=Album Review: Koe Wetzel – 'Harold Saul High'|url=https://themusicaldivide.com/2019/06/27/album-review-koe-wetzel-harold-saul-high/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=The Musical Divide|language=en}}</ref> however sales were strong, and the album charted on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name=":3" />

In 2020, Wetzel released ''Sellout'', named in reference to his signing with major label [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|date=2020-12-01|title=Koe Wetzel Reassures the Masses That He'll Never Change on 'Sellout'|url=https://americansongwriter.com/koe-wetzel-reassures-the-masses-that-hell-never-change-on-sellout/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2023, Wetzel became<ref>{{Cite web|date=2023-01-19|title=Fort Worth hospitality vets partner with musician Koe Wetzel on new country venue|url=https://fortworth.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/koe-wetzel-riot-room-emil-bragdon/|access-date=2024-05-08|website=CultureMap Fort Worth|language=en-US}}</ref> a partner in the opening of a highly successful restaurant-bar and live music review in Fort Worth, Texas called Koe Wetzel's Riot Room.

== Musical style ==
Wetzel's music is usually described as fusing genres, especially rock and country while he has been rumored to personally refer to his blend of music as "Hillbilly Punk-Rock". In his youth, Wetzel was exposed to country, hip-hop, rap, and grunge including the music of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. In an interview for ''[[American Songwriter]]'', Wetzel described his album ''Harold Saul High'' as "...90s country meets early 2000s [[punk rock]] with early ’90s [[grunge]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] music in the background."<ref name=":5" />

His lyrics often deal with mature subject matter, and are known for containing explicit language.<ref name=":1" /> One example is the song "February 28, 2016": a song about drunkenness, and a reference to his arrest for [[public intoxication]] in Stephenville on that day.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Langeler|first=Wes|date=2021-02-28|title=Happy February 28th, AKA Koe Wetzel Day|url=https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2021/02/28/happy-february-28th-aka-koe-wetzel-day/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=Whiskey Riff|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2019, Wetzel's performance at the [[Great Texas Balloon Race]] was the subject of some controversy, after some festival goers were offended at his refusal to make his songs more family friendly. Wetzel responded in a [[Tongue-in-cheek|tongue in cheek]] manner, taking credit for breaking attendance records.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-30|title=Koe Wetzel throws shade at Great Texas Balloon Race over apology|url=https://www.ketk.com/news/local-news/koe-wetzel-throws-shade-at-great-texas-balloon-race-over-apology/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=KETK.com {{!}} FOX51.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

'''Lucinda Gayl Williams'''{{efn|Some sources spell her middle name as Gayle.}} (born January 26, 1953)<ref name=allmusicbio/> is an American singer-songwriter and a solo guitarist. She recorded her first two albums, ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind (Lucinda Williams album)|Ramblin' on My Mind]]'' (1979) and ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'' (1980), in a traditional country and blues style that received critical praise but little public or radio attention.

Williams' commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and [[Americana music|Americana]] into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', which includes the singles "[[Right in Time]]" and the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy nominated]] "[[Can't Let Go (Randy Weeks song)|Can't Let Go]]", became Williams' greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified [[Music recording certification#Certification thresholds|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] the following year, and earned her a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams' next album, ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', appeared in 2001 to further critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming her first Top 40 album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No. 28. Featuring a more downbeat musical tone, with spare, intimate arrangements, ''Essence'' earned Williams three Grammy nominations in [[44th Annual Grammy Awards|2002]]: Best Contemporary Folk Album, [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for the [[Essence (Lucinda Williams song)|title track]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single "[[Get Right With God]]", which she won.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1845783.stm "Grammys 2002: The winners"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023073633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1845783.stm |date=October 23, 2013 }}.

==Early life==
Williams was born in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], the daughter of poet and literature professor [[Miller Williams]], and amateur pianist Lucille Fern Day. Her parents divorced in the mid-1960s. Williams' father gained custody of her and her younger brother, Robert Miller, and sister, Karyn Elizabeth. Like her father, Williams has [[spina bifida]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/magazine/01wwln-domains-t.html |title=Domains : Lucinda Williams : Country House |author=Lewine, Edward |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 26, 2009 |access-date=April 24, 2014 |archive-date=February 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227160518/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/magazine/01wwln-domains-t.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Her father worked as a visiting professor in Mexico and different parts of the United States, including [[Baton Rouge]]; [[New Orleans]]; [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; and [[Utah]] before settling at the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]. Williams never graduated from high school but was accepted into the University of Arkansas.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Buford |first1=Bill |title=Delta Nights: A Singer's Love Affair with Loss |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/06/05/delta-nights |access-date=July 22, 2014 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=June 5, 2000 |archive-date=July 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725192211/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/06/05/delta-nights |url-status=live}}</ref> Williams started writing when she was 6 years old. She showed an affinity for music at an early age, and was playing guitar at 12. Her first live performance was in Mexico City at 17, as part of a duo with her friend, banjo player Clark Jones.<ref>Bukowski, Elizabeth.

==Career==
===1978–1987: Early career===
By her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[Houston]], Texas, concentrating on a blend of [[Folk music|folk]], rock, and [[Country music|country]]. She moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], in 1978 to record her first album for [[Folkways Records]]. Released in 1979, and titled ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind (Lucinda Williams album)|Ramblin' on My Mind]]'', it was a collection of country and [[blues]] covers. [[Smithsonian Folkways]] provides a description: "The first recordings from an artist with a gift for interpreting original blues from [[Robert Johnson]] to [[Memphis Minnie]] to the [[Carter Family]]. Williams' unmistakable sound is powerfully direct and filled with melancholy and passion."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://folkways.si.edu/lucinda-williams/ramblin/american-folk-country/music/album/smithsonian |title=Ramblin' on My Mind – Lucinda Williams |website=[[Smithsonian Folkways]] |access-date=February 13, 2018 |archive-date=January 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109205755/https://folkways.si.edu/lucinda-williams/ramblin/american-folk-country/music/album/smithsonian |url-status=live}}</ref> When the album was re-issued in 1991, the title was shortened to ''Ramblin'''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wolff |first=Kurt |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ramblin-mw0000274511 |title=Ramblin' |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 10, 2005 |archive-date=June 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610072313/http://www.allmusic.com/album/ramblin-mw0000274511 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Williams' second album, ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'', appeared the following year, and consisted of her own material. ''[[Trouser Press]]'' felt the record was more "rock-oriented" than Williams' debut album, writing that she used timeworn ideas such as "smoke-stained bars, open roads and a heart that never learns" but reimagined them "in a way that is both contemporary and uncynical".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=lucinda_williams |title=Lucinda Williams |work=Trouser Press |access-date=September 3, 2015 |archive-date=October 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012194743/http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=lucinda_williams |url-status=live}}</ref> One album track, "I Lost It", was re-recorded 18 years later for Williams' fifth album ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'' (1998). In the 1980s, Williams moved to Los Angeles, California (before finally settling in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]] drummer [[Greg Sowders]], whom she had met in a club.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/14/magazine/lucinda-williams-is-in-pain.html |last=Frey |first=Darcy |title=Lucinda Williams is in pain |website=The New York Times |date=September 14, 1997 |access-date=May 26, 2020 |archive-date=June 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603195229/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/14/magazine/lucinda-williams-is-in-pain.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

===1988–1997: ''Lucinda Williams'', ''Sweet Old World'', and critical acclaim===
In 1988, Williams released her third album, ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]'', on [[Rough Trade Records]].

===2000–2003: ''Essence'' and ''World Without Tears''===
Williams followed up the success of ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' with ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', released on June 5, 2001. Featuring a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, ''Essence'' moved Williams further from the country music establishment, while winning fans in the alternative music world. The album received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album in [[44th Annual Grammy Awards|2002]], while Williams won the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single "[[Get Right With God]]", an atypically up-tempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release. The [[Essence (Lucinda Williams song)|title track]] includes a contribution on a Hammond organ by [[alternative country]] musician [[Ryan Adams]], and earned Williams a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. At the same ceremony, Williams was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her cover of "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]", from the all-star [[Hank Williams]] tribute album, ''Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute'' (2001).<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000014218|label=''Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute'' – Various Artists|access-date=7 July 2014}}</ref> On January 13, 2002, Williams performed with [[Elvis Costello]] on the inaugural episode of ''[[CMT Crossroads]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Michael |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/articles/a-c/cmt.011206a.html |title=Costello, Williams Tape Crossroads Session for CMT |website=The Elvis Costello Home Page |access-date=October 10, 2021 |archive-date=October 10, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010171037/http://www.elviscostello.info/articles/a-c/cmt.011206a.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Later that year, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine christened Williams "America's best songwriter",<ref name=time/> and [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] ranked her No. 36 on its list of the 40 Greatest Women of Country Music.<ref name=cmt40>{{Citation |url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/76608/episode_countdown.jhtml |title=CMT's 40 Greatest Women of Country Music |publisher=[[CMT (American TV channel)|Country Music Television]] |access-date=October 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414142311/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/76608/episode_countdown.jhtml |archive-date=April 14, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Some of his other film roles include ''[[Bastard out of Carolina (film)|Bastard Out Of Carolina]]'' (1996), ''[[The New Guy]]'' (2002), ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' (2007), and a humorous role in ''[[Angels Sing]]'', a family Christmas movie (alongside fellow actors and musicians such as [[Harry Connick, Jr.]], [[Connie Britton]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1833888/ |title=Angels Sing |publisher=IMDb|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> His television acting forays include guest roles on ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', a recurring role on ''[[The Bridge (2013 TV series)|The Bridge]]'' (as Flagman, a lawyer), and appearances as himself on ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' and ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.

Lovett was given an award called an "Esky" for Surest Thing in [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire's]] 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue. The magazine said of Lovett: "The secret of Lyle Lovett's endurance comes down to the three C's: class, [[charisma]] and consistency... In the studio and on stage with his giant orchestra, he's spent two decades gracefully matching genuine songcraft with A-list musicianship".

In 2010, Lovett appeared on an episode of ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]'' that also featured [[John Prine]] and [[Ray LaMontagne]].

In 2011, Lovett was named ''Texas State Artist Musician ''by the Texas Commission on the Arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.texas.gov/initiatives/texas-state-artist/state-musician/ |title=State Musician &#124; Texas Commission on the Arts |website=Arts.texas.gov |access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref>

'''Martha Elenor Maguire''' (née '''Erwin''', previously '''Seidel'''; October 12, 1969) is an American musician who is a founding member of the country band [[the Chicks]] and the country bluegrass duo [[Court Yard Hounds]]. She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Maguire is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.

Maguire learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, [[Emily Strayer]] (born Emily Erwin) and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]] and Robin Lynn Macy, forming a bluegrass and country music band, [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer [[Natalie Maines]], the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with 19 singles hitting the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Charts]], 2 Diamond Albums, 2 Platinum albums, and 13 [[Grammy Awards]].  Maguire subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in a 2003 controversy for [[Dixie Chicks controversy|criticizing George W. Bush]], which led to the Chicks being [[blacklisted]] by many country radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |title=Chicks in the Line of Fire |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1196419,00.html |access-date=October 5, 2022 |publisher=Time Magazine |date=May 21, 2006}}</ref>

Encouraged by her parents &ndash; educators at private schools &ndash; Maguire began playing violin at age five, and by age 12, started to learn to play "[[fiddle]] style" after receiving a birthday gift of fiddle lessons.<ref name="Ladies Home Journal">[http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/martiemaguirecelebprofile_01132003.xml]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> She also was active in her school orchestra.<ref name="Gilchriest">[http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219045902/http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm|date=December 19, 2007}}</ref>

Her sister Emily shared her love and interest in music, and displayed early talent herself. The two sisters were provided musical instruction on several instruments, and their talent for [[vocal harmony]] continued to be nurtured. Although Maguire became famous for her harmony and mastery of the fiddle, she also plays a variety of [[String instrument|strings]] that include the [[viola]], guitar, [[mandolin]], and double bass.<ref name=Leggett>Leggett, Steve [https://archive.today/20130104003115/http://music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16649328&menu=bio All-Music Guide writer on MSN] (Retrieved March 9, 2008)</ref> Maguire [[Composer|compose]]s songs and [[arrangement|arrange]]s the use of [[stringed instrument]]s for concert and recording performances.

==The Chicks==
[[File:Martie Maguire by ViVr.jpg|thumb|left| Maguire at [[Royal Albert Hall]], 2003]]
In 1989, Maguire and Strayer joined guitarist Robin Lynn Macy and [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]] on double bass in the [[Dixie Chicks]], playing what was at the time predominantly [[bluegrass music]] and a mix of [[Country music|country]] standards. Originally listed as Martha, and then Martie Erwin, Maguire played [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[viola]] and [[Harmony|harmonized]] with Strayer on backing vocals.<ref name="Superior">{{cite web |url=http://www.superiorpics.com/martie_maguire/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203175101/http://www.superiorpics.com/martie_maguire/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |title=The Martie Maguire Picture Pages |publisher=Superiorpics.com |access-date=2014-07-15 }}</ref>

Maguire had begun writing and recording songs on their debut independent album, ''[[Thank Heavens for Dale Evans]]'', and in 2001, one song co-written with Laura Lynch called "Pink Toenails" resurfaced. The song was featured in the film, ''[[Don't Say A Word]]'', with [[Skye McCole Bartusiak]] performing the song.<ref name="Yahoo review">(Retrieved March 22, 2008)[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1807438736/cast#Music Yahoo Movie Review for Don't Say a Word] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522135843/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1807438736/cast#Music |date=May 22, 2011 }}</ref>

When their second album had a more polished sound, Maguire commented, "I hope our fans won't be disappointed [in ''The Little Ol' Cowgirl'']; it's got drums on every track; it's no longer bluegrass, but we have to make a living and you can't do that playing bluegrass."<ref name="Clark">Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time?

Two albums later, after [[Natalie Maines]] became the lead vocalist of the Chicks, the band's commercial success skyrocketed. Maguire said of their music, "It's very rootsy, but then Natalie comes in with a rock and blues influence. That gave Emily and I{{sic}} a chance to branch out, because we loved those kinds of music but felt limited by our instruments."<ref name="Malkin">{{cite web|url=http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html |title=Martie Maguire |publisher=Chickoholic.tripod.com |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref>

[[File:Martie Maguire in Austin, Texas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Martie Maguire with the Dixie Chicks in Austin, TX, 2006]]
Maguire co-wrote the song, "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]" on the Chicks' album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' for her sister Emily. It was a tribute to Emily's [[courtship]] with [[country music]] writer/singer [[Charlie Robison]].<ref name="Ladies Home Journal" /> Maguire was singled out by [[Broadcast Music, Incorporated|BMI]] in 2000, and awarded Songwriter of the Year for writing and/or co-writing "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]", "Ready To Run" and "[[You Were Mine]]". "You Were Mine" was co-written by the sisters about their parents' divorce.<ref name="Hillman">Hillman, Chris [https://ew.com/article/1999/09/23/dixie-chicks-burn-billboard-pop-charts/ Entertainment Weekly]   (Retrieved April 21, 2008)</ref>

In 1999, the Dixie Chicks performed two songs, recording a [[Cover song|cover]] of the song, "[[You Can't Hurry Love]]" as well as Maguire's "[[Ready to Run (Dixie Chicks song)|Ready to Run]]" for the [[Julia Roberts]]/ [[Richard Gere]] film ''[[Runaway Bride (1999 film)|Runaway Bride]]''. In 2003, Maguire was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for co-composing the [[film score]] to ''[[Urban Cowboy (musical)|Urban Cowboy]]''; the musical used her "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]".<ref name="Frontpage Publicity">[http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/careeroverview.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226165207/http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/careeroverview.html|date=February 26, 2008}}</ref>

After the band achieved massive commercial success with its first two [[Sony Music|Sony]] studio albums with Maines, they struggled with their record company over artistic direction on the third. Maguire commented, "I don't think any of us ever trusted Nashville. When you're in that town you know everybody is talking about everybody else. Everybody is wishing for the other guy to fail."<ref name="Flippo">Martie Maguire, to ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 5/21/06.

Although Maguire and Strayer often appear quiet and demure compared to their animated bandmate Natalie Maines, the trio have stood united on controversial subjects since they banded together to play in 1995, even when their opinions have had the potential to serve them more harm than good. In 2006, Maguire said, "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Toby Keith]]. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |title=Chicks in the Line of Fire |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1196419,00.html |magazine=Time |date=May 21, 2006 |publisher=Time Magazine |access-date=October 5, 2022}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Maguire married [[pharmaceutical]] [[sales representative|representative]] Ted Seidel on June 17, 1995, and changed her last name to Seidel. She also was stepmother to his son, Carter. However, her marriage did not last, and she and Ted Seidel were divorced in November 1999.<ref name="Ladies Home Journal"/>

At bandmate [[Natalie Maines]]' sister Kim's wedding, Martie met Gareth Maguire, a [[Roman Catholic]] teacher and actor from [[Carnlough]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The couple became engaged in June 2001 and married on August 10, 2001, in a civil ceremony in Hawaii; as explained at one of their concerts, the Dixie Chicks' song "[[White Trash Wedding]]" is based on Martie's relationship with Gareth.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/EshGQDYBKyE Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150110122700/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EshGQDYBKyE Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EshGQDYBKyE |title=An evening with The Dixie Chicks - White Trash Wedding |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-11-25 |access-date=2014-07-15}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Later they had a Catholic "blessing" ceremony in the groom's hometown, [[Carnlough]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]], on March 9, 2002, for all the guests that were not able to attend the first wedding.

Maguire has been frank about using [[in vitro fertilization]] to conceive their daughters. In an interview in ''[[Conceive (magazine)|Conceive]]'', she said, "All my paperwork said 'unspecified origin.'  We spent three years of active trying before we went to IVF. First I went on [[Clomid]]. Then I had some dye tests and found I had a collapsed tube, so I had [[laparoscopic surgery]]; the tube wasn't blocked, just spasming." After three attempts at [[intrauterine insemination]], she said, she and her husband didn't think it was worth continuing in that manner, and switched to [[IVF]].<ref name="common1">{{cite web|url=http://www.conceiveonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=71&Itemid=22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206171500/http://www.conceiveonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=71&Itemid=22 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 6, 2009 |title=The Dixie Chicks: Taking the Long Way ... to Motherhood |last=Weinhouse |first=Beth |date=Fall 2007 |publisher=Conceive Magazine Online |access-date=2008-07-27 }}</ref> In August 2007, Maguire began IVF again, resulting in their third daughter Harper. In 2008, regarding the number of children the Dixie Chicks had produced in the past seven years, (Maines had two; Strayer had four in addition to Maguire's twins and newborn) Maguire told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' "We'll have to move over and let the little chicks take over! We've got a new band!"<ref name="People">''People Magazine'' (accessed January 28, 2008) [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20174066,00.html  Dixie Chick Martie Maguire Is Expecting]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914183801/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20174066%2C00.html |date=September 14, 2016 }}</ref>

Maguire and Strayer co-wrote a song, "So Hard", about their own personal experiences with infertility and their need to rely on other methods to conceive. They speak out about the difficulties they faced, but also their good fortune; both having options that for many women are financially prohibitive. Mentioning the [[social stigma|stigma]] attached to IVF, Maguire said, "I think we feel a responsibility to break down some barriers. It's much more of a common problem than people realize."<ref name="FrontpagePublicity">Frontpage Publicity [http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/bio.html  Dixie Chicks Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017015925/http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/bio.html |date=October 17, 2015 }}</ref> A final concern Maguire mentioned was the question of what to do with all the unused frozen [[embryos]].<blockquote>Now that I have children, I see those embryos as possible children. So I have to think about what my options are if there are leftovers again. I could keep them in storage, and maybe they will help my children some day. Or I can try to donate them to [[stem cell research]]. I don't think I could give them to another family. I would always worry: what if it's an abusive family? What if they don't get enough love?<ref name="common1"/>{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</blockquote>

'''Micky & the Motorcars''' is a [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] band formed in [[Stanley, Idaho]], now based in [[Austin, Texas]]. They have released nine albums, including two live albums.

==Background==
[[File:Micky and the Motorcars blacksheep 2017 7872.jpg|thumb|Micky Braun 2017]]

The two founding members, Micky and Gary Braun, are the sons of [[outlaw country]] and western swing musician Muzzie Braun of [[Stanley, Idaho]], and the brothers of Cody Braun and Willy Braun of the [[Texas]]-based [[roots rock]] band [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly]]. Both were part of Muzzie Braun & the Little Braun Brothers band, but formed their own band after Cody and Willy left to form Reckless Kelly.<ref name="allmusic bio">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/micky-the-motorcars-mn0000123988/biography |title=Micky & the Motorcars |first= Steve|last= Leggett |work=AllMusic}}</ref> 

The band originated in Idaho. The other founding members were childhood friends Travis Hardy on [[Drum|drums]] and Mark McCoy on [[Bass guitar|bass]]. They moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas, where Joseph Deeb joined the band as their lead guitarist.<ref name="allmusic bio" /> The band has undergone a number of personnel changes since its founding. Mark McCoy left the band in 2011 and died in 2012 in a rafting accident.<ref name="the boot">{{cite web |url=https://theboot.com/micky-and-the-motorcars-hold-this-town-together/ |title=Micky and the Motorcars, 'Hold This Town Together' |work=The Boot|date= October 7, 2019 |first= Angela |last=Stefano}}</ref> 

The band currently consists of Micky Braun ([[acoustic guitar]], [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]]), Gary Braun (lead & [[harmony vocals]], guitars, [[mandolin]], [[harmonica]]), Pablo Trujillo ([[lead guitar]], [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]]), Andrew Carrell (bass), and Bobby Paugh (drums & percussion).

The band is also tied to the Texas music movement and, to a lesser extent, the [[Oklahoma]]-based Red Dirt music scene. Every year, the band, in conjunction with their brothers and fellow musicians in Reckless Kelly, host the Braun Brothers Reunion in Idaho to celebrate the music and different artists from the genre.

'''Mike McClure''' (born July 6, 1971) is an American singer, songwriter, and producer from [[Tecumseh, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mike McClure Myspace Blog|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=39123011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306074423/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=39123011|archivedate=2010-03-06}}</ref> He is currently the frontman for the Mike McClure Band. McClure is a founding member of [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]], and was a member until he and the band parted ways in 2002. The Mike McClure Band consists of McClure (guitar, vocals), and Caleb Shirtum (bass).<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike McClure Band|url=http://www.myspace.com/mikemcclureband}}</ref>

McClure got his start in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], and would hang out and play music at the notorious "Farm" with other [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] artists such as [[Bob Childers]], Tom Skinner, and Scott Evans. After forming The Great Divide with J.J. Lester, Scotte Lester, and Kelley Green in 1992 and contributing to six studio albums and one live two-part album, McClure set out to do his own thing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike McClure: The Red Dirt Rockstar|url=http://www.texasmusictimes.com/articles/0609/0609-Stricklan-McClure.php}}</ref>

In 2002, while still a member of The Great Divide, he released [[Twelve Pieces]], his first solo album. First there was Les Paul Clanton on bass and Rodney Pyeatt on guitar. Both went to do other projects. After recruiting Tom Skinner (bass) and Eric Hansen (drums), McClure had his band together. In 2004, The Mike McClure Band released their first album [[Everything Upside Down]], a hard-hitting rock album. McClure often uses the quote that his new band is "twice as loud, and half as popular."<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike McClure rocks the Iron Horse with Red Dirt music|url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2008/jun/21/mike-mcclure-rocks-iron-horse-red-dirt-music/}}</ref> Since the first album, the band has put out seven more albums, including the 2004 collaboration with the Burtschi Brothers of [[Norman, Oklahoma]].  After the death of Tom Skinner in July 2015 and the departure of Hansen, the band took on its current look.

As a songwriter and producer, McClure has collaborated with many other Red Dirt artists. He has become the permanent producer for [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]]. Usually contributing also as a songwriter, he has produced five of their seven studio albums, jokingly earning him the title of "prodouchebag."<ref>{{cite news|title=prodouchebag hits billboard|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=39123011&blogId=510193607|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view|archivedate=2009-02-07}}</ref> McClure has also produced albums by other artists around the scene such as [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Jason Boland & the Stragglers]], [[Scott Copeland]], Johnny Cooper, [[Whiskey Myers]], and the [[Turnpike Troubadours]].

In 2011 McClure Produced and Recorded with  [http://www.damnquails.com The Damn Quails], releasing "Down the Hatch"  in October 2011.

In 2014, McClure produced and recorded [http://www.chrisbrazealband.com The Chris Brazeal Band], releasing their 3rd album "A Heart Like Yours" in September 2014. He appears on their cover of Hal Ketchum's "Small Town Saturday Night"

==Early life==
Miranda Leigh Lambert was born November 10, 1983,<ref name="dob"/> to Rick and Bev (née Hughes) Lambert in [[Longview, Texas]],<ref name="Miranda Lambert Biography"/> and was raised in [[Lindale, Texas]]. She was named after her great-grandmother, Lucy Miranda.<ref name="usmagazine.com">''Us Weekly'', March 30, 2011, "[http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-miranda-lambert-2011303 25 Things You Don't Know About Me: Miranda Lambert] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052934/http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-miranda-lambert-2011303 |date=June 5, 2014 }}". Accessed June 1, 2014.</ref> She has one younger brother.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carey |first=Stacy |url=https://www.axs.com/miranda-lambert-s-look-alike-brother-luke-joins-sis-for-fun-evening-ou-20133 |title=Miranda Lambert's look-alike brother: Luke joins sis for evening out |date=June 23, 2014 |access-date=April 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402163323/https://www.axs.com/miranda-lambert-s-look-alike-brother-luke-joins-sis-for-fun-evening-ou-20133 |archive-date=April 2, 2018 }}</ref>

Her parents met while Bev was attending camp at [[Southern Methodist University]] and Rick was an on-campus undercover narcotics officer, and they got together a few years later. Rick is a former [[Dallas]] police officer who played in a country-rock group called Contraband in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/14/singles-going-steady-2|title=Singles Going Steady|date=November 14, 2005|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=April 5, 2016|archive-date=August 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810092724/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/14/singles-going-steady-2|url-status=live}}</ref> Rick and Bev later became [[Private investigator|private detectives]] and even worked on the high-profile case of the impeachment of President [[Bill Clinton]]. After the oil crisis dampened the economy in Texas, her family lost everything.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/amp43217/miranda-lambert-parents-private-detectives/ |title= Miranda Lambert's Parents Were Private Detectives in the Clinton Impeachment Investigation |date= May 23, 2017 |access-date= April 2, 2018 |archive-date= April 2, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180402163534/https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/amp43217/miranda-lambert-parents-private-detectives/ |url-status= live }}</ref>

At 16, Lambert appeared on the Johnnie High Country Music Revue in [[Arlington, Texas]], the same talent show that had helped launch the career of [[LeAnn Rimes]]. Lambert then acquired a recording session in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], but left the studio after she became frustrated with the "pop" type of music presented to her. She went back to Texas in 2000 and asked her father to teach her how to play guitar, so she could write her own songs.<ref name=wrangler>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/14/AR2007051401683_2.html Texas Wrangler, Page 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714042708/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/14/AR2007051401683_2.html |date=July 14, 2017 }}, Washington Post May 15, 2007.

It would contain 15 songs the three singer-songwriters had written together over a period of six years, beginning in July 2015.

''In His Arms'' was performed live by Lambert, Randall and Ingram at the 2021 [[Academy of Country Music Awards|ACM Awards]], and at the awards show Lambert also performed "[[Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home)]]" with [[Elle King]], and she also stood in last-minute for [[Chris Stapleton]]'s wife [[Morgane Stapleton]] to sing harmony on Stapleton's performance of ''Maggie's Song.''

==Early life==
Born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], Case is the only child of James Bamford Case<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ferndalerecord.com/m-lucille-case/|title=M. Lucille Case &#124; Ferndale Record|website=Ferndalerecord.com}}</ref> and Diana Mary Dubbs.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} Case's paternal family surname was originally [[Shevchenko]]; her great-aunt was the professional wrestler [[Ella Waldek]].<ref name=EW-Amazing>{{cite magazine|last=Berick|first=Michael|title=Department of Amazing Coincidences: Neko's Gripping Tale|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 7, 2005|issue=806|url=https://ew.com/article/2005/02/07/neko-cases-amazing-coincidence/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426002142/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1024590,00.html |access-date=November 7, 2013|url-status=live|archive-date=April 26, 2009 }}</ref> Her father, a [[Vietnam]] veteran serving in the [[United States Air Force]],<ref name=Furious-Thrice>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever|access-date=November 7, 2013|format=Online music magazine}}</ref> was based in Virginia at the time of her birth. Case's parents, who were teenagers when they had her, are of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ancestry.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> Her parents divorced when Case began school.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline />

Case's family relocated several times during her childhood due to her stepfather's work as an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. She has lived in Western Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon and Washington.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> She considers [[Tacoma, Washington]] to be her hometown.

Case left home at age 15. By the age of 18 she was performing as a drummer for the Del Logs and the Propanes, playing in venues including a punk club called the Community World Theater.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline />

==Music career==
===Vancouver===
In 1994, Case moved to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, to attend the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]]. While attending, she played drums in several local bands, including the Del Logs, the Propanes, the Weasels, [[Cub (band)|Cub]], and [[Maow]]. These bands  were, for the most part, local [[Punk rock|punk]] groups. Case said of the vibrant Vancouver punk rock scene at that time, "A lot of women wanted to play music because they were inspired, because it was an incredibly good time for music in the Northwest. There was a lot of clubs, a lot of bands, a lot of people coming through, a lot of all-ages stuff—it was a very exciting time to live there."<ref name=Furious-Thrice />

In 1998, Case left without finishing her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, which meant the loss of her student [[visa (document)|visa]] eligibility.<ref>Francois Marchand, [https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/music/the-miseducation-of-neko-case "The miseducation of Neko Case"], ''The Vancouver Sun'', April 8, 2015. Retrieved July 27, 2018.</ref> She left Canada for [[Seattle]], Washington. Before going, Case recorded vocals for a few songs that ended up on ''[[Mass Romantic]]'', [[the New Pornographers]]' first album. Her lead vocals on songs like "Letter from an Occupant" are straightforward, full-volume [[power-pop]] performances,  shedding any country elements. Released on November 28, 2000, ''Mass Romantic'' became a surprise success.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=February 05 |last2=Arts |first2=2011 {{!}} Brian C. {{!}} |last3=culture |last4=Feminism |last5=Media |title=Support Women Artists Sunday: Neko Case - Women's Media Center |url=https://womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/support-women-artists-sunday-neko-case |access-date=2023-10-09 |website=Womensmediacenter.com |language=en}}</ref> Although the band was originally conceived as a side project for its members, the New Pornographers remain a prominent presence in the indie rock world, having released its ninth album in 2023.

In addition to recording with the New Pornographers, Case frequently collaborates with other Canadian musicians, including [[the Sadies]] and [[Carolyn Mark]], and has recorded material by several noted Canadian songwriters, in particular on her 2001 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Canadian Amp]]''. As a result, she is also considered a significant figure in Canadian music—both [[CBC Radio 3]] and the [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]] have referred to Case as an "honourary Canadian".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/news_events/feature_stories/Neko.jsp |title=Neko Case: Honourary Canadian, Proud SOCAN Member |author=Jim Kelly |date=2003-01-19 |access-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030119234628/http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/news_events/feature_stories/Neko.jsp |archive-date=January 19, 2003 }}</ref> In 2018 Case performed at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.<ref>[https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ "41st Vancouver Folk Music Festival still true to tradition, still young at heart"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713225922/https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ |date=July 13, 2019 }}.

Case embraced country music on her 1997 album, ''[[The Virginian (album)|The Virginian]]''. The album contained original compositions as well as covers of songs by [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Loretta Lynn]] and the 1974 [[Queen (band)|Queen]] song "[[Misfire (song)|Misfire]]".<ref name="Peppiatt2004">{{cite book|author=Francesca Peppiatt|title=Country Music's Most WantedTM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huXRARoi8vcC&pg=PT190|date=19 February 2004|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61234-241-2|pages=190–}}</ref> When the album was released, critics compared Case to [[honky tonk|honky-tonk]] singers like Lynn and [[Patsy Cline]], and to [[rockabilly]] pioneer [[Wanda Jackson]], particularly in her vocal timbre.<ref>{{cite news|first=Grant|last=Britt|url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-and-record-grant-britt-neko-case/130981137/|title=Neko Case performance is a chance to live in the moment|newspaper=News and Record (Greensboro, North Carolina)|date= January 18, 2018|page=13-Go Triad|access-date=August 31, 2023|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

On February 22, 2000, Case released her second solo album, ''[[Furnace Room Lullaby]]''. The album introduced the "country noir" elements that have defined Case's subsequent solo career. That tone was evident even from the cover photo, featuring Case sprawled out corpse-like on a concrete floor. On the album itself, her vocal style moves away from outright honky-tonk but retains her twang, garnering comparisons to musicians such as Cline, Lynn, [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Tanya Tucker]], and [[Dolly Parton]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The title track was included on the soundtrack to [[Sam Raimi]]'s film ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and "Porchlight" was featured on the soundtrack to ''[[The Slaughter Rule]]''.

Case sometimes tours with Canadian singer and songwriter Carolyn Mark as [[the Corn Sisters]].<ref name=holliston>Tom Holliston, [http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/The-Corn-Sisters "The Corn Sisters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=March 1, 2016 }}.

===Chicago===
In October 1999, around the time ''Furnace Room Lullaby'' was released, Case left Seattle<ref name=Furious-Thrice /> for Chicago because she felt that Seattle was no longer hospitable to its local artists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scanlon |first=Tom |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000615&slug=4026820 |title=Living &#124; Country singer Neko Case is movin' on &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2000-06-15 |access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref>

Case's first work in Chicago was an eight-song [[Extended play|EP]] that she recorded in her kitchen. ''[[Canadian Amp]]'', her first recording without Her Boyfriends, was released on her own Lady Pilot label in 2001. She wrote two of the tracks, with the remaining six being covers, including [[Neil Young]]'s "Dreaming Man" and Hank Williams' "Alone and Forsaken". Four of the covers were written by Canadian artists. The EP was initially available only at Case's live shows and directly from Mint Records' website, but it eventually saw wider release.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78018/canadian-amp|title=Canadian Amp|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref>

Case also recorded her third full-length album, ''[[Blacklisted (Neko Case album)|Blacklisted]]'', while living in Chicago.

In April 2003, Case was voted the "Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock" in a Playboy.com internet poll, receiving 32% of the vote. ''[[Playboy]]'' asked her to pose nude for the magazine, but she declined their offer. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that

<blockquote>I didn't want to be the girl who posed in ''Playboy'' and then—by the way—made some music. I would be really fucking irritated if after a show somebody came up to me and handed me some naked picture of myself and wanted me to sign it instead of my CD.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Valby |first=Karen |url=https://ew.com/article/2003/06/06/lovably-foulmouthed-neko-case-sounds/ |title=Gloves Off |magazine=EW.com |date=2003-06-06 |access-date=2014-08-11 |archive-date=May 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504113344/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,455377,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

In later interviews, she declined to discuss the survey at all.

===Neko Case & Her Boyfriends===
Case recorded and toured for several years as '''Neko Case & Her Boyfriends''' before performing solely under her name. She primarily performed her own material, but also performed and recorded [[cover version]]s of songs by artists such as [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] and [[Hank Williams]].  
Albums released included ''[[The Virginian (album)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[Furnace Room Lullaby]]''.

===New Pornographers===
[[The New Pornographers]]' second album, ''[[Electric Version]]'', was released on May 6, 2003. Case sang lead on even more of the songs on this album, and toured with the group again.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''[[Twin Cinema]]'', the New Pornographers' third album, was released on August 23, 2005, with Case again providing vocals on several tracks. In addition to providing backing vocals on several songs, Case performs lead vocals on two ballads, "The Bones of an Idol" and "These Are the Fables". She opted out of most subsequent touring duties with the band; however, her parts were taken over by [[Kathryn Calder]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On ''[[Challengers (album)|Challengers]]'', released on August 21, 2007, Case contributes lead vocals to the title song as well as "Go Places", in addition to her backing vocals on the other tracks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The 2010 album ''[[Together (New Pornographers album)|Together]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Crash Years" and "My Shepherd."<ref>{{cite web|title=Together Credits|url=http://allmusic.com/album/together-r1743496/credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

The 2014 album ''[[Brill Bruisers]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Champions of Red Wine" and "Marching Orders."

====''Blacklisted''====
Case recorded her third full-length album, ''[[Blacklisted (Neko Case album)|Blacklisted]]'', in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. It was the first full-length album credited to Case alone, without Her Boyfriends, and was released on [[Bloodshot Records]] on August 20, 2002. Some believe the title ''Blacklisted'' alludes to Case being banned for life from the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' because she took her shirt off during a performance on August 4, 2001, at one of their outdoors "Opry Plaza" concerts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/neko-case/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223144357/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/neko-case/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2011|title=Neko Case - Biography|publisher=rollingstone.com|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=guardian13Mar2009>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Leonie|title=The banned played on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/13/neko-case-middle-cyclone-interview|access-date=February 2, 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 13, 2009}}</ref> though Case herself has denied this.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nekocase/articles/story/5934106/neko_cases_country_lust |title=Neko Case's Country Lust: Neko Case : Rolling Stone |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2002-10-15 |access-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505015825/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nekocase/articles/story/5934106/neko_cases_country_lust |archive-date=May 5, 2009 }}</ref> Asked about the incident in 2004, Case said "I had [[heatstroke]].

[[File:Neko Case at All Points West (edit).jpg|alt=Case's face|thumb|Case in 2009]]

Most of the album's fourteen songs are originals; the exceptions being covers of "Running Out of Fools", previously a hit for [[Aretha Franklin]], and "Look for Me (I'll Be Around)" previously performed by [[Sarah Vaughan]]. ''Blacklisted'' finds Case even deeper in a "country noir" mood, and was described by critics as lush, bleak, and atmospheric. Case cited filmmaker [[David Lynch]], composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], and Neil Young's soundtrack to the film ''[[Dead Man]]'' as influences.<ref name=nekocaseinterview>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American| url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever | date= October 14, 2002 |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref>

These shows were recorded and released as a live album, ''[[The Tigers Have Spoken]]'', by Anti Records in October 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicholasjennings.com/2004/neko-case |title=Neko Case |publisher=Nicholasjennings.com |date=August 17, 2009 |access-date=2013-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922090920/http://www.nicholasjennings.com/2004/neko-case |archive-date=September 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

====''Fox Confessor Brings the Flood''====
''[[Fox Confessor Brings the Flood]]'' was released on March 7, 2006. The album was recorded primarily in Tucson, over the course of two years as Case worked on the live ''The Tigers Have Spoken'' and continued to play with the New Pornographers. Critics hailed the record not only for Case's trademark vocals but also her use of stark imagery and non-standard song structures. ''Fox Confessor Brings the Flood'' wound up on many "Best of 2006" lists, such as No.1 on the Amazon.com music editors' picks and No.&nbsp;2 on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Songs Considered]]''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;54 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. It contains Case's most autobiographical song, "Hold On, Hold On". Case said: "the song is actually about me. It's not metaphorical about other people. It's not little pieces of my life made into a story about someone else or someone fictitious."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan |first=Kyle |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/neko-case,13986/ |title=Neko Case &#124; Interview |newspaper=The A.V.

'''Kearney Nick Jones''', better known by his stage name '''Nick 13''', is the lead vocalist, guitarist and main songwriter of [[psychobilly]] band [[Tiger Army]], as well as a solo artist in the [[alternative country]] genre.

==Career==

===Tiger Army===
{{main|Tiger Army}}
Tiger Army was signed to [[Hellcat Records]] in 1996 shortly after forming and released their [[Tiger Army (album)|self-titled]] full-length debut album in October 1999. That album was followed by 2001's ''[[Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite]]'', 2004's ''[[Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise]]'' and 2007's ''[[Music from Regions Beyond]]'' before leaving the label. Their latest album, ''[[V •••–]]'', was released in 2016 on [[Luna Tone Records]]/[[Rise Records]].

===Solo career===
In an interview, Nick 13 was asked why the sole songwriter for a band would launch a solo career.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/qa_nick_13_on_tiger_armys_14th_anniversary/|title=Nick 13 On Tiger Army's 14th Anniversary |date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010 | work=Alternative Press}}</ref> "The first person to give me the idea of a primary songwriter making a solo record was Paul Fenech of [[The Meteors]]," he said. "I always thought there was something cool about that: You write all the songs for the band, and there's a certain sound people expect. But while Tiger Army has always tested those kinds of boundaries, there are certain things that relate to heaviness and aggression that aren't part of my solo project, at all." When asked about the status of Tiger Army, he said, "Tiger Army aren't going anywhere—we will be back." 

His first full performance as a solo artist was at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] in Indio, California, in spring, 2010, where he opened for [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]. A handful of small club dates in California followed, leading up to an appearance at the Hootenanny Festival in Orange County just before [[Chuck Berry]]. Press reviews for both festival events were favorable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.inlandsocal.com/music/2010/04/stagecoach-nick-13-trades-punk.html|title=Stagecoach Nick 13 Trades Punk for Country|date=April 24, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010|work=The Press Enterprise|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713035137/http://blogs.inlandsocal.com/music/2010/04/stagecoach-nick-13-trades-punk.html|archivedate=July 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/rock-80491-ocprint-berry-material.html|title=Hootenanny Still Strong |date=July 5, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010 | work=OC Register}}</ref>

The project doubles as the group's first release for the Columbia label, which also released ''Blonde on Blonde''. They announced their addition to the roster with an impromptu performance of "[[Rainy Day Women ♯12 & 35|Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]" from the Dylan album. In support of the album release, Secor states:

<blockquote>Fifty years is a long time for a place like Nashville, Tennessee. Time rolls on slowly around here like flotsam and jetsam in the muddy [[Cumberland River]].

=== ''Volunteer'' (2018) ===
Old Crow Medicine Show released their sixth studio album, ''Volunteer'', through Columbia Nashville on April 20, 2018—coinciding with their 20th anniversary as a group. The album was recorded at Nashville's "historic" RCA Studio A with Americana "super-producer" [[Dave Cobb]], known for his work with [[Jason Isbell]] and [[Chris Stapleton]].

"Look Away" is a "Rolling Stones-inspired tribute to the history of the American South," while "A World Away" is an "upbeat homage to refugees." "Dixie Avenue" is a wistful tribute to the place in Virginia where Secor and Fuqua first "fell in love with music." The closing song "Whirlwind" is a "bittersweet love song that could easily describe Old Crow Medicine's rise to prominence from the ground up."<ref name=":3" />

The lead single "Flicker & Shine" was released January 19, 2018.<ref name=":3" />

The band released their seventh studio album, ''[[Paint This Town]]'' on April 22, 2022.

===Influences===

An early Secor influence was [[John Hartford]] who performed for his first grade class in [[Missouri]], making him want "to play the banjo after that;"<ref name=Premo group=i>{{cite news|last=Premo|first=Cole|title=Curiocity Interview: Ketch Secor Of 'Old Crow Medicine Show'|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/curiocity-interview-ketch-secor-of-old-crow-medicine-show/|access-date=13 November 2012|newspaper=CBS Minnesota|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> and the first song he ever learned to play was [[Tom Paxton]]'s "[[Ramblin' Boy]]".<ref name=Goodman />{{rp|6}} [[Guns N' Roses]] was Fuqua's "first influence": when they released ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), while he was in seventh grade, he knew he wanted to be a musician.

Naming his major influences, Secor states: "Certainly, Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan. More than anything else. More than any book or song or story or play. The work and the recorded work of Bob Dylan. It's the most profound influence on me. And then the other people that really influenced me, tend to be the same people who influenced Bob Dylan."<ref name=Premo group=i/> Fuqua concurs on Dylan's influence:

{{blockquote|He's a link to Woody Guthrie, who's a link to an even earlier form of American music history. He's... a great doorway for all sorts of artists because he's not just folk or just rock ... I think bands like us, Mumford and Sons, and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are sort of doing what he has done before, in that we take our own experiences and observations and put them into songs made of traditional, American roots form. That form is still a great vehicle for songs, whether the song is about love, the Iraq War or anything else.<ref name=Dearmore group=i/>}}

The Dylan doorway led to the first recordings of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], the [[Jim Kweskin|Jim Kweskin Jug Band]], [[Canned Heat]], [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], Dylan and [[The Band]] in the basement, and the [[Grateful Dead]].<ref name=Mazor2004 />

|quote=It takes a lot to figure out how to keep one foot in old-time and one foot in all time. It's a bit of a dance to be rooted and modern at the same time.

Early on the group didn't perform songs they'd written, instead drawing on a storehouse of pre-war [[jug band]], string band, [[minstrel show]], blues, and folk fare. As with other young groups in the genre, driven by all that punk music energy, they played this old material "fast and hard".<ref name=Himes>{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|title=That Old-Time Feeling: The new wave of string bands evolves|url=http://citypaper.com/music/that-old-time-feeling-1.1371425|access-date=13 September 2012|newspaper=Baltimore City Paper|date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> When they started writing original material they distinguished themselves "from the crowded field of New Wave string bands as genuine stars. And both groups have done it by writing new songs more ambitious than mere rewrites of old [[Hillbilly music|hillbilly]] and blues numbers."<ref name=Himes /> Songs they write often have a socially conscious theme, such as  "I Hear Them All", "Ways Of Man", "Ain't It Enough", and "Levi".

Secor admits to developing "the habit of writing what he calls 'stolen melody songs'"—in much the same way he'd created "Wagon Wheel", carrying on in the folk tradition—"like when he penned fresh, war tax-themed lyrics to a tune that had already passed through other wholesale re-writes during its descent from old-time [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[balladry]]."<ref name="Hight" /> Dave Rawlings states: "I've always thought that a really important thing that the Old Crow Medicine Show brought to the table was new songs—some reinterpreted old ones, some really nicely written and brand new—with the old flavor, but also with that vitality."<ref name=Mazor>{{cite news|last=Mazor|first=Barry|title=Renegades on the Road|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574320383262997704 |access-date=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>

| quote = My relationship with the band is a bit like a Saturn 5 rocket.  For whatever reason, I need to leave sometimes. I achieve an escape vector from the gravitational pull of Old Crow, then I’m off into space, orbiting, floating in zero gravity in my capsule.

== Early life ==
Fulks was born in [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pennsylvania]], the son of a school teacher father. He grew up in small towns in southeastern [[Pennsylvania]], the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] area of [[Virginia]], and the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region of [[North Carolina]]. Fulks's family moved often when he was young, eventually settling in North Carolina when he was 12, and Fulks considers North Carolina his childhood home.<ref name=Outlaw-GoneAwayBackward-2012>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Shannon|title=A Chat with Robbie Fulks: Country's Kingpin of Clever|url=http://www.outlawmagazine.com/2012/06/24/a-chat-with-robbie-fulks-countrys-kingpin-of-clever/|work=Outlaw Magazine|date=24 June 2012|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220131127/http://www.outlawmagazine.com/2012/06/24/a-chat-with-robbie-fulks-countrys-kingpin-of-clever/|url-status=live}}</ref> He has a younger brother named Jubal.<ref name=CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001 />

Fulks was exposed to music through his family in which everyone played a different musical instrument, from his Aunt Stella on banjo, his Aunt Mildred on violin and his mother on autoharp, to his father playing guitar.<ref name=CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001 /><ref name=Outlaw-GoneAwayBackward-2012 /><ref name=ChiTonight-2014>{{cite web|title=Robbie Fulks|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2014/01/09/robbie-fulks|work=WTTW Chicago Tonight|format=TV interview|date=9 January 2014|access-date=10 January 2014|archive-date=10 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110214253/http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2014/01/09/robbie-fulks|url-status=live}}</ref>  Fulks picked up his aunt's banjo when he was six and started playing guitar at age 11.<ref name=CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001 /><ref name=IndyWeek-UplandStories-2016>{{cite news|last1=Schram|first1=Dan|title=Video: Robbie Fulks Returns to Durham with New Autobiographical Songs|url=http://www.indyweek.com/music/archives/2016/06/23/video-robbie-fulks-returns-to-durham-with-autobiographical-new-songs|work=[[Indy Week]]|date=23 June 2016|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220113134/http://www.indyweek.com/music/archives/2016/06/23/video-robbie-fulks-returns-to-durham-with-autobiographical-new-songs|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Career ==
While at [[Columbia University]], Fulks often played at [[Gerdes Folk City]] and other places in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name=Outlaw-GoneAwayBackward-2012/> He also performed on campus in places such as the [[Postcrypt Coffeehouse]].<ref name=":0" /> He eventually dropped out of college after two years to pursue music full time.<ref name=NYT-2000 />

=== Chicago ===
Fulks moved to Chicago in 1983 and started teaching at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref name=CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001 /> In 1987, he joined [[The Special Consensus]] Bluegrass Band, where he showcased his unique guitar flatpicking style. In the early 1990s he performed in the musical ''Woody Guthrie's American Song''.<ref name=allmusic-bio>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Robbie Fulks – Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/robbie-fulks-mn0000285164/biography|work=All Music|publisher=All Media Network, LLC.|access-date=December 28, 2013|archive-date=November 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123013204/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/robbie-fulks-mn0000285164/biography|url-status=live}}</ref>

He also recorded his original compositions. Many of his early tracks were engineered by [[Steve Albini]], and the Chicago punk-country label [[Bloodshot Records]] began releasing them in 1993.<ref name=Outlaw-GoneAwayBackward-2012 /><ref name=Trib-2011-Honest /><ref name=NoDep-LindaRay1997>{{cite journal|last=Ray|first=Linda|title=The Long Way Around – Feature: Robbie Fulks|url=http://archives.nodepression.com/1997/09/it-drawled-from-the-mouth/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606041414/http://archives.nodepression.com/1997/09/it-drawled-from-the-mouth/|archive-date=June 6, 2013|journal=No Depression Magazine|access-date=December 28, 2013|issue=11|date=September–October 1997}}</ref>

=== Nashville ===
While living in Chicago, Fulks worked for four years as a country songwriter, mainly for Music Row publisher API.<ref name=CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001 /> His solo debut album, ''Country Love Songs'', engineered by [[Steve Albini]],<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> was released on Bloodshot Records in 1996 and received positive reviews. The Skeletons, members of whom later formed the band [[The Morells]], played on most of the tracks<ref name="NoDep-LindaRay1997" /> and [[Tom Brumley]] and [[Buck Owens]] also featured. ''Country Love Songs'' was followed in 1997 by ''South Mouth'', which confirmed Fulks's retro-alternative image.

Fans had grown used to his rough and sparse sound, but his third album, 1998's ''Let's Kill Saturday Night'', on [[Geffen Records]],<ref name="Soundbite-2000">{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Jesse|title=Soundbite: Music Man|url=http://reason.com/archives/2000/05/01/soundbite-music-man|work=Reason.com|publisher=Reason Foundation|access-date=December 27, 2013|date=May 2000|archive-date=November 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111103225/http://reason.com/archives/2000/05/01/soundbite-music-man|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="NYT-Dresden">{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Neil|title=A Major Merger Shakes Up the World of Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/arts/a-major-merger-shakes-up-the-world-of-rock.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|access-date=December 28, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1998|archive-date=January 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116152111/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/arts/a-major-merger-shakes-up-the-world-of-rock.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|url-status=live}}</ref> was different. Fulks recorded it during the spring of 1998 in Nashville with producer Rick Will, and the album included performances by [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Sam Bush]], [[Bill Lloyd (country musician)|Bill Lloyd]], and [[Al Anderson (NRBQ)|Al Anderson]], as well as guitarist Rob Gjersoe ([[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]]), bassist Lorne Rall, and drummer Dan Massey.<ref name="CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001" />

Geffen Records disbanded shortly after the release of the record and Fulks, finding himself without a label, started his own company, Boondoggle Records, and released an album of previously unreleased material called ''The Very Best of Robbie Fulks''. He also licenses his music for distribution by Bloodshot.<ref name="CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001" />

{{Quote box
 |quote  = I called it ''Gone Away Backward'' because it's a phrase from the Bible… I stumbled on the phrase later in the evolution of the record when I was looking around for a title. I think it's a nice piquant phrase that has three good, strong, mellifluous words in it. As far as the backwardness of the record, I think it goes backward in terms of nostalgia for the past – bittersweet nostalgia for the past – as well as the recession having knocked everything backwards for people. In that sense, it's not an album about the past, it's an album about now.

In 2001 he released ''Couples in Trouble'', a dark, brooding, and decidedly non-country album, and ''13 Hillbilly Giants'', a collection of covers of classic country numbers, both obscure and well known. Both records were released by Bloodshot Records. Also in 2001, Fulks was an inaugural member of the judging panel for the Independent Music Awards, which supported independent artists.<ref name=IMA-judges>{{cite web|title=Past Judges for the Independent Music Awards|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp|work=Independent Music Awards|access-date=December 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024722/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp|archive-date=July 13, 2011}}</ref>

Fulks did not release another album until 2005. ''Georgia Hard'' on [[Yep Roc Records]] was a return to his county roots, and was notable for its use of long-time Nashville talent such as [[Lloyd Green]], Hank Singer, [[Dennis Crouch (bassist)|Dennis Crouch]], and [[Dallas Wayne]].<ref name=Pure2005 /> He also released a novelty single called "Fountains of Wayne Hotline," in which he imagined the power pop band [[Fountains of Wayne]] having a hotline that struggling songwriters could call for help with their song structure.

In April 2007, Fulks released a 2-CD album, ''Revenge!'' (also on Yep Roc Records), which consisted mainly of live concert recordings of older songs and included some new material. One disc, labeled ''Standing'', featured a full-band sound, while the second disc, ''Sitting,'' consisted of Fulks solo with little or no musical accompaniment. ''Standing'' opens with the tongue-in-cheek studio track "We're on the Road", which describes life on tour and simulates a telephone call to Fulks from Yep Roc Records President Glenn Dicker, demanding a new record and denigrating the sales performance of the "path-breaking, not chart-breaking" album ''Georgia Hard.''

In 2009, Fulks released an alphabetically organized collection of 50 songs via his website, a compilation called ''50-Vc. Doberman.''<ref name="NYTimes-50">{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|title=Playlist: Expansive Pop, Hypnotic Jazz, Surprising Metal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/arts/music/08play.html?_r=0|access-date=December 28, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 4, 2009|archive-date=April 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413203308/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/arts/music/08play.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref> He noted that this method, and electronic-only release in general, was not typical of musicians who worked in his genre.<ref name="ChiReader-AlbiniFulks-2014" /> In 2010, Fulks released his next album, ''Happy: Robbie Fulks Plays the Music of Michael Jackson,'' on Yep Roc Records, in which he covered some of Jackson's songs as a tribute.

In 2013, Fulks released ''Gone Away Backward,'' an acoustic album recorded and mixed by [[Steve Albini]] and released on Bloodshot Records. It was his first release on that label since 2001's ''13 Hillbilly Giants.''

In 1994, he released ''[[Gringo Honeymoon]]'' followed by ''[[No. 2 Live Dinner]] in 1996''.<ref name="mcleese" />

Keen has continued to write and record music, while also maintaining a prodigious tour schedule.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news |date=June 27, 2022 |year=2022 |title=Live 75 |pages=8–9 |work=Pollstar}}</ref> His 1997 album, ''[[Picnic (album)|Picnic]]'', marked the beginning of his on-again, off-again relationship with major labels (both that album and 1998's ''[[Walking Distance (album)|Walking Distance]]'' were issued on Arista Records, and 2001's ''[[Gravitational Forces]]'', 2009's ''[[The Rose Hotel]]'' and 2011's ''Ready for Confetti'' were released on Lost Highway Records). Keen's other albums include 2003's ''[[Farm Fresh Onions]]'' (Audium/Koch Records) and 2005's ''[[What I Really Mean]]'' and 2006's ''[[Live at the Ryman]]'' (both on E1 Music).

His band includes:
*Bill Whitbeck — bass, upright bass, vocals
*Tom Van Schaik — drums, vocals
*Brian Beken — fiddle, acoustic guitar, electric guitar

In August of 2011, Keen was contacted by a member of U.S. Navy about a fan of his, Petty Officer First Class Jason Workman of Seal team 6, who had been killed on August 6, 2011, with 29 other Brave Americans in Wardak Province, Tanji Valley, Afghanistan. Keen went to the memorial service for POFC. Workman and played his signature song I’m coming home. Keen covered all of his own expenses for travel and only wanted to show a token of his gratitude to a fan who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. {{cn|date=December 2023}}

In January 2022, Keen announced that he would stop touring and performing publicly after September 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title="Time Flies" – A message from Robert Earl Keen |first=Robert Earl |last= Keen |date=January 14, 2022 |website=robertearlkeen.com |url=https://www.robertearlkeen.com/news/time-flies |access-date=March 26, 2022}}</ref> His final tour was named the "I'm Coming Home Farewell Tour" and the final leg was played September 1, 3 and 4 at [[John T.

'''David Ryan Adams''' (born November 5, 1974) is an American [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter. He has released 29 studio albums and three as a former member of [[Whiskeytown]].

In 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'', to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single "[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his label [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.

After breaking his wrist during a live performance, Ryan Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called [[Ryan Adams & the Cardinals|The Cardinals]], who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from [[Ménière's disease]], Adams disbanded The Cardinals and took a break from music.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryan-adams-announces-split-from-the-cardinals-hiatus-20090114 |title=Ryan Adams announces split from the cardinals, hiatus|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref> However, he returned to the music scene in 2010, releasing his 13th studio album, ''[[Ashes & Fire]]''. Adams continued his musical journey by releasing his 14th album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'' in 2014.

In 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swift's]] album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums. Adams later issued an apology and eventually released six  more albums between 2020 and 2022. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Jenny Lewis]], and [[Fall Out Boy]], and has collaborated with [[Counting Crows]], [[Weezer]], [[Norah Jones]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Leona Naess]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[Beth Orton]] and [[Krista Polvere]]. He has written ''[[Infinity Blues]]'', a book of poems, and ''[[Hello Sunshine (book)|Hello Sunshine]]'', a collection of poems and short stories.

==Early life==
David Ryan Adams was born on November 5, 1974, in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]].<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ryan-adams-mn0000808336/biography|title=Ryan Adams Biography |first= Mark |last=Deming|access-date= February 14, 2019|website=[[AllMusic.com]]}}</ref> He is the middle of three children with an older brother and younger sister.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bobmehr/at-home-kinda-with-ryan-adams|title=Ryan Adams Finally Finds His Way Home|first=Bob |last=Mehr|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=September 7, 2014|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> His childhood has been described as "dysfunctional". His father left when he was five at which time he, his mother and his siblings had to move in with his grandparents since they became homeless as a result of the divorce. He has said in an interview, "I became who I am now because of my grandparents"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/22/ryan-adams-things-got-broken|title=Ryan Adams: 'Things got broken and I couldn't fix them'|first=Dave |last=Simpson|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 22, 2011|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and of his grandmother  "...she was like a mother to me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/so-alive-ryan-adams-interview|title=So Alive – Ryan Adams Interview|work=Clash Magazine|date=October 10, 2014|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> His mother remarried when he was 13.

At the age of eight, Adams began writing short stories and limericks on his grandmother's typewriter. In his own words, "I started writing short stories when I was really into [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Then later, when I was a teenager, I got really hard into cult fiction: [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]]." At 14, Adams began learning to play an electric guitar his mother and stepfather had bought him and soon joined a local band named Blank Label. While they quickly disbanded, they did record a short three-track 7-inch record, in 1991.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heatley |first=Michael |author-link= Michael Heatley |title= Ryan Adams |year=2003 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London, England|isbn=0-7119-9435-8  |pages=14–15}}</ref>

Adams dropped out of [[Jacksonville High School (North Carolina)|Jacksonville High School]] in 10th grade, at the age of 16, subsequently moving into bandmate Jere McIlwean's rental house, just outside Jacksonville.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/ryan-adams/biography|title=Ryan Adams Biography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> Around this time, he played and performed with a number of local bands, most notably his and McIlwean's The Patty Duke Syndrome. After obtaining his [[General Educational Development|GED]], Adams left Jacksonville for [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], shortly followed by McIlwean. The Patty Duke Syndrome broke up in 1994<ref>{{cite book |last=Heatley |first=Michael |author-link= Michael Heatley |title= Ryan Adams |year=2003 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London, England|isbn=0-7119-9435-8  |pages=16–20}}</ref> after releasing a [[Split album|split 7-inch single]] with GlamourPuss.

== Career ==

===Whiskeytown===
{{Main|Whiskeytown}}

Following the breakup of his high school band, The Patty Duke Syndrome, Adams helped found [[Whiskeytown]] with [[Caitlin Cary]], Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, Steve Grothmann and [[Phil Wandscher]]. Whiskeytown saw Adams move to [[Alternative country|alt-country]], describing [[punk rock]] as "too hard to sing" in the title track of Whiskeytown's debut album ''[[Faithless Street]]''. Whiskeytown was heavily influenced by a number of country-rock pioneers, most notably [[Gram Parsons]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inman |first1=Davis |title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons |url=https://americansongwriter.com/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/?nab=1 |website=American Songwriter|date=May 18, 2012 }}</ref> The band quickly gained critical acclaim with the release of their second full-length album, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', their first [[Record label|major label]] release. A third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]],'' was completed in 1999, but record label problems delayed its release. It was eventually released by [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]] in 2001, at which time the band was effectively done.

===Solo career (2000–2004)===
Adams made his solo debut in 2000, with ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' (produced by [[Ethan Johns]]).<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712133705/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=112&csid2=4&fid1=26076 'Ryan Adams Grows Up']. An interview on Exclaim.ca</ref> [[Emmylou Harris]] sang backup on "Oh My Sweet Carolina."  Other backing vocals and instruments were provided by [[Gillian Welch]], [[David Rawlings]], [[Pat Sansone]], and Kim Richey as Adams embraced a style more reminiscent of folk music. It was met with considerable critical success, but sales were slow.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Greenhaus|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_ryan_adams_reflects_on_heartbreaker/|title=Interview: Ryan Adams Reflects on 'Heartbreaker'|website=Relix|date= July 6, 2016}}</ref>

Adams released ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', the follow-up to ''Heartbreaker'', in 2001. It was well received. Adams, however, initially refused to promote the record through radio station meet-and-greets and other music-industry conventions, instead opting for more recording and some live dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} A video was eventually made for the album's first single, "[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]". The music video featured Adams performing in front of the city's skyline four days before the [[September 11 attacks]]. The video was played often on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] after the attacks and became Adams's breakthrough to mainstream music consumers.

Following the success of ''Gold'', in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from releasing his choice for a follow-up album. This would be the second time, the first being with ''Gold;'' Adams had recorded "the Suicide Handbook" which was rejected on the grounds that it was "too sad". The label opted this time around to cherry pick (without Adams' involvement) from four of Adams' recorded albums it had already dismissed as unreleasable (48 Hours, The Suicide Handbook, The Pinkhearts and The Swedish Sessions) to create ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]],'' released in September 2002. Although the album garnered him more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as ''Gold''. The same year, Adams produced [[Jesse Malin]]'s first album, ''[[The Fine Art of Self Destruction]]'', and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group [[The Finger (band)|The Finger]] (under the pseudonyms, "Warren Peace" and "Irving Plaza" respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'', released on [[One Little Indian Records]] in 2003. He also starred in a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams's "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]".

In May 2002, Adams joined Elton John on ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202201350/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 2, 2004 | title=CMT Crossroads: Elton John and Ryan Adams | access-date=April 11, 2007 | publisher = [[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> which brings together country artists with musicians from other genres. During the show, John referred to Adams as "fabulous one" and spoke of how ''Heartbreaker'' inspired him to record ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]'', which at the time was his most successful album in several years. Also in 2002, Adams reportedly recorded a cover of [[The Strokes]]' debut album ''[[Is This It]]'', though it has never been publicly released.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/11149 | title=Adams Different Strokes in Demand! | access-date=April 11, 2007 | date=April 3, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>

In 2002 and 2003, Adams worked on recording ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', intending to release it in 2003. [[Lost Highway Records]] deemed that it was not commercially viable and was reluctant to release it, leading Adams to go back to the studio. Two weeks later he returned to Lost Highway with ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock n Roll]]'', which featured guest musicians including [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], [[Green Day]]'s [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], and Adams's girlfriend at the time, [[Parker Posey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=RJ |title=Ryan Adams, 'Rock N Roll' (Lost Highway) |url=https://www.spin.com/2003/11/ryan-adams-rock-n-roll-lost-highway/ |website=SPIN |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref>  Adams' songwriting received additional exposure when [[Joan Baez]] included his song "In My Time of Need", from his debut release, on her 2003 album ''[[Dark Chords on a Big Guitar]].''

Also released in 2003, Adams formed a punk band called The Finger with [[Jesse Malin]], Colin Burns, and Johnny T. Yerington.<sup>[[The Finger (band)#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] rock band Finger, of which Adams was a big fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists to return to their punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk band [[Heart Attack (band)|Heart Attack]] and more famously as the lead singer of [[D Generation]]). They began by releasing two EPs: ''We Are Fuck You'' and ''Punk's Dead Let's Fuck'' which were later collected to form the album ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'' that was released in 2003.

Adams and Lost Highway Records eventually agreed that the label would release ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' as well as ''Love Is Hell'', on the condition that ''Love Is Hell'' be split into two EP installments. ''Rock N Roll'' and ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 1'' were released in November 2003, followed by ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 2'' in December. Both albums were well received by critics, and in May 2004 ''Love Is Hell'' was re-released as a full-length album.

''Love Is Hell'' included a cover of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]", which Adams had previously performed live, and about which [[Noel Gallagher]] once said, "I never got my head round this song until I went to [see] Ryan Adams play and he did an amazing cover of it."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/12909 | title = The 'Wonder' of Ryan | access-date=April 11, 2007| date=October 31, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> The song earned Adams a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for "[[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance|Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |title=Kanye West is at top of Grammy list |access-date=August 15, 2012 |date=December 8, 2004 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629020925/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>

While on tour to support ''Love Is Hell'' in January 2004, Adams fractured his wrist during a performance at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in Liverpool. Adams fell off the end of the stage into the lowered orchestra pit six feet below, while performing "The Shadowlands". Dates from Adams's European and American tours had to be canceled as a result of his injury.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ryanadams/articles/story/5937118/ryan_adams_cancels_tour | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013081117/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ryanadams/articles/story/5937118/ryan_adams_cancels_tour | url-status = dead | archive-date = October 13, 2007 | title = Ryan Adams Cancels Tour | access-date = April 23, 2007 | date=January 30, 2004 | publisher = Rolling Stone/Wenner Publishing | last = Dansby | first = Andrew}}</ref>

Adams was featured on the album [[True Love (Toots & the Maytals album)|''True Love'']] by [[Toots and the Maytals]], which won the [[Grammy Award]] in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Trey Anastasio]], [[Gwen Stefani]] / [[No Doubt]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Manu Chao]], [[The Roots]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Toots Hibbert]], [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]], Jackie Jackson, [[Ken Boothe]], and [[The Skatalites]].<ref>"True Love – Linear CD Notes."

===The Cardinals (2005–2009)===
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2023}}
{{Main|Ryan Adams and the Cardinals}}
The year 2005 saw Adams join with backing band [[Ryan Adams and the Cardinals|the Cardinals]] to produce two albums, ''[[Cold Roses]]'' and ''[[Jacksonville City Nights]]''. ''Cold Roses'', a double album, included backing vocals from [[Rachael Yamagata]] on three songs; "Let It Ride", "Cold Roses" and "Friends".  His second album of the year, ''Jacksonville City Nights'', featured a duet with [[Norah Jones]] on "Dear John". As well as releasing two albums with The Cardinals, Adams released the solo album ''[[29 (album)|29]]'' late in the year.
[[File:The Cardinals08.jpg|thumb|left|Adams live with The Cardinals in November 2008]]
Adams befriended [[Phil Lesh]] of the [[Grateful Dead]], after first meeting him at the [[Jammys]] awards in New York in 2005. The two performed [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]'s Grateful Dead classic, "Wharf Rat". Adams performed at subsequent outings of [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], including a two-night stand at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] outside of [[Denver]], Colorado and on New Year's Eve 2005 at the Bill Graham Event Center in San Francisco. Throughout 2006, Lesh's live performances included compositions by Adams, including several from ''Cold Roses'' ("Cold Roses", "Let It Ride", and "Magnolia Mountain").

Adams produced [[Willie Nelson]]'s album ''[[Songbird (Willie Nelson album)|Songbird]]'', while he and The Cardinals performed as Nelson's backing band.  The album was released in October 2006.  He also opened for Nelson at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] later that fall, a show that featured [[Phil Lesh]] on bass and multiple [[Grateful Dead]] songs.  Late in 2006, Adams experimented with [[hip hop music]], adding to his web site 18 albums worth of new recordings under various pseudonyms, featuring humorous and nonsensical lyrics, as well as covers of two [[Bob Dylan]] songs ("[[Isis (song)|Isis]]" and "[[You're a Big Girl Now]]").

Adams released his ninth album on June 26, 2007, titled ''[[Easy Tiger]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://main.losthighwayrecords.com/news.aspx?bid=1795 | title = Easy tiger | date = March 30, 2007 | access-date = April 11, 2007 | publisher = [[Lost Highway Records]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212352/http://main.losthighwayrecords.com/news.aspx?bid=1795 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 27, 2007}}</ref> The album includes many tracks which were debuted during 2006's tours, as well as other older tracks which were previously unreleased.

On October 23, 2007, Adams released ''[[Follow the Lights]]'', an EP featuring three new songs: "Follow the Lights","Blue Hotel" and "My Love for You Is Real", along with live studio versions of other previously released songs and a cover of Alice in Chains' "Down In A Hole".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/31208 | title = Ryan Adams reveals details of new EP | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]] | date=September 18, 2007 | access-date=September 21, 2007}}</ref> Adams also appeared as a guest musician on Cowboy Junkies' 2007 album and DVD ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', a 20th-anniversary re-recording of their classic album ''[[The Trinity Session]]''.

===Post-Cardinals (2009)===
In May 2009, drummer [[Brad Pemberton]] stated that: "everyone was a bit fried, so it was the right time to step back for a minute. I encouraged Ryan to go and get married, and have a life and find some peace; the guy hasn't really slowed down in ten years, and he needed it as much as we did.

===Disputes with fans and other artists===
At a concert in October 2002, at Nashville's [[Ryman Auditorium]], someone in the audience yelled out a request for "[[Summer of '69]]", a song by the similarly named [[Bryan Adams]]. Adams reacted with a stream of expletives, and ordered the house lights turned on, ''[[The Tennessean]]'' newspaper reported. He eventually found the fan who made the joke-request, paid him $30 cash as a refund for the show, ordered him to leave, and said he would not play another note until he had left.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73812/ryan-adams-not-amused-by-name-game |title=Ryan Adams Not Amused by Name Game |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=September 19, 2015}}</ref> In a 2014 interview, Ryan Adams denied that the audience-member was asked to leave "for screaming a Bryan Adams song", but rather because the man was drunk: "The reason why the guy was asked to leave by me was because I was doing an a-capella three-piece with [[Gillian Welch]], [[David Rawlings]], and myself of '[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Bartering Lines]]', and in between the quiet parts the guy was screaming."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gabler|first=Jay|url=http://blog.thecurrent.org/2014/10/ryan-adams-clarifies-bryan-adams-stories-says-album-cover-similarity-is-coincidental/|title=Ryan Adams clarifies Bryan Adams stories, says album cover similarity is coincidental &#124; Local Current Blog &#124; The Current from Minnesota Public Radio|website=Blog.thecurrent.org|date=October 17, 2014|access-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/9145/rumors_about_ryan_adamss_dating_life_summer_of_69d/news/ |title=Rumors about Ryan Adams's Dating-Life, "Summer of '69"-Dude Ejection gave been greatly exaggerated |publisher=[[Stereogum]] |date=April 16, 2008 |access-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> In April 2015, Ryan, who had since become friends with Bryan, played "Summer of '69" at the end of another performance at the Ryman, an act described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as "an olive branch to the city that was once his home".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/watch-ryan-adams-redemptive-cover-of-summer-of-69-20150429|title=Watch Ryan Adams' Redemptive Cover of 'Summer of '69{{'-}}|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Leahey|first=Andrew|date=April 29, 2015|access-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

Adams left an angry message on critic [[Jim DeRogatis]]'s answering-machine, in response to a scathing review DeRogatis gave of an Adams show in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/22/ryan-adams-things-got-broken|title=Ryan Adams: 'Things got broken and I couldn't fix them'|last=Simpson|first=Dave|date=September 22, 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 22, 2014}}</ref>

During filming of the BBC's long-running show ''Songwriter's Circle'', where Adams was joined by American folk-singer [[Janis Ian]] and New Zealand's [[Neil Finn]], it was reported that he refused to participate in a number of the songs performed on the night and was generally dismissive of collaborating with the others. The fallout from the show resulted in an online to-and-fro argument between Adams, Ian, and members of the public, who cited Adams's rude behavior and eccentric demeanor toward his colleagues.<ref>{{cite news|last=Teague|first=Marcus|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/ryan-adams-and-neil-finn-fall-out-during-tv-taping-20111026-1mjld.html#ixzz1byKKybKb|title=Ryan Adams and Neil Finn fall out during TV taping|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=October 26, 2011|access-date=October 27, 2011}}</ref> In August 2017, Adams singled out [[Father John Misty]] for criticism,<ref>{{Cite news|first=Taylor|last=Berman|url=http://www.spin.com/2017/08/ryan-adams-father-john-misty-insults-twitter/|title=Ryan Adams Calls Father John Misty the "Most Self-Important Asshole on Earth"|date=August 19, 2017|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Tom|last=Breihan|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1958228/ryan-adams-calls-father-john-misty-the-the-most-self-important-asshole-on-earth/news/|title=Ryan Adams Calls Father John Misty "The Most Self-Important Asshole On Earth"|date=August 19, 2017|work=[[Stereogum]]|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref> while a month earlier he made derogatory remarks about [[the Strokes]] through social media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1955071/ryan-adams-is-roasting-the-strokes-on-twitter-for-some-reason/wheres-the-beef/|title=Ryan Adams Is Roasting The Strokes On Twitter|date=July 31, 2017|work=[[Stereogum]]|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Evan|last=Minsker|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/ryan-adams-does-not-like-the-strokes-blasts-them-on-twitter/|title=Ryan Adams does not like The Strokes, blasts them on Twitter|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=July 31, 2017|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryan-adams-rips-the-strokes-in-twitter-rant-w495244|title=Ryan Adams Rips the Strokes in Twitter Rant|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York City|date=August 1, 2017|access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref>

On February 13, 2019, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that seven women (including [[Phoebe Bridgers]] and ex-wife [[Mandy Moore]]) said Adams offered to assist them with their music careers, then pursued the women romantically. They also claimed that Adams retaliated when they spurned his advances, hindering their careers and harassing them in text messages and on social media.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Joe|last1=Coscarelli|first2=Melena|last2=Ryzik|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ryan-adams-women-sex.html|title=Ryan Adams Dangled Success.

== Recognition ==
Adams is recognized for his highly prolific songwriting and a singing style that resembles that of a country rocker, even though he played [[punk rock]] in the early part of his career. Adams has frequently experimented with different genres, although for the major part of his career his musical style has been [[alternative rock]]. He is also one of the few artists to emerge from the alt-country scene into mainstream commercial success.<ref name="All cobain">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ryan-adams-mn0000808336/biography |title=Ryan Adams' biography and discography|publisher=All Music|first=Mark |last=Deming|access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref>

Signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 2004, she released her first album, ''[[Ride (Shelly Fairchild album)|Ride]]'', in early 2005. It included the single "You Don't Lie Here Anymore", a No.&nbsp;35 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.

==Biography==
Fairchild was born in [[Clinton, Mississippi]], to a musical family.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p682231|pure_url=yes}} |title=Shelly Fairchild biography |accessdate=June 11, 2008 |last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> She began performing at an early age in church and later in her high school's show choir.

On July 29, 2017, Fairchild married the music executive Deborah DeLoach<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vevasound.com |title=VEVA Sound |accessdate= January 19, 2017}}</ref> in [[Vail, Colorado]].

==Career==
In 2004, Fairchild signed to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Her first album, ''[[Ride (Shelly Fairchild album)|Ride]]'', was issued in early 2005. Its lead-off single, "You Don't Lie Here Anymore", co-written with Clay Mills, peaked at No.&nbsp;35 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, although subsequent singles failed to chart. She toured in support of the album including an opening spot on [[Rascal Flatts]]' sold-out ''Here's to You'' tour which also featured [[Blake Shelton]], but was dropped from Columbia by the end of the year.

In 2008, Fairchild signed a record deal with [[Stroudavarious Records]] which was founded by producer [[James Stroud]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/audio/shelly-fairchild-its-all-gonna-work-out|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106212430/http://www.roughstock.com/audio/shelly-fairchild-its-all-gonna-work-out|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2009|title=Shelly Fairchild — "It's All Gonna Work Out"|work=Roughstock|accessdate=January 5, 2009}}</ref> Her first release was the song "It's All Gonna Work Out", which she released for a charity album called ''We Are Enterprise''.

On April 11, 2011, Fairchild's second album,, ''Ruby's Money'', was released. Free from the confines of a major label, she set out to take control of her music and released "Ruby’s Money" on her own label, Revelation Nation Records. She took her unstoppable voice to another level, creating an album that reflected a "Memphis kind of feel" with horns. She co-wrote a song called "Love Everybody", which was an anchor for this record.<ref name="Shelly Fairchild — Sip Magazine">{{cite web|url=https://thesipmag.com/shelly-fairchild/|title=Shelly Fairchild |author=Lauchlin Fields |date=November 2, 2015|work=The 'Sip |accessdate=October 5, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, Fairchild was one of three background singers for [[Martina McBride]]'s "Everlasting Tour". Touring with McBride, Fairchild explained, was a huge highlight of her career. "If someone thinks I’m good enough to come and sing backgrounds for them, I’m like, ‘Yeah’ — especially if it's music I love. Martina is somebody I’ve looked up to as a singer my whole life."<ref name="Shelly Fairchild — Sip Magazine"/>

In 2016, Fairchild did a [[PledgeMusic]] campaign and surpassed her goal by 41% in just two days to record her latest album Buffalo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/shellyfairchild|title=Shelly Fairchild PledgeMusic|work=PledgeMusic|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}</ref>

The band's current line-up consists of Farrar (vocals, guitar), Andrew DuPlantis (bass guitar), John Horton (guitar), Mark Patterson (drums), and Mark Spencer (keyboard, steel guitar). In addition to playing [[alternative rock]], the band is considered a staple of the [[alternative country]] rock movement of the 1990s. The band's sound also is rooted in [[folk rock]] and Americana. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2001,<ref>{{Cite magazine |author= |date=2001-09-27 |title=Jay Farrar Spreads His Solo Wings |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/jay-farrar-spreads-his-solo-wings-78285/ |access-date=2023-03-03 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref> before reforming in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sculley |first=Alan |title=Son Volt returns -- in a sense |url=https://www.eu.heraldtribune.com/story/news/2006/01/27/son-volt-returns-in-a-sense/28458863007/ |access-date=2023-03-03 |website=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
=== Early Years, ''Trace'', ''Straightaways'', and ''Wide Swing Tremolo'' ===
The group formed after the [[Alternative country|alternative country rock]] act [[Uncle Tupelo]] broke up due to tensions between Farrar and bandmate [[Jeff Tweedy]]. After Uncle Tupelo split, Tweedy formed the alternative rock act [[Wilco]], while Farrar decided to form another act. While forming Son Volt, Farrar met Jim and Dave Boquist during the final Uncle Tupelo tour and teamed up with former Uncle Tupelo drummer Mike Heidorn to create the band. The group performed and recorded in the Minneapolis area in late 1994 and performed its first concert at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis on June 16, 1995. While half of the band was rooted in the Minneapolis area, Farrar and Heidorn lived in the St. Louis area, and the band used both cities as bases for its operations during the first couple of years.

Son Volt's first album, ''[[Trace (Son Volt album)|Trace]]'', met with critical acclaim and topped many "best-of" lists in 1995. It was a moderate commercial success; the first track "Windfall" became very popular in the alt-country scene, while the band released "Drown" as a single which charted #10 on the mainstream rock charts and #25 on the modern rock charts. By 2009, ''Trace'' had sold 297,000 copies in the United States.<ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine |last=Ayers |first=Michael D. |date=2009-08-13 |title=Death Cab's Ben Gibbard, Jay Farrar Team Up For Kerouac Soundtrack |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/death-cabs-ben-gibbard-jay-farrar-team-up-for-kerouac-soundtrack-267721/ |access-date=2023-03-02 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref>

1997's ''[[Straightaways]]'' followed in the same vein as ''Trace'' with even a more acoustic feel, leading some music critics to give negative reviews, but strong and positive reviews came from outlets such as the [[Orlando Sentinel]] and the [[Chicago Tribune]]. 1998's ''[[Wide Swing Tremolo]]'' featured a heavier rock sound and received mostly positive reviews from music outlets. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that "many of the songs ... return to the power and purity of the band’s brilliant 1995 debut, ''Trace''."

=== Hiatus and return ===
Farrar announced a hiatus from Son Volt after their 1999 tour. Beginning in 2001, Jay Farrar released several solo efforts that postponed further releases from Son Volt. Farrar reformed with the original members of Son Volt to record a song for a tribute album for [[Alejandro Escovedo]]. The sessions reportedly went so well that Farrar and the other band members intended to record once again in the autumn of 2004. Just prior to the sessions, however, Farrar and the other band members abruptly ended negotiations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jake Brown |url=http://gloriousnoise.com/2004/son_volt_reforms_and_returns_t |title=Son Volt Reforms and Returns to the Studio |date=22 September 2004 |publisher=Glorious Noise |access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref> Farrar formed a new version of the band with a different line-up and released an album on Transmit Sound/Sony Legacy, ''[[Okemah and the Melody of Riot]]'', a folk-rock album based on protest music that had been influenced by [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4817987 |title=Son Volt Is Back: 'Okemah and the Melody of Riot' : World Cafe | website=Npr.org |access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref> in 2005. That same year also saw the release of ''[[A Retrospective: 1995-2000]]'', which gathered highlights from this era, along with previously unreleased recordings. 2006 saw the release of a live DVD, ''Six String Belief'', which was recorded at The Orange Peel in [[Asheville, NC]].

=== Band reformed and new music ===
In 2007, the band returned to an alternative rock and alt-country sound and released a studio album called ''[[The Search (Son Volt album)|The Search]]''. The Americana- and folk-influenced album ''[[American Central Dust]]'' followed, released by Rounder Records on July 7, 2009. Their next project was a [[Bakersfield Sound]]-influenced album aptly named ''[[Honky Tonk (album)|Honky Tonk]]'', which was released March 5, 2013, also by Rounder Records. A large scale tour followed the release of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonvolt.net/ |title=Official Son Volt site |website=Sonvolt.net |access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref> On February 17, 2017, the band released ''[[Notes of Blue]]'' on Farrar's label, Transmit Sound.

=== ''Union'' and ''Electro Melodier'' ===
The band's ninth studio album, ''[[Union (Son Volt album)|Union]]'', was released on March 28, 2019 on Farrar's Transmit Sound label and distributed by Thirty Tigers Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/12/son-volt-to-release-9th-studio-album-union-on-329.html|title=Son Volt to Release 9th Studio Album, "Union" on 3/29|website=Music News Net}}</ref> The album consisted of songs that were highly critical of the election of US President [[Donald Trump]] and his administration. Many of the songs were commentaries on middle-class economics, freedom of the press, and immigration. Son Volt's tenth album, ''[[Electro Melodier]]'', was released on July 30, 2021. In early summer 2021, guitarist Chris Frame announced that he would be leaving the band to pursue other interests and was replaced by former [[Bottle Rockets]] guitarist John Horton. The tribute album ''[[Day of the Doug]]'' followed in 2023.

==Musical style==
Son Volt's music ranges from quiet [[folk music|folk]] ballads reminiscent of ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', to heartland rock in the spirit of [[Neil Young]] with [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]]. The band's sound features a heavy alternative rock sound in many places, all while basing their music in mostly an Americana style.<ref>Stewart, M (2017).[https://livemusicdaily.com/2017/04/13/alt-country-pioneers-son-volt-hit-stride-at-d-c-s-930-club/ "Alt-Country Pioneers Son Volt Hit Stride at D.C.’s 9:30 Club"]''Live Music Daily''</ref> Reviews refer to the band as [[alternative country]] pioneers, a "staple in the ALT-Country Scene" or "a cult favorite", with their music "spanning a few musical niches", but based in [[Americana (music)|Americana]].<ref>Remz, J.B (2019).

Earle released an EP called ''Pink & Black'' in 1982 featuring the Dukes. Acting as Earle's manager, John Lomax sent the EP to [[Epic Records]], and they signed Earle to a recording contract in 1983.<ref name="All Music"/> In 1983, Earle signed a record deal with CBS and recorded a "[[neo-rockabilly]] album".<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times 1993"/>

Earle released ''[[Copperhead Road]]'' on Uni Records in 1988 which was characterized as "a quixotic project that mixed a lyrical folk tradition with hard rock and eclectic Irish influences such as [[The Pogues]], who guested on the record".<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times 1993"/> The album's [[Copperhead Road (song)|title track]] portrays a [[Vietnam veteran]] who uses his family background in running moonshine to become a marijuana grower/seller.<ref name=NPR>[[Steve Inskeep|Inskeep, Steve]] (December 7, 2003) Interview: Steve Earle discusses the political nature of his songwriting, [[NPR Weekend Edition]]</ref> It was Earle's highest-peaking song to date in the United States and has sold 1.1&nbsp;million digital copies there as of September 2017.

In 1994, two staff members at [[Warner/Chappell]] publishing company and Earle's former manager, John Dotson, created an in-house CD of Earle's songs entitled ''Uncut Gems'' and showcased it to some recording artists in Nashville. This resulted in several of Earle's songs being recorded by [[Travis Tritt]], [[Stacy Dean Campbell]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]].<ref name="CMT"/> After his recording hiatus, Earle released ''[[Train a Comin']]'' on Winter Harvest Records and it was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]] in 1996. The album was characterized as a return to the "folksy acoustic" sound of his early career.<ref name="CMT"/>

In 1996, Earle formed his own record label, [[E-Squared Records]], and released the album ''I Feel Alright'', which combined the musical sounds of country, rock and rockabilly.<ref name="CMT"/> Earle released the album ''[[El Corazón (Steve Earle album)|El Corazon]]'' (The Heart) in 1997 which one reviewer called "the capstone of this [Earle's] remarkable comeback".<ref>Warren, Doug (November 20, 2007) "Steve Earle: El Corozon E-Squared/Warner Bros".

Next, he married Lou-Anne Gill (with whom he had a second son, Ian Dublin Earle, in January 1987).

==Political views and activism==
Earle is outspoken with his political views, and often addresses them in his lyrics and in interviews. Politically he identifies as a [[Socialism|socialist]] and tends to vote for Democratic candidates, despite not agreeing entirely with their politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/goodbye-guitar-town-an-interview-with-steve-earle|title=Goodbye Guitar Town: An Interview with Steve Earle|work=PopMatters|date=September 23, 2007 |access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2002/08/earl-a07.html|title=US country singer Steve Earle subjected to witch-hunt|author=Ian Bruce|date=August 7, 2002|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref> During the 2016 election he expressed support for Senator  [[Bernie Sanders]], who he considered to have pushed Hillary Clinton to the left on important issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/interview-steve-earle|title=Interview With Steve Earle|author=Eric Alterman|date=March 19, 2015|work=The Nation|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref> In a 2017 interview Earle said about President [[Donald Trump]]: "We've never had an orangutan in the White House before. There's a lot of 'What does this button do?' going on. It's scary. He really is a fascist. Whether he intended to be or not, he's a real live fascist."<ref name="Betts">{{cite news |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen |title=Steve Earle talks outlaws, Guy Clark and Donald Trump |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/steve-earle-talks-outlaws-guy-clark-and-fascist-trump-194374/ |access-date=1 November 2020 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=17 August 2017}}</ref> However, Earle has called for the American left to engage with the concerns of working class Trump voters, saying in 2017: "…maybe that's one of the things we need to examine from my side because we're responsible. The left has lost touch with American people, and it's time to discuss that".<ref name="Toto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/steve-earle-trump-supporters/|title=Socialist Steve Earle: Stop Demonizing Trump Supporters|date=February 29, 2020|website=Hollywood in Toto|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref> In 2020, he stated: "I thought that, given the way things are now, it was maybe my responsibility to make a record that spoke to and for people who didn't vote the way that I did. One of the dangers that we're in is if people like me keep thinking that everyone who voted for Trump is a racist or an asshole, then we're fucked, because it's simply not true."<ref name="Toto"/>

In his 1990 song "Justice in Ontario", Earle sang about the [[Port Hope 8 case]]. Earle criticized the conviction of six [[Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club|Satan's Choice]] bikers for a 1978 murder in [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], arguing that the accused were innocent, framed by the ruthless Corporal [[Terry Hall (policeman)|Terry Hall]] of the Ontario Provincial Police's Special Squad.<ref name="Newton">{{cite news |last1=Newton |first1=Steve |title=25 years ago: Steve Earle talks bikers, executions, and "Justice in Ontario" |url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/554181/25-years-ago-steve-earle-talks-bikers-executions-and-justice-ontario |access-date=October 30, 2020 |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=October 11, 1990}}</ref> In the song Earle compares the conviction of the "Port Hope 6" to the massacre of the [[Black Donnellys]] in 1880. In 1990, Earle stated in an interview about "Justice in Ontario": "There's some concern about reprisals because the O.P.P. (Ontario Provincial Police) is obviously not gonna be thrilled. My hope is that I'll be far too out-in-the-open and far too public for the police to do anything and get away with it. But the point is, that's not a reason for doing or not doing anything, because…I very nearly went to prison myself for something I didn't do, simply because a law enforcement agency didn't want to admit that somebody had fucked up—they didn't want to open the whole can of worms and all the other complaints that were constantly brought against the [[Dallas]] police department. You can't stand by and let stuff like that go down without saying anything about it. And I think I especially have a responsibility to do that, 'cause if I didn't have any money right now I'd be in prison in Texas—I'm convinced of that. It was that close. But I was able to afford decent legal representation. And it comes down to the fact that people who can't afford decent legal representation—who are subject to something like this happening and turning out very badly—feed my kids. That's where my money comes from and that's where my freedom comes from".<ref name="Newton"/>

Earle is a vocal opponent of [[Capital punishment debate in the United States|capital punishment]],<ref name="CMT"/> which he considers his primary area of political activism. Several of his songs have provided descriptions of the experiences of [[death row]] inmates, including "Billy Austin" and "Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song)".<ref name=NPR/> Conversely, he has also written a song from the perspective of a prison guard working on death row in "Ellis Unit One", a song written for the film [[Dead Man Walking (film)|''Dead Man Walking'']], the title based on the name of the [[Ellis Unit One|State of Texas men's death row]].<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-12-28-ca-13103-story.html "Dead Man Walking" Ambles Away With Year's Top Singles] Los Angeles Times. December 28, 1996.</ref> He is pro-choice and has argued that rich Americans have always had access to abortions; he says the political issue in the US is really whether poor women should have access. His 2012 novel ''I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive'' describes the life of a morphine-addicted doctor in 1963 San Antonio before ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' who treats gunshot wounds and provides illegal abortions to poor women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/politics-as-usual-with-steve-earle/Content?oid=2697112|title=Politics as usual with Steve Earle|work=Creative Loafing Charlotte|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref> Since his youngest son was diagnosed with [[autism]], Earle has also become an advocate for people on the autism spectrum.

Simpson formed the country rock band Sunday Valley in 2004,<ref name = RS/> which played at the Pickathon festival in [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name=AllMusic-Bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sturgill-simpson-mn0003098721/biography|title=Sturgill Simpson: Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> He later moved to Nashville, but says he "didn't have the foggiest notion of how to hustle my music ... [it] was a total bust."<ref name = RS/>

Setting his musical ambitions aside, Simpson focused on building a career at a [[Salt Lake City]] railroad freight-shipping yard for [[Union Pacific Railroad]], which he eventually ended up managing. He credits his wife and friends with changing what he characterized as a hobbyist focus on songwriting and playing to convincing him to get serious about music as a potential career.<ref name=CharlieRose-SailorsGuide-2016 /> After playing local [[open mic]]s and gigs, Simpson returned to Sunday Valley, touring and making an album with the band and producer [[Duane Lundy]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Powers |first=Brian |date=2017-07-22 |title=Duane Lundy's Crossfade Moment |url=https://undermain.art/performing-arts/duane-lundys-crossfade-moment/ |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=UnderMain |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Rodgers |first=D.

Simpson had planned to take a break from touring for the entirety of 2017 to focus on his family, but reconsidered after his Grammy nominations.

===2018–2020: ''Sound & Fury'' and ''Cuttin' Grass''===
In a March 5, 2018, interview on ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'' podcast, Simpson revealed that he was working on his fourth studio album, and hinted that it would be a [[double album]], though this was ultimately not the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0IqNaE513w|title=Joe Rogan Experience #1087 - Sturgill Simpson|last=PowerfulJRE|date=March 5, 2018|access-date=June 19, 2019|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The title, ''[[Sound & Fury (Sturgill Simpson album)|Sound & Fury]]'', was announced on July 21, 2019, at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Simpson describing it as a "sleazy, steamy rock'n'roll record". A companion [[anime]] film bearing the same name was also released on [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/sturgill-simpson-new-album-anime-film-sound-and-fury-netflix-861660/|title=Sturgill Simpson Announces New Album, Anime Film 'Sound & Fury'|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=July 21, 2019|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The album was officially made available for pre-order on August 20, 2019, with the track "Sing Along" being released the same day.

In a 2020 interview, Simpson described ''Sound & Fury'' as a record born from "burnout," especially in reaction to his 2017 tours, as well as the realization that he had become disillusioned with the music industry. He cut off contact with Elektra and refused to give them any material after the release of ''Sound & Fury''. Simpson claimed that Elektra "[did not] know what the fuck to do" with him, as he created ''Sound & Fury'' to be difficult to market, and left Elektra with a "giant un-recouped debt" upwards of a million dollars from costs relating to the album's companion film, which was similarly hard to promote. In the same interview, Simpson heavily criticized record labels, calling them overly controlling yet noncontributory, and claimed that he was manipulated into signing a record contract by people who were no longer in his life. He also claimed that his Grammy nominations for ''A Sailor's Guide To Earth'' were a scheme for the record labels to get a return on their investment, and had nothing to do with him or his music, referencing [[Grammy Awards#Criticism|frequent criticisms]] of bias and "secret committees" within the Grammys.<ref name="Hyden" />

'''The Departed''' (also known as '''Cody Canada and the Departed''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band. The band was formed in 2011 by [[Cody Canada]], the former lead vocalist and guitarist for [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] after that band broke up in 2010. The band currently consists of Canada (guitars and lead vocals), Jeremy Plato (bass guitar and vocals), and [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] (drums).

==Formation==
After Oklahoma based southern rock band [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] broke up in 2010, [[Cody Canada]] decided to start the Departed that was billed by Texas and Oklahoma music scene observers as a "Super Group." Canada remained on lead vocals and lead guitar and former Ragweed bass guitar player Jeremy Plato joined Canada. Canada recruited friend and Texas based blues rock singer and songwriter Seth James to be co-lead on guitar and vocals, well known red dirt keyboardist Steve Littleton, and fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma]] native Dave Bowen on drums. Naming themselves "The Departed" as all had left previous bands to join together, the group at first billed themselves as "Cody Canada and The Departed" namely for fan recognition according to the band members in a 2011 interview.

==''This Is Indian Land''==
The band released its first album in June 2011 titled ''This Is Indian Land'' through its own record label, Underground Sound. The record was a tribute album to Oklahoma music and songwriters. The band's cover version of the Red Dirt Rangers song "Staring Down the Sun" was the only released single from the album. Two other songs, "The Ballad of Rosalie" and "Skyline Radio" both charted on the Texas and Oklahoma music charts.

==''Adventūs''==
On August 24, 2012, now billed as simply The Departed, the band announced on its website and in social media that it would release its first original album, ''Adventūs'' (Latin for "arrival") on November 13, 2012, on Underground Sound. Bowen had left the group and was replaced by Chris Doege on the drums. The band moved to an [[alternative rock]] and grunge sound with driving electric guitars and the power vocals of James and Canada. Three singles were released: "Worth The Fight", "Prayer For the Lonely" and "Flagpole".

==''HippieLovePunk'' & Line-Up Changes==
In September 2013, Seth James announced that he intended to leave the band. The parting was amicable; as James said. "After three years of great times and great music, I have decided to take a step down as a band member of the Departed. It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/cody-canada-announces-the-departed-lineup-changes-new-solo-acoustic-live-album-due-this-fall/article/3883601 |title=Cody Canada announces The Departed lineup changes, new solo acoustic live album due this fall |author= Brandy McDonnell |date= September 16, 2013 |work=NewsOK }}</ref> The band continued performing as a four-piece group.

In 2014, the band finished a new album, ''HippieLovePunk''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/5-minutes-in-texas-with-cody-canada-20140721 |title=5 Minutes in Texas With Cody Canada|author= Jim Casey |date=July 21, 2014 |magazine= Rolling Stone }}</ref> It was released on January 13, 2015, and debuted at No. 9 on the Top [[Alternative Country]] Albums chart, with 4,700 copies sold in the US in its first week. The sound was, for the most part, still like the alt-rock sound of ''Adventūs''.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://roughstock.com/news/2015/01/32254-country-album-chart-report-january-21-2015/|title=Country Album Chart Report For January 21, 2015 |author= Matt Bjorke |date=January 21, 2015 |work=Roughstock }}</ref> Cody Canada and The Departed, as the band was once again known, debuted a new line-up at The MusicFest in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on January 8, 2015. [[East Texas]] native Ross Smith replaced Littleton on keyboards and took up rhythm guitars, while [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] became the drummer in place of Doege. In late November 2015, the band produced a music video for the song "All Nighter" on ''HippieLovePunk'' at John T. Floore's Country Store in [[Helotes, Texas]]. The song and the video were dedicated to the former bass guitar player for [[Micky and the Motorcars]] Mark McCoy, who had died in [[Idaho]] in 2012 while on vacation. The songs "Inbetweener" and "Easy" were released as singles.

==''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect''==
In early 2016, the band announced on social media that it would be releasing an album consisting of cover versions of classic country songs. This project was named ''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect'', honoring 1960s era country music with songs by [[Johnny Paycheck]], Stonewall Jackson and [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]], among others. The bass guitarist, Plato, took the lead vocals and had Canada, Smith and Hansen as his backing on the project. [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly's]] Cody Braun and Cody Angel of Jason Boland and the Stragglers contributed their instrumentation to the project, as well as the folk singer Jamie Lin Wilson, who sang backing vocals and also appeared on a popular duet with Plato.

==''3''==
In early 2017, Ross Smith left the band and The Departed became a 3 piece set with Canada, Plato, and Hansen. On April 20, 2018 the band released the single "Lipstick" from their new album ''3'', that was released on June 29, 2018, by the Underground Sound Label. [[Mike McClure]], who had produced several of Cross Canadian Ragweed's albums, came back to produce the album. The name of the album comes from the number of those who were left in the band. It was also their 3rd album of original content as '''In Retrospect''', and '''Indian Land''' had both been cover albums.

==Current==
Due to the band's current lineup, several popular Cross Canadian Ragweed songs have made their way back into the Departed's nightly set list in addition to the new material the band has written. Canada said in a 2018 Rolling Stone interview that he was "truly happy with the way the band is now and I feel this is the band I have always wanted, and really deserved."

'''The Flatlanders''' are an American [[country music|country band]] from [[Lubbock, Texas]], founded in 1972 by [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]], [[Joe Ely]] and [[Butch Hancock]].<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1606/biography}}</ref> The group garnered little success during their brief original incarnation from 1972 to 1973, but when the individual members found success in their solo careers, interest in The Flatlanders was rekindled with the band reuniting several times since. An earlier incarnation of this band was known as The Double Mountain Fork Of The Brazos River Boys.

==History==
In 1972, Gilmore, Ely and Hancock, formed The Flatlanders with each contributing vocals, guitar, and songwriting skills. Other key musicians were Steve Wesson on [[autoharp]] and [[musical saw]], Tony Pearson on [[mandolin]] and backup harmony, [[Tommy Hancock]] (no relation to Butch Hancock) on [[fiddle]] and Syl Rice on [[string bass]].

One of the band's first appearances was at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]] in 1972, where they were named one of the winners of the inaugural Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Singer/Songwriter Competition.

The band's first recording project was produced in 1972 by Shelby Singleton, the then-owner of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis, Tennessee's]] famed [[Sun Studios]]. A promotional single, Gilmore's "Dallas", was a commercial failure, and the planned album, ''All American Music'', was all but scrapped, being released only in a limited run on [[Stereo 8|8-track tape]] in order to fulfill contractual obligations. 

The Flatlanders performed through 1973 before disbanding. By the end of the decade, however, Gilmore, Ely and Hancock had all found success as solo performers, and rumors of their earlier obscure collaboration began to circulate. In 1990, [[Rounder Records]] issued the 1972 sessions as ''More a Legend Than a Band''.

The three musicians continued to reunite for occasional Flatlanders performances. In 1998 they contributed to the soundtrack of ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', and then in 2002 released their follow-up album, ''Now Again,'' on [[New West Records]].  In 2004 this was followed with ''Wheels of Fortune'', again on New West. In 2004, New West released ''Live '72'' a live recording of the then-unknown country band performing at the One Knite [[honky-tonk]] in [[Austin, Texas]].

In 2009, The Flatlanders released the album, ''Hills & Valleys''. In promotion of the album, the group appeared as musical guests on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' on July 21, 2009, and on Garrison Keillor's ''A Prairie Home Companion'' on April 27, 2013.

In 2012, The Flatlanders released ''The Odessa Tapes'', an album composed of unreleased recordings culled from 1972 recording sessions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Premiere: The Flatlanders, 'Shadow Of The Moon' |date=June 11, 2012 |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/song-premiere-the-flatlanders-shadow-of-the-moon/ |publisher=America Songwriter |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>

The Flatlanders were voted into the Austin Music Awards Hall of Fame in March 2016. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2016/03/16/country-band-the-flatlanders-inducted-into-austin-music-awards-hall-of-fame|title=Country band The Flatlanders inducted into Austin Music Awards Hall of Fame - The Daily Texan|website=Dailytexanonline.com}}</ref>

Despite a sizable amount of original material, The Gourds are probably best known for a song they did not write, and for which they initially did not receive credit. A recording of the band's cover of [[Snoop Dogg]]'s "[[Gin and Juice]]" was widely shared on the popular file-sharing site [[Napster]], with the song miscredited to the band [[Phish]].<ref name="lieck">{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2000-06-16/77606/|title=Dancing About Architecture: The Gourds weren't Phishing for trouble when they covered "Gin and Juice"; the Meat Puppets have (probably) found a new home|last=Lieck|first=Ken|date=16 June 2000|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|access-date=17 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/10060-the-gourds|title=The Gourds - Artist Profile|website=eventseeker.com|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://delawareliberal.net/2019/07/17/song-of-the-day-7-17-the-gourds-gin-and-juice/|title=Song of the Day 7/17: The Gourds, "Gin and Juice"|date=17 July 2019|website=Delaware Liberal|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> In fact, for most of the 16 years following their first live performance of the song,<ref>[http://www.discorder.ca/oldsite/features/02novgourds.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201155745/http://www.discorder.ca/oldsite/features/02novgourds.html|date=February 1, 2008}}</ref> fans could regularly be heard calling out for the band's [[cover version]] of the song, sometimes before the show had even started.

'''The Mavericks''' are an American [[country music]] band from [[Miami]], Florida. The band consists of [[Raul Malo]] (lead vocals, bass guitar), Paul Deakin (drums), [[Eddie Perez (guitarist)|Eddie Perez]] (lead guitar), and Jerry Dale McFadden (keyboards). Malo and Deakin founded the band in 1989 along with Robert Reynolds (bass guitar) and Ben Peeler (lead guitar). After one independent album, the band was signed by [[MCA Nashville Records]] and [[David Lee Holt]] replaced Peeler on lead guitar; he would be replaced by Nick Kane shortly after their second MCA album and third overall 1994's ''[[What a Crying Shame]]''. The band recorded a total of four albums for MCA and one for [[Mercury Records]] before disbanding in 2000. They reunited for one album in 2003 on [[Sanctuary Records]], by which point Perez had become their fourth guitarist, and former touring keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden became an official fifth member. The lineup of Malo, Deakin, Reynolds, Perez, and McFadden reunited a second time in 2012 for a series of new albums, first on [[Big Machine Records]]' Valory imprint and then on Mono Mundo. Reynolds was fired in 2014 and Ed Friedland served as touring bassist until 2023, with Malo taking the role of bassist soon afterward.

The Mavericks have charted 15 times on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts; their highest-peaking single there is "[[All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down]]", a collaboration with accordionist [[Flaco Jiménez]] which reached number 13 in 1996. Three of their singles made top 10 on the country music charts of the defunct ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' magazine in Canada, and "[[Dance the Night Away (The Mavericks song)|Dance the Night Away]]" was a hit single in the United Kingdom in 1998. Their most commercially successful album ''What a Crying Shame'' has been [[music recording certification|certified platinum]] in the United States and double-platinum in Canada. In addition, the band has received one [[Grammy Award]], two [[Country Music Association]] awards, and three [[Academy of Country Music]] awards. Their sound is defined by a wide variety of musical styles outside of country music, such as [[Tejano music|Tejano]], [[Music of Latin America|Latin]], [[Americana music|Americana]], and the [[pop music]] of the 1950s, with particular emphasis on Malo's singing voice.

===1992{{ndash}}1993: ''From Hell to Paradise''===
Due to the independent album's success throughout the Miami music community, the band was invited to perform for a showcase in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at which talent scouts for major country music labels were present. One of these labels, [[MCA Nashville]], signed the band in May 1991.<ref name="allmusic"/> According to [[Colin Larkin]] in the ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', the band was signed before they had finished their [[soundcheck]].<ref name="virgin"/> Peeler was fired from his role as guitarist in October 1991 due to concerns from the other three band members and their then-manager that his playing was not suitable for a country music band.<ref name="move"/> He was replaced by [[David Lee Holt]], a [[session musician]] who had also played for [[Joe Ely]] and [[Carlene Carter]].<ref name="allmusic"/> After Holt joined, the band began recording their first MCA album ''[[From Hell to Paradise]]'' at Miami-based Criteria Studios late in 1991. Malo wrote the title track, which was about his parents emigrating from [[Cuba]] to the United States.

===1999{{ndash}}2003: ''Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90's: The Best of the Mavericks'', disbanding, and first reunion===

The band's only release for Mercury was a greatest hits compilation called ''[[Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90's: The Best of The Mavericks]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> They chose to release a greatest-hits album due to their recognition in Europe, where they found that such compilations tended to be commercially successful. For this project, each band member selected both singles and album cuts, along with four previously unreleased songs.<ref name="myth page 2"/> Among the new songs were covers of [[Buck Owens]]' "[[Think of Me (Buck Owens song)|Think of Me]]" and [[Cat Stevens]]' "[[Here Comes My Baby (Cat Stevens song)|Here Comes My Baby]]",<ref name="myth page 2"/> the latter released as a single.<ref name="whitburn"/> ''Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90's'' was certified gold in the United Kingdom by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for sales of 100,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/award/6731-1908-2 | title=Search results for ''The Best of The Mavericks'' | publisher=BPI | accessdate=February 13, 2022 | archive-date=February 14, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214022450/https://www.bpi.co.uk/award/6731-1908-2 | url-status=live }}</ref> Despite the commercial success in other countries, the band continued to find lessened success in the United States. Also in 1999, Reynolds divorced Yearwood; she would marry [[Garth Brooks]] in 2005.<ref name="whitburn"/> By the end of the decade, the Mavericks had disbanded. Buchanan said that the band was "at loggerheads with their record company".<ref name="allmusic"/> Malo stated at the time that the decision to disband was due to creative exhaustion brought on by extensive touring, combined with unspecified disputes between Kane and the rest of the band.<ref name="want 3"/>

After the disbanding, Kane released a solo album of cover songs in 2000 titled ''Songs in the Key of E''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/498600709/ | title=Nick Kane continues to push the envelope | work=The Leader-Post | date=March 2, 2000 | accessdate=February 13, 2022 | pages=C3 | archive-date=February 15, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220215000215/https://www.newspapers.com/image/498600709/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Malo recorded both as a solo artist and as a member of [[Los Super Seven]], a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] that also included Mexican-American country singers [[Rick Trevino]] and [[Freddy Fender]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/los-super-seven-mn0000361853/biography | title=Los Super Seven biography |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Jason Ankeny | archive-date=February 11, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211054923/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/los-super-seven-mn0000361853/biography | url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, Reynolds recorded one album with the supergroup Swag, which also included members of [[Cheap Trick]], [[Wilco]], and [[Sixpence None the Richer]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://azdailysun.com/swag-not-your-average-nashville-band/article_d63ecc1b-89be-5d38-99aa-ed1c520f1920.html | title=SWAG: not your average Nashville band | publisher=Arizona Daily Sun | date=March 8, 2001 | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Jim Patterson | archive-date=February 11, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211054924/https://azdailysun.com/swag-not-your-average-nashville-band/article_d63ecc1b-89be-5d38-99aa-ed1c520f1920.html | url-status=live }}</ref> In 2000, McFadden joined [[Trent Summar & the New Row Mob]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mtv.com/news/p2hwpk/trent-summar-returns-with-flair | title=Trent Summar Returns With Flair: Ex-Hank Flamingo star assembles all-star New Row Mob. | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=August 10, 2000 | access-date=January 26, 2023 | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617204006/https://www.mtv.com/news/p2hwpk/trent-summar-returns-with-flair | url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Mavericks reunited in 2003, with [[Eddie Perez (guitarist)|Eddie Perez]] as their fourth guitarist.

For live shows, Reynolds moved from playing playing bass guitar to acoustic guitar; Ed Friedland was hired as the group's touring bassist. This was due to Reynolds having developed an addiction to [[opiate]]s that was affecting his playing.

On August 21, 2020, the band released ''En Español,'' their first album entirely in the Spanish language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904366868/the-mavericks-are-back-this-time-en-espanol|title=The Mavericks Are Back, This Time 'En Español'|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=2020-08-24|archive-date=2024-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617204948/https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904366868/the-mavericks-are-back-this-time-en-espanol|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="allmusic"/> Deming stated in AllMusic that, while the album contained fewer country and pop influences than its predecessors, it also emphasized the band's Latin music roots more fully than previous projects. He concluded his review by stating that it was "adventurous and crafted with heart and skill, and that's what they've always done best."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/en-espa%C3%B1ol-mw0003394668 | title=''En Español'' |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Mark Deming | archive-date=February 12, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212000838/https://www.allmusic.com/album/en-espa%C3%B1ol-mw0003394668 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Friedland left their touring band in 2023, at which point Malo took over on bass in addition to his role as lead singer.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/the-mavericks-played-to-an-insatiable-crowd-at-tannahills-in-fort-worth-18594404 | title=The Mavericks Let the Good Times Roll in Fort Worth's Stockyards | publisher=Dallas Observer | date=February 10, 2024 | accessdate=May 4, 2024 | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617205541/https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/the-mavericks-played-to-an-insatiable-crowd-at-tannahills-in-fort-worth-18594404 | url-status=live }}</ref> The band announced their next album, ''Moon & Stars'', would be released in May 2024.

On June 27, 2024, Malo announced via social media that he had been diagnosed with [[intestinal cancer]]. Because of treatments, the band had to cancel several shows throughout the latter half of 2024.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.syracuse.com/music/2024/06/mavericks-singer-announces-he-has-cancer-and-then-goes-to-work-at-syracuses-jazz-fest-photos.html | last=Miller | first=Charlie | title=Mavericks singer announces he has cancer and then goes to work at Syracuse's Jazz Fest | website=Syracuse.com | date=June 28, 2024 | accessdate=June 28, 2024 | archive-date=June 28, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240628125232/https://www.syracuse.com/music/2024/06/mavericks-singer-announces-he-has-cancer-and-then-goes-to-work-at-syracuses-jazz-fest-photos.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Musical styles==
At the time of their signing with MCA, The Mavericks were seen as unusual in country music due not only to Malo's Cuban-American ancestry, but also to the band's origins in Miami, Florida.<ref name="nash hell"/> This was because at the time, the Miami music scene was better known for [[hip hop music]] and [[dance music]] than for country.<ref name="move"/> Many reviewers have considered Malo's role as lead singer and songwriter an integral part of the band's sound. In a review of ''From Hell to Paradise'', Alanna Nash described Malo's singing voice as "a tight, pinched [[vibrato]] that carries all the tension of a high-voltage wire".<ref name="nash hell"/> Writing for AllMusic, John D. Buchanan described ''What a Crying Shame'' as "a grand showcase for the rich, emotive vocals of Raul Malo and the band's eclectic but accessible approach."<ref name="allmusic"/> In a review of ''Trampoline'' for the same site, Thom Owens stated that Malo's voice was the defining characteristic of the band's sound; he wrote that, through his singing and production, Malo was the "driving force behind all of the group's stylistic fusions, their blend of honky tonk with country-rock, classic rock & roll, pop, and Latin."<ref name="owens trampoline">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/trampoline-mw0000009448 | title=''Trampoline'' review |  work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network  | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Thom Owens | archive-date=June 17, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240617205158/https://www.allmusic.com/album/trampoline-mw0000009448 | url-status=live }}</ref> Of the songwriting, Owens continued that Malo was "among the most imaginative [[Americana (music)|roots]] songwriting of the '90s."<ref name="owens trampoline"/> [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], a record producer who was also the head of [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) of MCA Nashville at the time of the band's signing, described Malo as "bigger than life" in a way that he compared to [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] lead singer [[Randy Owen]]; Brown also thought that having a "great frontman" was key to a country music band's success.<ref name="move"/>

Music critics have defined the band's musical styles with a wide variety of influences. Brown thought that the success of new bands in the 1990s such as [[Diamond Rio]], combined with the commercial appeal of more rock-influenced country bands such as [[The Kentucky Headhunters]], would lead to The Mavericks' success.<ref name="move"/> Nash wrote that they "constitute country’s coolest ensemble, synthesizing ’50s country and ’60s pop and rock with intelligence, verve, and cultural variety."<ref name="occasions ew"/> John D. Buchanan of AllMusic said of the band that "Fusing traditional country with a rich variety of rock, pop, and Latin influences, the Mavericks became one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups of the early '90s."<ref name="allmusic"/> Rick Bell of the ''North County Times'', in a review of ''Trampoline'', noted that the band's use of [[horn section]]s and [[string section]]s on the album gave it a "fuller sound" that complemented Malo's "velvety baritone".<ref name="rick bell">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/577370379/ | title=Review: The Mavericks, ''Trampoline'' | work=North County Times | date=May 8, 1998 | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | pages=23 | archive-date=February 15, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220215000019/https://www.newspapers.com/image/577370379/ | url-status=live }}</ref>  Mark Deming highlighted Nick Kane's "fine [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] jazz picking" in a review of ''Music for All Occasions''. He also found influences of [[Country-western two-step|two-step]] in the album's "The Writing on the Wall" and [[Tejano music]] through the use of [[accordion]] on "All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down",<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-all-occasions-mw0000645060 | title=''Music for All Occasions'' | work=AllMusic | publisher=All Media Network | accessdate=February 11, 2022 | author=Mark Deming | archive-date=February 11, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211045334/https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-all-occasions-mw0000645060 | url-status=live }}</ref> while Joel Bernstein of Country Standard Time compared the latter to [[Cajun music]] for the same reason. He also described the band's cover of "Blue Moon" as "[[Roy Orbison]] meets [[Dean Martin]]".<ref name="cst music"/> Deming stated in a review of ''What a Crying Shame'' that "Robert Reynolds and Paul Deakin are a rhythm section who can give these songs the nervy drive of a rock band without betraying the Mavericks' country leanings, and they give the covers of 'All That Heaven Will Allow' and 'O What a Thrill' a taut foundation most contemporary Nashville acts lack."<ref name="deming shame"/>

'''The Sadies''' are a Canadian [[rock and roll]] / [[country and western]] band from [[Toronto, Ontario]]. The band consists of Travis Good, Sean Dean and Mike Belitsky. [[Dallas Good]], a founding member, died in 2022.  Dallas and Travis are the sons of Margaret and Bruce Good, and nephews of Brian and Larry Good, who are members of the Canadian [[country music|country]] group [[The Good Brothers]].

==Background==
The Sadies were formed in 1994.  In 1998 the group released their first album, ''Precious Moments''.  Several more albums followed, including ''In Concert Vol. 1'' in 2006.<ref name="Inc.2006">{{cite magazine|title=Reviews: New and Noteworthy|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA76|date=12 August 2006|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=76–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

In addition to their own recordings, the Sadies often collaborate with other artists, such as [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Jon Langford]], [[Gord Downie]], [[Andre Williams (musician)|Andre Williams]] (on the 1999 country-influenced ''Red Dirt'' and the 2012 release entitled "Night and Day"), [[Neil Young]] (track "This Wheel’s on Fire" on the album ''Garth Hudson Presents a Canadian Celebration of The Band''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/this-wheels-on-fire-mt0039831969 |title=This Wheels on Fire - The Sadies, Neil Young &#124; Song Info |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=4 April 2020}}</ref>) and have recorded, written and toured extensively as the backing band for singer [[Neko Case]].  They have also toured and recorded with Jon Spencer and Matt Verta-Ray as [[Heavy Trash]], as well as [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]]. They are considered honorary members of [[The Mekons]]. The 2005 documentary ''Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream'' features music by The Sadies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466732/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cl_sm |website=IMDb |access-date=12 June 2023}}</ref> The Sadies' music is featured in many films and television shows, for example, [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]''. An instrumental performed by the band can be heard in episode 5 of season 1, during a scene in which Rhoda the bartender is murdered. 
On 18 May 2010, The Sadies released ''[[Darker Circles]]'' CD/LP through Outside Music and Yep Roc Records. ''Darker Circles'' was a shortlisted nominee for the [[2010 Polaris Music Prize]] and in 2012, won a [[Juno Award]] with Mike Roberts for best video.<ref name=AuxPolaris>{{Cite news |last=Thompson |first=Ciaran |title=Karkwa win 2010 Polaris Music Prize |url=http://www.aux.tv/newmusic/music-news/karkwa-win-2010-polaris-music-prize/ |publisher=[[Aux (TV channel)|Aux]] |date=20 September 2010 |access-date=21 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719085551/http://www.aux.tv/newmusic/music-news/karkwa-win-2010-polaris-music-prize/ |archive-date=19 July 2012 }}</ref>

'''The Swearengens''' are an American [[alternative country]] band formed in 2010 in [[Seattle]].

==Background==
The band consists of [[Fredd Luongo]] on vocals and guitar, Soren Godbersen on guitars and "Cadillacs, etc.", Forrest Marowitz on bass and backing vocals, and Jesse Harmonson on drums. All of their songs are written by frontman Fredd. They can often be found playing, and sipping a beverage, at places in [[Seattle]] like the [http://www.tractortavern.com/ Tractor Tavern], the [http://www.conorbyrnepub.com/welcome/#about Conor Byrne Pub] and the [http://www.littleredhen.com/ Little Red Hen].

The band has been described as: "From epic road songs to tear-stained tales of heartache, from Texas-style rockers to dark-humored murder ballads, The Swearengens cover a lot of musical and emotional territory in their twisted attempt at reviving the glory days alt-country of [[Whiskeytown]], [[The Jayhawks]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Uncle Tupelo]], and [[Steve Earle]]."

The band released their first album, ''[[Devil Gets Her Way]]'', on June 30, 2012. It was named one of "Seattle's Best Country Albums of 2012" by [[Seattle Weekly]].<ref>Gwendolyn Elliott [http://archive.seattleweekly.com/home/915910-129/lissssssssts "Seattle's Top Country Albums of 2012"]. ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', December 12, 2012.</ref> Their second album, ''[[Waiting On The Sunrise]]'', was released on June 8, 2013. It was named one of the "Top Ten Albums of 2013" by Leigh Bezezekoff at [[KEXP-FM]].<ref>[http://blog.kexp.org/2013/12/18/kexp-staff-volunteers-interns-top-ten-albums-of-2013-part-1/ "KEXP Staff, Volunteers & Interns Top Ten Albums of 2013, Part 1"].

'''Todd Daniel Snider''' (born October 11, 1966) <ref>{{cite book |last= Larkin |first= Colin |date= 2009 |title= Encyclopedia of Popular Music |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313734.001.0001/acref-9780195313734-e-73223?rskey=3jwPcM&result=24917 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780199726363}}</ref> is an American singer-songwriter whose music incorporates elements of folk, rock, blues, alt country, and funk.

==Early career==
Snider was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], but was raised in nearby [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], where he lived until he graduated from [[Beaverton High School]] in 1985. After high school, he moved to [[Santa Rosa, California]], to attend [[Santa Rosa Junior College]]. He only lasted one semester, but while there, he learned to play the harmonica.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Shapiro | first = Michael | title = Todd Snider recalls his Santa Rosa days | newspaper = [[The Press Democrat]] | date = September 21, 2014 | url = https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/entertainment/todd-snider-recalls-his-santa-rosa-days/ |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

With help from his brother Mike who bought him a plane ticket, Snider relocated to [[San Marcos, Texas]], after leaving SRJC in late fall of 1985.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn't Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 78–79 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref> Not long after he arrived in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], Snider saw [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] perform solo at [[Gruene Hall]], a legendary dance hall in [[New Braunfels, Texas]].<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> When he saw Walker that night, he decided he wanted to become a songwriter and began writing songs the next day.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy |date= April 14, 2012 |title= It All Started One Night in the '80s at Gruene Hall |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/us/todd-snider-records-a-tribute-to-jerry-jeff-walker.html |newspaper= The New York Times |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> He told ''Lone Star Music Magazine'' in 2004, "I didn't even know how to really play guitar yet, but I saw his show and went and got one."<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider met [[Kent Finlay]] at his very first writer's night, which was at Finlay's San Marcos club, [[Cheatham Street Warehouse]]. Finlay, who was a songwriter in his own right, became an important mentor and introduced Snider to the songs of [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Guy Clark]], [[John Prine]], and [[Shel Silverstein]], among others.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider soon was packing small rooms in San Marcos and over the next few years began to draw enthusiastic crowds in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], as well.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y'Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider also discovered [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] songwriter [[Keith Sykes (musician)|Keith Sykes]] while living in San Marcos when a friend at the local record store turned him on to a pair of albums Sykes made in the early ’70s.<ref>{{cite news |last= Boehm |first= Mike |date= July 29, 1995 |title= Country's Todd Snider: The Man of Still : Pop: The genre has changed over the years, but the artist remains true to traditional styles, as his 'Songs for the Daily Planet' shows |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-29-ca-29116-story.html |newspaper= Los AngelesTimes |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> In 1989, Snider's father moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and happened to meet Sykes’ sister-in-law. Through that connection, Snider sent Sykes a demo tape of some of his songs. Sykes thought one of the songs had potential, so Snider moved to Memphis to try to work with Sykes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn't Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 86–87 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref>

Not long after he arrived in Memphis, Snider landed a weekly residency at a local club The Daily Planet. He not only was soon packing the room, the audience knew the words to the songs and would sing along.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 267 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref>

Through Sykes, Snider met [[John Prine]] in 1991 while assisting on pre-production work Prine was doing with Sykes in Memphis for his album ''[[The Missing Years (album)|The Missing Years]]''. It was the beginning of a friendship that would last until Prine's death in 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Bernstein |first= Jonathan |date= April 8, 2020 |title= Todd Snider on John Prine: 'I Couldn't Believe I Knew Him'|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/todd-snider-remembers-john-prine-980532/ |magazine= Rolling Stone |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

In 1992, Sykes helped Snider land a development deal with [[Capitol Records]]. He recorded a number of sides in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] for the label,<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y'Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> but they declined to pick up his option for a full album.<ref>{{cite book |last= Leaver |first= Jack |date= 1997 |title= All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings |chapter= ToddSnider |publisher= Backbeat |page= 432 |isbn= 9780879304751}}</ref>

Around the time of the Capitol deal, Snider began performing with a small band backing him which he dubbed the Bootleggers.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The band's lineup fluctuated some over the first year or so, but by the end of 1994, the lineup was set with [[Will Kimbrough]] on guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, and Joe McLeary on drums. Snider also had changed the band's name to the Nervous Wrecks.

Sykes was a one-time member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]’s [[Coral Reefer Band]] and Buffett had recorded a few of his songs, so when the Capitol deal fell through, he reached out on Snider's behalf to Buffett's label, Margaritaville Records, which was distributed by [[MCA Records|MCA]]. Not long after label exec Bob Mercer saw Snider perform at an industry showcase in Memphis in April 1993, Snider flew to California to open a show for Buffett. After seeing his set, Buffett offered Snider a deal with Margaritaville.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 268 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

==Recordings==
===1990s===
====Margaritaville/MCA years====
Snider's debut album for Margaritaville, ''[[Songs for the Daily Planet]]'', was released in 1994 and reached number 23 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= February 4, 1995 |title= Heatseekers Albums |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-02-04-Billboard-Page-0026.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 26 |access-date= July 26, 2011}}</ref> Produced by [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Mike Utley]], the album was literally composed of songs he was playing at the Daily Planet nightclub in Memphis. Although there were a few guest musicians and singers on the record, the core lineup was Snider on acoustic guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, Joe McLeary on drums, Utley on keys, Eddie Shaver on electric guitar, and Peter Hyrka on mandolin, acoustic guitar, and violin.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Songs-For-The-Daily-Planet/release/1906404 |title= Todd Snider – Songs for the Daily Planet |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The record included a hidden track, "Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues," which became a minor radio hit, reaching No. 31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Album Rock Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= January 7, 1995 |title= AlbumRock Tracks |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-01-07-Billboard-Page-0097.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 103 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> A talking blues for Gen-X, the song mocked the early ’90s grunge scene and featured a band that refused to play.

Snider's second album for Margaritaville/MCA, ''Step Right Up'', was released on April 23, 1996, and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' proclaimed it "more stunning than his debut."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Borzillo |first= Carrie|date= May 4, 1996 |title= Stepping Up |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9gsEAAAAMBAJ&dq=todd+snider+%22step+right+up%22&pg=PA20|magazine= Billboard |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]] were coproducers with Snider, and Utley backed Snider and the Wrecks on keyboards.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/step-right-up-mw0000186371/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Step Right Up'': Credits |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= AllMusic |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's third album, ''Viva Satellite'', represented a turning point in his career. Prior to making the record, Margaritaville left MCA and signed with Island Records for distribution. But MCA retained rights to Snider's recordings, so they would release the album. No longer recording for Margaritaville or working with [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]], Snider produced some sides at engineer Justin Niebank's studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with mixed success. Only one of the tracks he cut there would make the album, the finale "Doublewide Blues." Snider recorded the rest of the album at Ardent Studios in Memphis with producer-engineer John Hampton. He was backed by [[Will Kimbrough|Kimbrough]] on guitar, Mariencheck on bass, [[Paul Buchignani]] on drums, and Rick Steff on keys, and the result was a more straight-ahead rock record than his first two.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Viva-Satellite/release/4832355 |title= Todd Snider –Viva Satellite |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> Shortly before the album was released in May 1998, there was trouble at a private performance in L.A. for MCA execs and their staffs. Snider, who was struggling with drugs at the time, insulted those in attendance early in the set and then left the stage. Not long thereafter, MCA released him from his contract.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

===2000s===
====Oh Boy years====
After leaving MCA, Snider disbanded the Nervous Wrecks and signed with [[John Prine]]’s independent label, [[Oh Boy Records]]. Oh Boy released his fourth album, ''Happy To Be Here'', on April 18, 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= April 10, 2000 |title= Upcoming Releases |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XNPgrOvoqUkC&dq=todd+snider+happy+to+be+here&pg=PA37 |journal= CMJ New Music Report |pages= 37 |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Working with producer [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]], Snider recorded all the songs solo acoustic, then additional instrumentation was added to his guitar and vocal tracks.<ref>{{cite news |last= Lang |first= George |date= September 21, 2001 |title= Grunge survivor Todd Snider happy to be in the music business |url= https://www.oklahoman.com/article/2755931/grunge-survivor-todd-snider-happy-to-be-in-music-business |newspaper= The Oklahoman  |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Besides Kennedy who played a variety of instruments on the record, guitarists [[Pat Buchanan (musician)|Pat Buchanan]] and [[Will Kimbrough]], bassists [[Joey Spampinato]] and Keith Christopher, keyboardist [[Johnny Neel]], drummer [[Paul Buchignani]], multi-instrumentalist [[Peter Holsapple]], violinist [[Tammy Rogers]], and horn men Jim Hoke and [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] all contributed to the album.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Happy-To-Be-Here/release/4899891 |title= Todd Snider – Happy To Be Here |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Oh Boy released Snider's second album for the label, ''[[New Connection]]'', on May 14, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://toddsnider.bandcamp.com/album/new-connection|title= Todd Snider |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= BandCamp |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Produced by R.S.

Prior to the song's release on ''New Connection'', [[Garth Brooks]] released a duet with [[George Jones]] in November 2001 that had the same title and same primary lyrical hook. Snider's manager wondered whether the song Brooks and Jones recorded infringed on his song of the same name, but ultimately it was concluded that while similar, their song had been written independently of Snider's.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/what-todd-snider-really-thinks-about-garth-brooks/ |title= What Todd Snider Really Thinks About Garth Brooks |last= Trigger |date= May 11, 2014 |website= SavingCountryMusic.com |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's third Oh Boy release was a live album, ''Near Truths and Hotel Rooms'', which was released on May 13, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/near-truths-and-hotel-rooms-live-mw0000030777 |title= Todd Snider – ''Near Truths and Hotel Rooms'' |last= Ruhlman |first= William |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> The record, which was recorded at half a dozen venues, captured Snider's live show post-Nervous Wrecks — just him solo with his acoustic guitar and harmonica.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Whepley |first=  Brian |date= June 3, 2003 |title= Todd Snider - Near Truths And Hotel Rooms |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/todd-snider/todd-snider-near-truths-and-hotel-rooms/|journal= Paste |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A− grade in his Consumer Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider|title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 3, 2021 }}</ref>

Snider's final studio album for Oh Boy, ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', was released on July 20, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/east-nashville-skyline-mw0000656524 |title= Todd Snider – ''East Nashville Skyline'' |last= Latham |first= Aaron |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> For the first time, Snider took full creative control of his record-making process,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sanders |first= Daryl |date= March 2011 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville's Ambassador to the World |url= https://www.theeastnashvillian.com/todd-snider/ |journal= The East Nashvillian |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> and the result was an album that was both a musical and cultural breakthrough.

In addition to guitarist Kimbrough and multi-instrumentalist McCullough, he was backed on the sessions by a who's who of East Nashville musicians, including guitarist Tim Carroll, bassists Dave Jacques and Dave Roe, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, and pianist John Deadrick. ''East Nashville Skyline'' included two iconic songs that added to the songwriting canon: "Play a Train Song" pushed the boundaries of "train" songs with the story of a man who was known for always requesting that kind of song, and "The Ballad of the Kingsmen" took the talking blues to a more contemporary place musically while connecting the censorship of "[[Louie Louie]]" culturally to the Columbine shootings.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-East-Nashville-Skyline/release/2657758 |title= Todd Snider –East NashvilleSkyline |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' called the album "the wittiest and feistiest album of his career."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Deusner |first= Stephen M. |date= December 14, 2004 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville Skyline |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7797-east-nashville-skyline/ |journal= Pitchfork |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it "a slacker wakeup call."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider|title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 }}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' ranked it the seventh-best album of 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/best2004-041228-gilstrap-2496022811.html |title= Best of 2004 |last= Gilstrap |first= Andrew |date= December 28, 2004 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''East Nashville Skyline'' reached No. 28 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= August 7, 2004 |title= Top Independent Albums |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5BIEAAAAMBAJ&dq=east+nashville+skyline%2C+todd+snider&pg=PA61 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 61 |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref>

After ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', Snider moved to Bob Mercer's New Door Records label which was distributed by [[Universal Music Group]], but Oh Boy would issue one more album of his music. On April 3, 2007, the label released ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'', a compilation of previously unreleased recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-love-and-anarchy-rarities-b-sides-and-demos-vol-1-mw0000747312 |title= Todd Snider – ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'' |last= Deming |first= Mark |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> Notable among the collection's fourteen tracks is the song "East Nashville Skyline" which was intended to be the title track of the album of the same name but Snider did not finish it in time to make the album.

====New Door years====
While Snider was working on his first record for New Door, UMG issued a selection of his Margaritaville and MCA back catalog. The collection, ''That Was Me: 1994-1998'', was released on August 30, 2005,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/that-was-me-the-best-of-todd-snider-1994-1998-mw0000417484 |title= Todd Snider – ''That Was Me: The Best of Todd Snider 1994-1998'' |last= Monger |first= James Christopher |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> through their reissue arm, Hip-O Records.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-That-Was-Me-1994-1998/release/2126555 |title= Todd Snider – That Was Me: 1994-1998 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 10, 2021}}</ref> The compilation included seventeen tracks from all three of the albums distributed by MCA, including "Alright Guy" and "Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues," plus a previously unreleased cover of "Margaritaville, a breakneck rendition on which he was backed by the Nervous Wrecks.

Snider's first release for New Door was ''The Devil You Know'', the acclaimed follow-up to ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'' released on August 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-devil-you-know-mw0000571780 |title= Todd Snider – ''The Devil You Know'' |last= Ruhlman |first= William |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> Working again with co-producers [[Will Kimbrough]] and Eric McConnell, who both played multiple instruments on the album, Snider also was backed on the record by guitarist [[Tommy Womack]], bassists Billy Mercer, Robert Kearns, and Dave Jacques, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, pianist [[Dave Zollo]], violinist Molly Thomas, and legendary steel guitarist [[Lloyd Green]].<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-The-Devil-You-Know/release/4186777 |title= Todd Snider – The Devil You Know |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 10, 2021}}</ref> The record went to number four on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= August 25, 2006 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it "better" than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider |title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 13, 2021 }}</ref> The record was named to several critics' year-end "best" lists, including a number 33 ranking in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s top 50 albums of the year,{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}} a number 25 ranking by ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' magazine, and number 14 by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine.

On October 20, 2006, Snider made a solo acoustic in-store appearance at Grimey's New and Preloved Records in Nashville, performing material from ''The Devil You Know''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Live-At-Grimeys-Nashville/release/2444867 |title= Todd Snider – Live With The Devil You Know At Grimey's Nashville 10.20.06 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> The performance was recorded and released by New Door on April 3, 2007, as ''Live With The Devil You Know At Grimey's Nashville 10.20.06''. It was his final release on the New Door label.

====Launch of Aimless Records====
In 2008, Snider launched his own independent record label, Aimless Records. The label's first release was his eight-song EP ''[[Peace Queer]]'', the most political record of his career. The title was inspired by the ’60s avant garde rock band [[The Fugs]] who had a line about killing "peace queers."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jambase.com/article/todd-snider-is-so-queer |title= Todd Snider Is So Queer |last= Cook |first= Dennis |date= October 23, 2008 |website= Jambase |publisher= |access-date= August 13, 2021 }}</ref> As Snider tells it in the press bio for the album, he was kidnapped by an international league of peace queers who forced him to write the protest songs that appeared on the record. Three of the tracks on the EP were recorded at co-producer Eric McConnell's studio with backing from some of the musicians who worked on Snider's two previous albums, including guitarist [[Will Kimbrough]], bassist Dave Jacques, keyboardist [[Dave Zollo]], and drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright. The remainder of the EP was recorded with co-producer [[Doug Lancio]] at his studio with Lancio providing musical accompaniment and [[Patty Griffin]] contributing backing vocals to two of the tracks — "Cape Henry" and the cover of John Fogerty's "[[Fortunate Son]]." Released on October 14, 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-queer-mw0000795517/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Peace Queer'': Credits |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> the record went to number one on the Americana Airplay Chart and number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= October 31, 2008 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

====Yep Roc album====
Aimless did not release Snider's next album, ''[[The Excitement Plan]]'', because he had already committed it to Yep Roc Records, but it would be the last record he would make for another record label. Produced by [[Don Was]] and released on June 9, 2009, the album featured Snider with minimal backing: Was on upright bass, [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, and [[Greg Leisz]] on dobro and pedal steel.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-excitement-plan-mw0000817699/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''The Excitement Plan'': Credits  |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''PopMatters'' called the record "a masterwork of intimacy" and said it "solidified his place among the masters of the form."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/94859-todd-snider-the-excitement-plan-2496036027.html |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |last= Henderson |first= Stuart |date= June 16, 2009 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> The Associated Press called it "the finest album of his career."<ref>{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Music Review: Snider finds humor in tough times |url= https://www.deseret.com/2009/6/8/20322379/music-review-snider-finds-humor-in-tough-times |newspaper= Deseret News |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave it four stars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Hermes |first= Will |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/27999157/review/28565381/the_excitement_plan |magazine= Rolling Stone |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613014403/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/27999157/review/28565381/the_excitement_plan |access-date= August 13, 2021|archive-date= June 13, 2009 }}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it a B+ in his Consumer Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider |title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 }}</ref> The album went to number six on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> and number 31 on the magazine's Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/ind/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Independent Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

===2010s===
====Aimless label years====

'''Uncle Tupelo''' was an [[alternative country]] music group from [[Belleville, Illinois]], active between 1987 and 1994. [[Jay Farrar]], [[Jeff Tweedy]], and [[Mike Heidorn]] formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with [[Sire Records]] and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'', Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed [[Son Volt]] with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as [[Wilco]].

Although Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/|title=American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk|last=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|access-date=May 31, 2006|website=[[AllMusic]]|archive-date=November 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113053923/http://allmusic.com/explore/essay|url-status=dead}}</ref> The group's first album, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the [[hardcore punk]] of [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]] and the country instrumentation and harmony of the [[Carter Family]] and [[Hank Williams]]. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]] and the [[working class]] of Belleville.

== History ==

=== The Plebes and The Primitives ===
[[Jay Farrar]], along with his brothers Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=10}} Hailing from [[Belleville, Illinois]], The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited [[Jeff Tweedy]], a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=17}} Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a [[rockabilly]] style, Tweedy wanted to play [[punk rock]] like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}

Before leaving the band in 1984, Dade Farrar introduced its members to [[Mike Heidorn]], the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}<ref name="liner" /> The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}<ref>The band was also known as "The Primatives" due to a misprint on their business cards</ref> Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the [[St. Louis]] area, The Primitives began to play [[blues]]-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in [[Millstadt, Illinois]], where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee.<ref name="liner" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=19}} They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to [[Southern Illinois University]] and an attempted enlistment in the [[United States Army]] meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=22}} The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece.<ref name="liner" /> To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named [[The Primitives]], they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo.<ref name="PopM" /> Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.<ref name="PD" />

=== As Uncle Tupelo ===
[[File:Uncle Tupelo poster.png|thumb|left|An early poster for an Uncle Tupelo show, in the style of Chuck Wagner's original drawing]]
The Primitives renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo, a name  created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary. Inspired by the name, cartoonist Chuck Wagner, a friend of the band, created a character resembling an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="liner" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=23}} The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which got them supporting slots opening for headline artists such as [[Johnny Thunders]] and [[Warren Zevon]].<ref name="liner" /> Tweedy met Tony Margherita while working as a clerk at Euclid Records in St. Louis. After attending two of the band's shows, Margherita offered to become their manager.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=25–26}} Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero's Basement — a bar close to the campus of [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. Bands playing in a similar style, including [[Brian Henneman]]'s group Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered the locus of a new music scene.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=29–30}} The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.<ref name="liner" />

Uncle Tupelo recorded demo tracks in the attic studio of future Chicago punk producer Matt Allison in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. The demo, distributed with the title ''Not Forever, Just for Now'', includes "I Got Drunk" and "Screen Door", as well as early versions of several other songs that would appear on the band's first studio album.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=38}} The ''[[College Media Journal|CMJ New Music Report]]'' gave the tape a rave review, and called Uncle Tupelo the best unsigned band of the year. The accolade drew the attention of independent labels, and the band decided to sign with Jay Fialkov and Debbie Southwood-Smith of [[Giant Records (independent label)|Giant Records]], who offered to book them at [[CBGB]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pick|first=Steve|title=Uncle Tupelo: From Belleville to Rockville|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=July 5, 1990}}</ref> Explaining the decision, the band said that "[our] original goals don't get distorted with an independent label."<ref>{{cite news|last=Toroian|first=Diane|url=http://www.factorybelt.net/articles/giant.jpg|title=Uncle Tupelo Taking Giant Step|work=[[St. Louis Sun|The Sun]]|date=November 1989}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref>

=== Recordings on Rockville Records ===
{{Listen|filename=UTFactoryBelt.ogg|title="Factory Belt"|description=The fifth track on ''No Depression'', sung by Jay Farrar. This song exemplifies the band's start–stop song technique, which was influenced by [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]].|filename2=UTAtomicPower.ogg|title2="Atomic Power"|description2=The tenth track on ''March 16–20, 1992'', sung by Farrar. Originally a [[Louvin Brothers]] song, [[Peter Buck]] approached the band after hearing Uncle Tupelo's version of this song performed live. It is an exemplar of the acoustic recordings found on ''March''.}}
Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records changed its name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', was recorded over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] [[military draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|title=Uncle Tupelo Offers Varying Takes on Small-town Life|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=January 23, 1991}}</ref> Impressed by their previous work on [[Dinosaur Jr.]]'s ''[[Bug (Dinosaur Jr album)|Bug]]'', the band wanted [[Paul Kolderie]] and [[Sean Slade]] to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 [[Gibson Les Paul Junior|Gibson Les Paul SG Junior]] that [[J. Mascis]] originally played on ''Bug''.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=41–44}} The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.

In between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn formed a country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later a member of [[The Bottle Rockets]]). Henneman impressed Uncle Tupelo, and he was invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=48–49}} While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=51–53}}

By March 1991, ''No Depression'' had sold an estimated 15,000 copies, and was featured in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article about rising stars.<ref name="liner" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=52}} However, Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album, a theme that would continue for the remainder of the band's contract.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=52}} Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at [[Long View Farm]] in rural [[North Brookfield, Massachusetts]]. ''[[Still Feel Gone]]'', with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and [[Gary Louris]] of [[The Jayhawks]]. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=58}} Soon afterward, Uncle Tupelo recorded "Shaking Hands (Soldier's Joy)" on [[Michelle Shocked]]'s album ''[[Arkansas Traveler (Michelle Shocked album)|Arkansas Traveler]]'' and joined her on the accompanying tour with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[The Band]]. However, the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Band.<ref name="last" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Morse|first=Steve|title=Shocked's Show Goes on, Despite Disputes|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=October 8, 1992}}</ref><ref name="CST" />

[[Alternative rock]] had broken into the mainstream by 1992, and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a major-label record deal. However, Uncle Tupelo did not want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and decided to play [[country music|country]] and [[folk song]]s "as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene".{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=59–60}}{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=66}} [[Peter Buck]], guitarist for [[R.E.M.]], saw the trio perform at the [[40 Watt Club]] in [[Athens, Georgia]] and sought them out after the show. Buck was impressed with a version of "Atomic Power" that the band played, and offered his services for their next album. Over a span of five days, Buck produced the group's next album, ''[[March 16–20, 1992]]''.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=61}} Buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions, and charged no money for his services. Henneman's role was increased for this album, and he taught himself how to play [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]].{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=63}} Despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock, major labels began to show significant interest in Uncle Tupelo after ''March 16–20, 1992'' was released.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=66}} The album sold more than their two previous recordings combined, although Rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rock.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eichenberger|first=Bill|title=Life's All Right; Uncle Tupelo Kicks Back, Adds Acoustic Touch and Sings Great Songs|work=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=March 1, 1994}}</ref>

=== Major label contract ===
In 1992, Joe McEwen of [[Sire Records]] began to pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr. and [[Shawn Colvin]] to Sire, had been interested in them since hearing the ''Not Forever, Just for Now'' demo tape. At the urging of [[Gary Louris]], McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums and specified a budget of $150,000 for the first.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=71–73}}

Around the time of the recording of ''March 16–20, 1992'', Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.<ref name="CST" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=69}}

The band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for ''March 16–20, 1992'', and two candidates stood out: Bill Belzer and [[Ken Coomer]]. Although Farrar and Tweedy agreed that Coomer was the better drummer, they were intimidated by his six-foot-four stature and long [[dreadlocks]]. The band instead selected Belzer as Heidorn's replacement, but he only stayed with the band for six months.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=73}} Tweedy explained Belzer's departure:{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=74}}

<blockquote>I want to believe it was purely musical, and I honestly believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a [[gay]] person at that point in our lives&nbsp;... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.</blockquote>

After touring Europe opening for [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]], the band replaced Belzer with Coomer. The band also experimented with new members: [[John Stirratt]] replaced Brian Henneman (who left to form The Bottle Rockets) while [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]], the brother of Michelle Shocked, joined as a live mandolin and [[violin]] performer. Stirratt became the full-time bassist, allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=75}}

Now a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo recorded their major label debut at Cedar Creek studio in [[Austin, Texas]] in early 1993. ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'' consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included a duet with Farrar and [[Doug Sahm]] of the [[Sir Douglas Quintet]].{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=78}} The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=79–80}}<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 10, 1993}}</ref> The group toured until the end of the year, finishing with a sold-out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire began to see the band as a potential hit.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=79–80}}

In 1993, the band contributed a cover of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s track "Effigy" to the AIDS-Benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

=== Breakup ===
With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of ''Anodyne'', Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled:{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=77}}

<blockquote>Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, "Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again." He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore.</blockquote>

Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Llewellyn|first=Kati|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/35152-jay-farrar-speaks-extensively-about-uncle-tupelos-breakup |title=Jay Farrar Speaks Extensively About Uncle Tupelo's Breakup|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=September 8, 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308083824/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/35152-jay-farrar-speaks-extensively-about-uncle-tupelos-breakup |archive-date = March 8, 2008}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref> In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and did not want to work with Tweedy anymore.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=81–82}} Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: "It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record."<ref>{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html|title=Jay Farrar Traces a Path Away from Uncle Tupelo|work=[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]|date=Fall 1995|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070326024357/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html |archive-date = March 26, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref>

Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, rather than directly from Farrar. The following day, the two engaged in a verbal confrontation.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=82–83}} As a favor to Margherita, who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running, Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=82–83}} The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Sire had requested that the band perform "The Long Cut" on the show, which further irked Farrar since the song was written and sung by Tweedy.

Uncle Tupelo's last concerts, two shows at [[The Blue Note (Columbia, Missouri)|The Blue Note]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]] and two shows at [[Mississippi Nights]] in [[St. Louis]], took place from April 28 to May 1, 1994. A special "last leg" poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as "St. Louis's 4th best country band", based on a readers' poll in the [[Riverfront Times]]. On the last night, Tweedy and Farrar each performed nine songs during the concert, and Mike Heidorn performed as drummer during the encore.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=84−85}}

=== Post-breakup ===
{{further|Son Volt|Wilco}}
Following Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created [[Wilco]]. They began rehearsing a few days after the final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]''. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, [[Son Volt]]; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with [[Joe Henry]] as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album ''[[Trace (Son Volt album)|Trace]]'' in November 1994.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=89–90}}

Wilco signed to [[Reprise Records]] while Son Volt signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Son Volt had an early [[college rock]] hit with "Drown" from the album ''Trace'', but Wilco maintained a more commercially successful career in the years to follow.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|magazine=Billboard|date=April 13, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052800/wilco-in-the-comfort-zone|title=Wilco: In the Comfort Zone|magazine=Billboard|date=April 13, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622183009/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052800/wilco-in-the-comfort-zone |archive-date = June 22, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref> Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that "nothing's ever for sure, but I would have to say, 'No such thing'."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dechert|first=S.

Farrar and Tweedy sued Rockville Records and Dutch East India Trading CEO Barry Tenenbaum in 2000 over royalties that the label allegedly owed them, winning restitution from Tenenbaum and the joint rights to Uncle Tupelo's first three albums. After securing the rights, the band released a compilation entitled ''[[89/93: An Anthology]]''. In 2003, Uncle Tupelo re-issued their first three albums, which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200,000 copies.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=72}}

== Influences ==
As The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as [[The Ramones]] and [[The Sex Pistols]]. However, they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St. Louis music scenes. While they originally were introduced to country by their parents, it was not until this time that they began to listen to it for leisure.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=19}}<ref name="NYT" /> Farrar typically wrote songs about [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]], while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships. Farrar took influence from authors such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[Jack Kerouac]], whom he read while working at his mother's bookstore.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ganahl|first=Jane|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/02/20/DDGUV53HRP1.DTL|title=Profile: Jay Farrar|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=February 20, 2004}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref> As a singer, Farrar's lyrics would be front-and-center during performances, but the band's musical style was mostly driven by Tweedy and Heidorn.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=36–37}} Jeff Tweedy said in an interview with the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'':<ref name="PD" />

<blockquote>We probably have more influences than we know what to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as [[Hank Williams]]... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.</blockquote>

Tweedy in particular was inspired by the Minutemen, and wrote a song about [[D. Boon]] following Boon's death in a van accident.<ref>Tweedy, Jeff. Lyrics. "D. Boon." ''[[Still Feel Gone]]''.

<blockquote>It's strange to hear Uncle Tupelo mentioned because what we were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.</blockquote>

The band's first three albums influenced contemporary roots rock artists such as [[Richmond Fontaine]] and [[Whiskeytown]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Johnathan P.|url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2003/04/29/Entertainment/Sound.Bites-494510.shtml|title=Sound Bites|work=[[The Daily Texan]]|date=April 29, 2003|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930220801/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2003/04/29/Entertainment/Sound.Bites-494510.shtml |archive-date = September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mervis|first=Scott|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05132/502797.stm|title=Music Preview: Ever-prolific Ryan Adams eases down the road with Dead-like 'Roses'|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=May 12, 2005}} Last accessed June 8, 2007</ref> Uncle Tupelo's usage of distorted guitars to play a style of music that was known for its earnestness became a lasting trend in 1990s modern rock.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Moon|first=Tom|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/uncletupelo/albums/album/236800/review/6067942/anodyne|title=Uncle Tupelo: Anodyne (review)|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 1, 2003|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091720/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/uncletupelo/albums/album/236800/review/6067942/anodyne |archive-date = October 1, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref> Jason Ankeny wrote in [[AllMusic]] that:<ref name="am">{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=Uncle Tupelo {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/uncle-tupelo-mn0000222927/biography|access-date=May 29, 2007|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

'''Thomas Wayne Hancock III''' (born May 1, 1965, in Dallas, Texas) better known as Wayne "The Train" Hancock, is an American singer-songwriter. Known as "The King of Juke Joint Swing,"{{cn|date=July 2023}} his performances incorporate [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[western swing]], [[Country music|country]] and [[rockabilly]], styles of music that he began listening to as a kid. His influences include [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[Hank Snow]] because they were all in his parents' record collection.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://turnstyledjunkpiled.com/2018/10/31/waynethetrain/|title=Wayne 'The Train' Hancock: Man of the Road|work=TJ Music Magazine|access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref>

Throughout his childhood, Hancock moved around seven times because his father was a [[Design engineer]] who worked at various engineering firms around the United States. Shortly after discovering [[country music]], Hancock began writing songs at the age of twelve. Hancock's vocal style was initially influenced by [[Hank Williams]], and he has been compared to him throughout his career.<ref name=":0" />

At eighteen years old, Hancock won the Wrangler [[Country Showdown]] contest. The son of a [[WWII]] veteran, Hancock joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] immediately after winning the contest and was shipped to [[recruit training]]. Hancock served in the military for four years. During a six-month deployment at [[Camp Hansen]] in [[Okinawa, Japan]], he wrote one of his most well known songs, "Cold Lonesome Wind" from ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]''.<ref name=":0" />

In 1990, Hancock moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. In 1994, he met [[Lubbock, Texas]] native [[Joe Ely]], a member of the [[The Flatlanders|Flatlanders]] at the [[Continental Club]] in, Austin, Texas. Shortly thereafter, Hancock landed a role in [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]] and [[Jo Harvey Allen]]'s play, [[Chippy (album)|Chippy]]. [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] of the Flatlanders originally played Hancock's character Mr. Jukebox. When Gilmore was unable to do the second run of the play, Ely brought Hancock in, saying "This guy sounds just like [[Hank Williams]], he'd be perfect." From there, Hancock joined the cast and went into the studio to record "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs," for the soundtrack. It was his first recording of the song.<ref name=":0" />

Hancock met [[Grammy Award]] winning producer, [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] player, and [[Lubbock, Texas]] native, [[Lloyd Maines]] when Maines was running sound for [[Chippy (album)|Chippy]]. [[Lloyd Maines|Maines]] has produced all of Hancock's albums, dating back to his 1995 debut, ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]'', released on Deja Disc Records. The album sold 22,000 copies in the first year. The follow-up was Hancock's sophomore 1997 album, ''[[That's What Daddy Wants]]'' released on [[Ark 21]]. Hancock gained the nickname The Train because of his marathon length shows, going on for 3, 4, even 5 hours long."

On his debut 1999 album, ''[[Risin' Outlaw]]'', [[Hank Williams III]], grandson of [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams Sr.]], covered two songs from ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]'', the title track, and "Why Don't You Leave Me Alone." He also recorded "87 Southbound," from ''[[That's What Daddy Wants]]''.<ref name=":0" />

In April 2014, Hancock was involved in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him with a fractured elbow and a collapsed lung. He was forced to cancel several months' worth of tour dates due to the wreck, but by the end of the year he was fully recovered and back on the road. In 2016, Hancock returned to the studio with producer [[Lloyd Maines]] to cut his eighth studio album Slingin' Rhythm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wayne-hancock-mn0000243418/biography|title=Wayne Hancock {{!}} Biography & History|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=July 3, 2019}}</ref>

'''Whiskeytown''' was an American [[alternative country]] band formed in 1994 from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. Fronted by [[Ryan Adams]], the group included members [[Caitlin Cary]], [[Phil Wandscher]], Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, and [[Mike Daly]]. They disbanded in 2000 with Adams leaving to pursue his solo career. Whiskeytown gradually expanded its sound outside the confines of alternative country while still maintaining its alternative roots.

The band released three albums. No two albums shared a consistent lineup; Adams and Cary remained the only constants.

== History ==
After performing punk rock with a band called The Patty Duke Syndrome, Adams founded Whiskeytown in 1994 in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. The music of country-rock artist [[Gram Parsons]] served as his inspiration. The band initially consisted of Adams, violinist [[Caitlin Cary]], drummer Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, bassist Steve Grothmann and guitarist [[Phil Wandscher]].<ref name=Guardian2001>{{cite news |title='I'm not a star to myself. I just make records.' |first=Adam |last=Sweeting |date=September 19, 2001 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/sep/19/artsfeatures.ryanadams }}</ref>

=== ''Faithless Street'' era (1995–1996) ===
''[[Faithless Street]]'', released on Mood Food Records in 1995, established the band as one of the genre's leaders, thanks to glowing reviews in publications such as ''[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]'', and helped the band score a major-label record deal with the [[Geffen Records]] imprint Outpost.

''Faithless'' was re-released on the imprint in 1998 with nearly a dozen bonus tracks from the era. Among the bonus tracks were previously unreleased tracks and tracks that had been released on earlier albums and EPs, including ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'' and ''[[Rural Free Delivery (EP)|Rural Free Delivery]]''. One track, "Oklahoma," was removed. Adams claimed that the reason for the re-release was the muddy sound of the original version and his distaste for "Oklahoma," which was added to the album despite his objections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435210/09011998/whiskeytown.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040521063536/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435210/09011998/whiskeytown.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 21, 2004 |title=News – Articles – 1435210 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=September 1, 1998 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

=== ''Strangers Almanac'' era (1997–1998) ===
Whiskeytown's 1997 major-label debut, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', helped to establish Adams' reputation as a songwriter. In the midst of the album's recording, Gilmore and Grothman left, and Wandscher left soon after the album's release. The band cycled through numerous members throughout the next year, including [[Jeff Rice]] and Steven Terry, both of whom were involved in the recording of ''Almanac'' but left later that year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The band's reputation preceded it in the live setting. In a 1997 ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' article titled Whiskeytown: half band, half soap opera, a June 1997 show at Mac's Bar in [[Lansing, Michigan]] was described by fans as a half-baked performance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McCollum |first=Brian |date=October 24, 1997 |title=Whiskeytown: half band, half soap opera |url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/1997%20Shows/1997.10.25.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203081214/http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/1997%20Shows/1997.10.25.htm |archive-date=February 3, 2011 |access-date=November 14, 2023 |website=answeringbell.com}}</ref>

Despite the band's internal strife, ''Almanac'' was a successful album with critics, with the tracks "16 Days" and the Replacements-esque "Yesterday's News" receiving significant radio play. The positive reviews came from increasingly mainstream publications such as ''Rolling Stone'', who claimed at the time, ''"If there's to be a [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] among the bands that are imprecisely dubbed alternative country, look to Whiskeytown."''<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whiskeytown/albums/album/100139/review/5940837/strangers_almanac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118110424/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whiskeytown/albums/album/100139/review/5940837/strangers_almanac|date=November 18, 2007}}</ref>  In January 1998, the band taped a live performance for ''[[Austin City Limits]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/1998%20Shows/1998.01.26.htm |title=01/26/98 |publisher=Answeringbell.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

During the tour for ''[[Stranger's Almanac]]'', most of the band was fired or quit at a concert in Kansas City. The only people who started and finished the tour were Adams, [[Caitlin Cary]], [[Mike Daly]] and tour manager [[Thomas O'Keefe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2001/12/01/ryan-adams-saving-private-ryan/ |title=Ryan Adams: Saving Private Ryan |publisher=Magnetmagazine.com |date=December 1, 2001 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

=== ''Pneumonia'' and the band's demise (1999–2001) ===
The band managed to add a new core member in multi-instrumentalist [[Mike Daly]], who contributed significantly to the band's sound on their third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]]''.

The album's recording was a much different affair from the first two—likely because of the band's constantly changing dynamic. The traditional country of the first two albums, especially ''Faithless'', was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop sound, very similar to [[Wilco]]'s 1999 album ''[[Summerteeth]]''. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]]' [[Tommy Stinson]] and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' [[James Iha]].

Despite the album's completion and Whiskeytown's sizable fanbase, Outpost Records closed during the merger between Polygram and Universal, and as a result the album stayed in limbo for nearly two years, effectively ending the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2000-12-21/music/swan-song/2|title=Swan Song – Page 2 – Music – Phoenix – Phoenix New Times|first=Bill|last= Holdship|date=December 21, 2000|access-date=January 3, 2011|publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]]}}</ref>

[[Lost Highway Records]], the roots-minded label imprint of [[Universal Music]], picked up the album after signing Adams (who, in the interim, recorded his highly acclaimed debut solo record ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' on indie label [[Bloodshot Records]]) and released it in May 2001 [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r532907|pure_url=yes}}].

=== Post-Whiskeytown and talk of reunion ===
Since the band dissolved, most core members have chosen to remain active in music. Cary, who married original drummer Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, has released three solo albums and created a female folk trio named [[Tres Chicas]].<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5935412/cary_strikes_up_tres_chicas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002100552/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5935412/cary_strikes_up_tres_chicas|date=October 2, 2007}}</ref> In 2010 she formed a duo group called The Small Ponds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmallponds.com/home.cfm |title=Home |publisher=The Small Ponds |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> with Matt Douglas of Raleigh band The Proclivities. In 2013, Cary and solo artist [[Jon Lindsay (musician)|Jon Lindsay]] co-founded the [http://www.ncmusiclovearmy.org/ NC Music Love Army] – a collective of many notable musicians from North Carolina who oppose the leadership of the newly emerged Republican supermajority in their home state. Between 2013 and 2014, the group has put out nine releases on their own label (Love Army Records), as well as thru [[Redeye Distribution]] and [[Bloodshot Records]].

Adams has remained in the spotlight since the band's breakup, releasing numerous solo albums, including three in 2005. In 2004, Adams founded [[Ryan Adams and The Cardinals]], an alternative rock band. The band released several albums before disbanding in 2009.<ref name=RollStone2008>{{cite magazine |title=Ryan Adams and the Cardinals |date=October 28, 2008 |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/23181054/page/29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922234353/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/23181054/page/29 |archive-date=September 22, 2008 }}</ref> He has drawn considerable praise from such legends as [[Elton John]] and [[Phil Lesh]] for his songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449631/20011004/john_elton.jhtml?headlines=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005182343/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449631/20011004/john_elton.jhtml?headlines=true |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 5, 2001 |title=Elton John Bags Technology; Praises Eminem, Ryan Adams – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=October 5, 2001 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>  In February 2001, original Whiskeytown guitarist [[Phil Wandscher]] joined Adams at a Seattle show to perform two songs.  It was the first time the two had appeared onstage together in 3½ years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/2001%20Shows/2001.02.13.htm |title=02/13/01 |publisher=Answeringbell.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

Adams and Cary have claimed to be reuniting Whiskeytown on multiple occasions, as recently as 2010, but nothing new has been released yet. He told an interviewer in January 2017 that he was writing a book about the band, but had no plans to record or tour with Whiskeytown.<ref name=JamBase17>{{cite news |title=Ryan Adams Writing Book About Whiskeytown |date=January 25, 2017 |first=Andy |last=Kahn |work=JamBase |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/ryan-adams-writing-book-whiskeytown }}</ref> A scheduling conflict was blamed as the reason for the reunion not taking place. The band did reunite for a one-off, impromptu gig after one of Adams' shows in Raleigh, NC, in 2005. Gilmore, Cary, and Adams were joined on-stage by Adams' pedal steel player, Jon Graboff, and bassist [[Catherine Popper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answeringbell.com/Answering%20Bell/2005%20Shows/2005.06.08.htm |title=06/08/05 |publisher=Answeringbell.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

'''Whitey Morgan and the 78's''' are an American [[country music|country]] band based in [[Flint, Michigan]]. In 2010, they signed a recording contract with Chicago-based [[Bloodshot Records]].

== Formation and early history ==
Started in 2005, under the name Whitey Morgan and the Waycross Georgia Farmboys, the original members included Whitey Morgan (a.k.a. Eric Allen) on vocals and guitar; Jeremy Mackinder on bass; and Dylan Dunbar and Jack Schneider on guitar and drums respectively.<ref>[http://weekly.metrotimes.com/Subjects/s11078/Whitey_Morgan_and_The_Waycross_Georgia_Farmboys]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081044/http://weekly.metrotimes.com/Subjects/s11078/Whitey_Morgan_and_The_Waycross_Georgia_Farmboys |date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> After establishing themselves in the Midwest Honky Tonk scene, the band recorded a self-produced EP which includes early versions of "Goodbye Dixie," "Prove It All To You," and "If It Ain't Broke."

In 2009, the band saw the addition of Tamineh Gueramy on fiddle. The band then headed to [[Woodstock, New York]] in the fall of 2009 to begin recording the follow-up to ''Honky Tonks...'' at the Levon Helm Studios. With almost 200 shows a year and the new album nearing completion the band drew the attention of Chicago's Bloodshot Records and signed a new record contract. The self-titled album was released on October 12, 2010. Ahead of the record's release, both Benny James and Mike Popovich left the band, replaced by Travis Harrett on the drums and Brett Robinson joined on pedal steel guitar. In April 2012, Jeremy Mackinder was replaced by Joey Spina on guitar.{{cn|date=July 2015}} The album ''Grandpa's Guitar'' was released in December 2014. It features three cover tunes: [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "Highway Patrolman," "Today I Started Loving You Again" by [[Merle Haggard]] and Bonnie Owens, and "[[Dead Flowers (Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]].

'''Wilco''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[Chicago]]. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of [[alternative country]] group [[Uncle Tupelo]] after singer [[Jay Farrar]]'s departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] and bassist [[John Stirratt]] remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004 the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist [[Nels Cline]], multi-instrumentalist [[Pat Sansone]], keyboard player [[Mikael Jorgensen]], and drummer [[Glenn Kotche]]. Wilco has released thirteen studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with [[Billy Bragg]] and one with [[the Minus 5]].

Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles including [[Bill Fay]], [[the Beatles]], and [[Television (band)|Television]]; in turn the band has influenced music by many modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the [[alternative country]] style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]'' (1995), but has since introduced more [[experimental music|experimental]] aspects to their music, including elements of [[alternative rock]] and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current "eclectic [[indie rock]] collective that touches on many eras and genres".<ref>{{cite web |date=September 25, 2012 |title=Indie-Rockers Wilco Make First Appearance At The Cascade Theatre Sept 26 |url=http://anewscafe.com/2012/09/25/indie-rockers-wilco-make-first-appearance-at-the-cascade-theatre-sept-26/ |author=Press Release}}</ref>

Wilco received media attention for their fourth album, ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, [[Reprise Records]] rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming ''Foxtrot'' on its website, Wilco sold the album to [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of [[Warner Music Group]], leading a critic to say the album showed "how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|author-link=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/yankee-hotel-foxtrot-250882/|title=Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (review)|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 9, 2002|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912001355/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot |archive-date = September 12, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> The event was immortalized in the documentary [[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|''I Am Trying to Break Your Heart'']]; director [[Sam Jones (photographer)|Sam Jones]] followed the band as they wrote and produced the record. ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two [[Grammy Award]]s for their fifth studio album, 2004's ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'', including [[Best Alternative Music Album]]. Wilco released their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Cousin (album)|Cousin]]'', in September 2023.

==History==

===Formation, ''A.M.'', and ''Being There'' (1994–1996)===
{{Main|Uncle Tupelo}}
Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group [[Uncle Tupelo]]. Singer [[Jay Farrar]] quit the band in 1994 because of a soured relationship with co-singer [[Jeff Tweedy]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html|title=Jay Farrar Traces a Path Away from Uncle Tupelo|work=[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]|date=Fall 1995|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002617/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html |archive-date = September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed July 9, 2007.</ref> Both Tweedy and Farrar immediately sought to form bands after the breakup, with Farrar organizing [[Son Volt]]. Tweedy's new band included all current members of Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including [[bassist]] John Stirratt, [[drummer]] [[Ken Coomer]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]]. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist [[Brian Henneman]] of [[the Bottle Rockets]] to perform, who appears on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]''.<ref name="undertowmusic.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.undertowmusic.com/messageboards/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=3926&p=26462#p26462|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220011754/http://www.undertowmusic.com/messageboards/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=3926&p=26462#p26462|url-status=dead|title=Undertownmusic.com|archive-date=December 20, 2008}}</ref> The group considered retaining the Uncle Tupelo name<ref>{{cite news|last=Sheridan|first=Phil|title=Roger, Wilco|work=[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]|date=February 1995}}</ref> but decided to call themselves "Wilco" after the [[Military and commercial aviation radio voice acronym|military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation]] for "will comply",<ref name="Kot 2004">Kot 2004. p. 89</ref> a choice which Tweedy has said is "fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves."<ref name="CBS News Sunday Morning">Cynthia Bowers (August 23, 2009). "A Summer Song", [[CBS News Sunday Morning]]</ref>

After collaborating with [[Syd Straw]] on a cover version of the [[Ernest Tubb]] song "The T.B. is Whipping Me" (released in September 1994 on the ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' compilation produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]), Wilco began [https://web.archive.org/web/20081220011754/http://www.undertowmusic.com/messageboards/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=3926&p=26462#p26462 recording tracks] for ''[[A.M.

Although Tweedy said that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract.<ref name="Kot1">Kot 2004. p. 92</ref> Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission—John Stirratt's "It's Just That Simple"—appeared on ''A.M.''. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.<ref name="Kot1"/>

Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on ''A.M.'' was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."<ref>{{cite news|last=Cameron|first=Keith|title=Last Twang in Town|publisher=Vox|date=May 1997}}</ref> ''A.M.'' peaked at number twenty-seven on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, [[Son Volt]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 15, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|magazine=Billboard|date=October 7, 1995}}</ref> The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the ''[[Village Voice]]'''s 1995 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=George-Warren|first=Holly|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-m-187587/|title=Wilco: ''A.M.''

The song is an example of the straightforward alternative country music described by Tweedy as "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (the band was billed for the occasion as "[[Black Shampoo]]").<ref>{{cite news|last=Kuelker|first=Michael|title=New Wilco Satisfies Tupelo Fans|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|date=November 19, 1994}} Last accessed September 2, 2007.</ref> During the two hundred-date tour supporting ''A.M.'', Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 110–1</ref>

<blockquote>The whole ''[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]'' thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on "Misunderstood," where I'm playing guitar.</blockquote>

Wilco recorded a number of songs with this theme, including "Sunken Treasure" and "Hotel Arizona."<ref>Kot 2004. p. 112</ref> Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of ''A.M.''<ref name="ND">{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html|title=Being There, Doing That|publisher=No Depression|date=September 1996|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070507025218/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html |archive-date = May 7, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.</ref> Wilco named the album ''[[Being There (Wilco album)|Being There]]'' after a [[Peter Sellers]] [[Being There|film of the same name]]. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of [[Freakwater]] briefly joined the band in the studio, playing [[pedal steel guitar]] on "Far, Far Away" and "Dreamer in My Dreams", and then became an official member in September 1996.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 115</ref><ref>Kot 2004. p. 119</ref>

Unlike the ''A.M.'' recording sessions, the band had no desire to produce a hit song from their second effort.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 114</ref> The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a [[double album]] would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 116</ref> ''Being There'' was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="ND"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Deming |first=Mark |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=being-there-mw0000613155#review|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Being There'' Review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325044108/http://www.allmusic.com/album/being-there-r241294/review |title=Original review by Jason Ankeny |date=March 25, 2011}}.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/being-there-203447/|title=Being There |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 24, 1996|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070619094452/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/240156/review/5946124/being_there |archive-date = June 19, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> The album reached No. 73 on the ''Billboard'' album charts,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|magazine=Billboard|date=November 16, 1996}}</ref> a significant improvement from ''A.M.'', and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres96.php|title=The 1996 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.</ref> The album's single "Outtasite (Outta Mind)" became the group's first song to enter the ''Billboard'' charts, reaching No. 39 on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No. 22 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wilco Awards |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=wilco-mn0000254215#awards|pure_url=yes}} |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}}</ref>

===''Summerteeth'' and the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions (1997–2000)===
In November 1997, Wilco entered [[Willie Nelson]]'s recording studio in [[Spicewood]], [[Texas]] to record a third studio album.<ref name="Kot-2004">Kot 2004. p. 138</ref> The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century [[literature]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 135</ref> Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's "bold, but depressing" lyrics.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 140–1</ref> Wilco recorded several songs, including "Via Chicago" and "She's a Jar", but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.<ref name="Kot-2004"/>
[[File:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|left|thumb|The two ''Mermaid Avenue'' albums  are recordings of unreleased [[Woody Guthrie]] (''pictured'') songs]]
[[Nora Guthrie]] contacted singer-songwriter [[Billy Bragg]] in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]]. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of [[Huntington's disease]]. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a "relic" to the [[MTV generation]], and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was "the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody." Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 143</ref>

Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their ''Being There'' tour. Bragg was particularly fond of ''Being There'' because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs with one of his idols—Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]]. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a "freak weirdo." The recording of ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of [[BBC]]'s ''[[Man in the Sand]]'' documentary film.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 144–5</ref>

Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded "you make your record, and I'll make mine..." Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.

Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 151–3</ref> The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and ''Rolling Stone'', and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marcus|first=Greil|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/kicking-television-live-in-chicago-249386/|title=Mermaid Avenue |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 1, 1998|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071002102709/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/225606/review/6213088/mermaid_avenue |archive-date = October 2, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=2579&name=Billy+Bragg+%26+Wilco|title=CG: Billy Bragg & Wilco|publisher=robertchristgau.com}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres98.php|title=The 1998 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist [[Leroy Bach]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 169</ref>

After the completion of the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, ''[[Summerteeth]]''. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with [[Pro Tools]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 154–5</ref> Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 158</ref>

<blockquote>The story of ''Summerteeth'' is Jay bought a [[Mellotron]] and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness&nbsp;... It reminds me of ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.</blockquote>

During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with [[Time Inc.]]<ref>Kot 2004. p. 161</ref> As a result, Warner's [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, [[Howie Klein]], who had previously authorized the release of ''Being There'' as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce ''Summerteeth'' without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this "once and once only" and recorded a radio-friendly version of "Can't Stand It" at the request of [[David Kahne]], the head of the A&R department.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 162–5</ref> The single version of "Can't Stand It" failed to cross over from [[Adult album alternative|Triple-A]] radio to alternative rock stations. The album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than ''Being There''<ref>Kot 2004. p. 167</ref> despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres99.php|title=The 1999 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 15, 2007.</ref>

After the release of ''[[Summerteeth]]'', the band resumed the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]''. "Someday Some Morning Sometime," featuring a [[vibraphone]] filtered through a [[space echo]], was identified by Tweedy as being the "piece to the puzzle" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 175</ref> The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. III]]'', also part of ''[[Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions]]''.

===Departure from Reprise Records and ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' (2001–2002)===
[[File:Marina City, Chicago, Illinois, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-20, DD 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Marina City|Marina Towers]] in [[Chicago, IL|Chicago]] are depicted on the cover of ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]].]]
{{Listen|filename=I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.ogg|title="I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"|description=The first track from ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', this song featured an intro on bells composed by Glenn Kotche.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Shortly after the recording sessions for ''Mermaid Avenue Vol. II'', Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 168</ref> The band recorded tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (album)|Bad Timing]]''. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer [[Glenn Kotche]], and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named [[Loose Fur]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 177–9</ref> Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 186–8</ref>

Although Bennett sought to be the mixer and engineer for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities compared to O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 195–6</ref> Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart", and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as "Poor Places", only featured the Loose Fur trio.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 198–9</ref> The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|title=In from the Cold|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=May 2002}}</ref> The recording of the album was documented by [[Sam Jones (filmmaker)|Sam Jones]] and released in 2002 as the film ''[[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco]]''.

Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with [[America Online]] in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. 

David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 201</ref> Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disliked the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 202</ref> He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the [[album]] was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 203</ref>

Wilco managed to negotiate a buy-out from Reprise. [[Music journalist]] Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''.<ref>Kot 2004, p. 207</ref> The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0108150038aug15.story?coll=chi-leisure-hed|title=Wilco's Shot in the Arm|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 15, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010826133635/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0108150038aug15.story?coll=chi-leisure-hed|archive-date=August 26, 2001}} Last accessed via the [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] on July 15, 2007.</ref> However, AllMusic claims "Warner/[[Reprise Records|Reprise]] agreed to sell them the masters for a reported $50,000" after Wilco was "unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable'." In a last-minute decision, the label freed Wilco from their contract and gave them the album at no charge.<ref name="AllMusic biography">{{cite web |last=Deming |first=Mark |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=wilco-mn0000254215#biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Wilco Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}}</ref> Curbing the negative publicity, Warner Music Group began to invest more in bands including [[The Flaming Lips]]. Lead singer [[Wayne Coyne]] remarked:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 209</ref>

<blockquote>We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, "we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again." They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!</blockquote>

As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it on their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality [[MP3]]s.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 225–6</ref> The band signed with [[Nonesuch Records]], another [[Time Warner]] subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' reached number thirteen on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], Wilco's highest chart position to that date.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|magazine=Billboard|date=May 11, 2002}}</ref> ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best-selling album.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite magazine|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/wilco-in-the-comfort-zone-1052800/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519155816/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052800/wilco-in-the-comfort-zone|archive-date=May 19, 2007|title=Wilco: In the Comfort Zone|magazine=Billboard|date=April 13, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' was met with extensive critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll and was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by ''[[Q Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/pazznjop/02/ |title=Pazz & Jop 2002 |newspaper=The Village Voice |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220134654/http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/pazznjop/02/ |archive-date=February 20, 2003 }} Last accessed July 15, 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=2006 Q Magazine Readers' 100 Greatest Albums Ever|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=February 2006}}</ref><ref>Levy 2005. p. 216</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated it at 493 of their 500 Greatest Albums of all Time, in May 2012.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 31, 2012|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> In the 2020 reboot of the list, its ranking was raised to #225.

In September 2022 the band released a variety of reissues of the album, including an 11-LP "Super Deluxe" version. The reissue won a [[65th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for Best Historical Album.

===''Down with Wilco'', ''A Ghost Is Born'', and ''Kicking Television'' (2003–2005)===
While waiting for the commercial release of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', Wilco agreed to support [[R.E.M.]] collaborator [[Scott McCaughey]] for an album release by [[The Minus 5]]. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks that day.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 220</ref> Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to "create something good in the world right now" and record some material.<ref name="Two">Kot 2004. p. 221</ref> Influenced by [[Bill Fay]]'s ''[[Time of the Last Persecution]]'', The Minus 5's ''[[Down with Wilco]]'' was released in 2003.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 222</ref> Keyboardist [[Mikael Jorgensen]], who had engineered ''Down with Wilco'', joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''.
[[File:Wired Wilco.jpg|thumb|left|Wilco at the [[Wired (magazine)|Wired Rave]] Awards in 2003]]
In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed ''Foxtrot'' and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike ''Summerteeth'' and ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'' featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live.<ref name="Kot3">Kot 2004. p. 240–1</ref> The album featured the song "Less Than You Think", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called "the track that everyone will hate". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song:<ref name="Kot3"/>

{{blockquote|I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say it's a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great&nbsp;... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it.}}

Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pouncey|first=Edwin|title=Free the Spirit|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|date=August 2004}}</ref> Like ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release.

=== Jay Bennett documentary, ''Cruel Country'', and ''Cousin'' (2021–present)===
In 2021, a feature-length documentary about the life of Jay Bennett was released. The film focused heavily on Bennett's years with Wilco. Directed by [[Gorman Bechard]] and Fred Uhter, the music documentary held its world premiere in Chicago in November 2021;<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilkinson |first=Sean |title=A documentary on Jay Bennett is coming to the Davis Theater in Chicago |url=https://www.smilepolitely.com/splog/a_documentary_on_jay_bennett_is_coming_to_the_davis_theater_in_chicago/ |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=Smile Politely |date=November 10, 2021 }}</ref> it was released on Blu Ray and pay-per-view on April 19, 2022, and as part of a [[Record Store Day]] release with vinyl editions of Bennett's last two albums, ''Whatever Happened I Apologize'' and ''Kicking at the Perfumed Air'' on April 23, 2022.<ref>{{Citation |title=RSD '22 Special Release: Jay Bennett - "Kicking at the Perfumed Air" & "Whatever Happened I Apologize" with the film "Where are you, Jay Bennett?" |url=https://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/14740 |language=en |access-date=2022-06-14}}</ref>

"The new film does a wonderful job of capturing the quirkiness, inventiveness and brilliance of someone who never met an instrument he couldn't play. Bennett once described hearing the open spaces of the songs and holes that became his sonic landscape. They were at the core of the remarkable string of Wilco's albums ''[[Being There (Wilco album)|Being There]]'', ''[[Summerteeth]],'' and ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]''."<ref>{{cite web |last=Wosahla |first=Steve |date=2022-04-21 |title=Jay Bennett, Gone Too Soon (Where are you, Jay Bennett?–Film Review) |url=https://americanahighways.org/2022/04/21/jay-bennett-gone-too-soon-where-are-you-jay-bennett-film-review/ |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=Americana Highways}}</ref>

The film was originally started by Uhter, who asked the prolific Bechard to take over the project when it stalled. It takes a hard look at Bennett's treatment in the previous Wilco documentary, ''[[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|I Am Trying To Break Your Heart]]'', which many consider to be unfair. "Jay Bennett's reputation never quite recovered from the battering it took in Sam Jones' documentary ''I Am Trying To Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco'', about the complex, lengthy gestation of 2002's ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' in often painful detail, portrayed a band slowly pulling itself apart, with chief songwriters Bennett and Jeff Tweedy its twin opposing forces. The implication being that Bennett was a headstrong, intractable figure responsible for most of the discord. He was sacked as soon as the album was done. Filmmakers Gorman Bechard and Fred Uhter seek to redress the balance on ''Where Are You, Jay Bennett?"''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-27 |title=Where are you, Jay Bennett? |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/film-reviews/where-are-you-jay-bennett-138572/ |access-date=2022-06-13 |website=UNCUT |language=en-GB}}</ref> The film painted a much more balanced picture of the relationship between Bennett and Tweedy. "They just happened to be two egos at that point, fueled by a lot of demons. And it just wasn't working anymore," Bechard explained. "They're both incredibly talented. They both had egos. They both, I think, saw maybe different paths for the band. And ultimately it was Jeff's band, so he's going to win that, and rightfully so. There were other issues, whether it be alcohol or drugs.

'''Will Hoge''' (born November 14, 1972<ref name="tennessean.com">[http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080822/ENTERTAINMENT01/80822064 ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>) is an American [[Americana (music)|Americana]] [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and [[musician]] from [[Nashville, Tennessee]], United States.

==Early life==
Will Hoge was born and grew up in [[Franklin, Tennessee]], located just south of Nashville.  His sound was influenced by his musician father and uncles and the extensive record collection that his father kept.

Hoge attended [[Western Kentucky University]] to study history, planning to become a high school history teacher and basketball coach.  He decided that he wanted to try his hand at [[rock and roll]] and began writing music.  Will left the university after realizing he wanted to be a musician.

==Early band==
Will released an early [[extended play|EP]] of original music with his band Spoonful in the mid-1990s.  However, the band was not picked up and eventually disbanded.  Some of these early songs were recycled on later albums, and are still hits with his loyal followers.

==Solo artist==
[[File:Will Hoge Concert.jpg|thumb|left|Hoge in concert, September 25, 2010 in Nashville]]With former [[The Georgia Satellites]] guitarist [[Dan Baird]] in tow, Hoge began touring the American south.  He independently released his first [[compact disc|CD]], ''Live At The Exit/In'', a live set recorded at the Nashville club.  His original sound drew much attention and, through constant touring, he was able to release his first studio album, ''Carousel''.

Hoge caught the attention of [[Atlantic Records]] music executives and he was signed to a record deal in early 2002.  Atlantic then re-released ''Carousel'' to a wider market.  His 2003 major label debut, ''Blackbird On A Lonely Wire'' was a cleaner sounding effort; however, the album was poorly promoted by Atlantic.  Eventually, Hoge asked for and received a release from his contract, re-obtaining the rights to ''Carousel''.

The support of his fans has given Hoge the ability to tour incessantly, and self-release a couple live albums (2004's ''Almost Alone: Live At Smith's Olde Bar''' and 2005's ''During the Before and After''), a politically charged album called ''The America EP'' (which included a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are A-Changin']])", and a bluesy rock and roll sounding album, ''The Man Who Killed Love''.

Over the years, Hoge has toured with many artists, including [[Midnight Oil]], [[Shinedown]], [[Needtobreathe]], [[Marc Broussard]], [[ZZ Top]], [[The Cat Empire]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Edwin McCain]].  Bands that have opened for him include [[Steel Train]], [[The Trews]], [[The Elms (band)|The Elms]], [[Rose Hill Drive]], [[Needtobreathe]], [[Moses Mayfield]], [[The Alternate Routes]], [[Aslyn]], [[Katie Herzig]], [[Missy Higgins]], and [[The Civil Wars]].

Hoge recorded the opening theme song, "You Make Me Happy," for the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Still Standing (American TV series)|Still Standing]]''.

On February 20, 2007, he released a live album, ''Again Somewhere Tomorrow'', from recordings made during the band's two-night stint at the Exit/In in Nashville, in September 2006.

The band's fourth studio album, ''Draw the Curtains'', was released nationwide in October 2007 by [[Rykodisc Records]]. The album was initially released as a [[CD]], with a limited edition 180-Gram [[Vinyl Record]] version which followed later.

Following a scooter accident in August 2008, the band went on hiatus for seven months while Hoge recuperated from his injuries.  In April 2009, the band got together for a 3-week acoustic tour of venues in the Midwest, Southeast and East Coast, hitting cities including New York City, Chicago, Nashville and Atlanta.  When the tour ended in late April, the band headed back into the studio to complete recording their next album (of which they had begun at the time of Hoge's accident).  Ken Coomer and Charlie Brocco again produced, and the album, ''The Wreckage'', was released on September 29, 2009.

Will Hoge performed a residency at 12th & Porter in [[Nashville, tn|Nashville, TN]] in June 2010.  During these concerts, many of Hoge's friends, family, and former bandmates joined him on stage during the run of the four shows.  These guests included former guitarists [[Dan Baird]], Brian Layson, and Jason 'Slim' Gambill; former keyboard players Jefferson Crowe and John Lancaster; as well as Will's own father, who sang lead vocals on the final song of the concert series.

On August 29, 2009, Will and the band appeared and performed the single "[[Even If It Breaks Your Heart]]" on the [[CBS Early Show]] as the music guest.

Hoge opened for [[Needtobreathe]] on their spring 2010 tour.  He also opened shows for [[Sugarland]] and [[Michelle Branch]] on select dates during their summer tour.

Hoge was part of a line-up, which included [[Keith Urban]], [[Dierks Bentley]], and [[Sheryl Crow]], that performed on the nationally televised "[[Music City Keep On Playin']]" flood relief program that aired on [[Great American Country|GAC]] on May 16, 2010.  Hoge closed the show by performing his song "Washed By The Water."

Hoge opened for mainstream rock band [[Shinedown]] on their acoustic "Anything & Everything" tour in the fall of 2010.

In September 2011, Hoge released his 7th studio album entitled 'Number Seven'.  The album was his third release via Ryko.  This time around, Hoge took over production duties for the entire album.  The album's first single "When I Get My Wings" was released to radio in August 2011.  The official music video for the song was added into rotation on both [[VH1]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0EIxUWO_0M&ob=av2n |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2016-01-04}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead YouTube link|date=February 2022}}</ref>  During this time, Hoge was invited to perform on three separate occasions at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], with country legend [[Vince Gill]] playing guitar and singing background vocals on a couple songs during his first appearance (Gill is a guest artist on 'Seven' as well, as he and his wife, [[Amy Grant]] are fans of Hoge).

In a September 2012 blog post on his website, Hoge announced a number of changes.  He left Rykodisc Records after releasing three albums with them. Longtime drummer Sigurdur 'Siggi' Birkis was released from the band.  They have yet to hire a permanent replacement.  He also announced in a Twitter post that [[Lady Antebellum]] was recording a cover of his song "Better Off Now" from his 2003 release "Blackbird On A Lonely Wire" which will be included on their next album.

In October 2012, Hoge announced, via Twitter, than he has signed a songwriting deal with BMG Nashville.

Hoge received a Country Music Association nomination, an Academy of Country Music nomination and a Grammy nomination for "Country Song of the Year" for "Even If It Breaks Your Heart". The song was recorded by the Eli Young Band and reached #1 on the country charts.

In 2013, he released ''[[Never Give In (Will Hoge album)|Never Give In]]''.  The album debuted at 129 on the Billboard 200, his highest debut on the chart, selling 3,000 copies in the US.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2013/10/13907-country-album-chart-news-the-week-of-october-23-2013-scotty-mccreery-willie-nelson-duets-chase-rice-cassadee-pope-lead/ |title= Country Album Chart News: The Week of October 23, 2013: Scotty McCreery, Willie Nelson Duets, Chase Rice, Cassadee Pope Lead|author= Matt Bjorke |date= October 23, 2013 |work=Roughstock }}</ref> The album's final track "Strong" was featured in a television commercial for Chevy trucks and contributed to the album's success.

On April 7, 2015, Hoge released his album ''Small Town Dream''.  The album debuted at No. 162 on the [[Billboard 200]] and No. 15 on the Top Country Albums chart, selling 3,700 copies for the week.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2015/04/34260-country-album-chart-report-april-15-2015/ |title=Country Album Chart Report For April 15, 2015 |author= Matt Bjorke |date= April 15, 2015 |website=Roughstock.com|access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EU88r4wxrG4FTpfeCEwITPzwOmXju-uOIenH4ILNNG0/edit#gid=0 |title=10 Country Albums - April 15, 2015 - Google Sheets |website=Docs.google.com |date=2015-04-15 |access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref>

On August 11, 2017, Hoge released ''[[Anchors (Will Hoge album)|Anchors]]'', which debuted at No. 14 on the Independent Albums chart,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/independent-albums/2017-09-02|title= Independent Albums: Week of September 2, 2017|magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 12, 2017}}</ref>  with 1,900 copies sold in its first week.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2017/08/42177-top-10-country-albums-sales-chart-august-20-2017 |title=Top 10 Country Albums Sales Chart: August 21, 2017 |first= Matt |last= Bjorke |date= August 22, 2017 |work=Roughstock }}</ref>

In 2018 Hoge released his 11th studio album, the politically-charged ''My American Dream''. He also toured with punk rock band Social Distortion after lead singer Mike Ness heard Hoge on satellite radio, thanks to a free subscription with his new car.  Ness invited Hoge to tour together.<ref>as told by Hoge and Ness in Toronto, ON 2018-10-10</ref>

Hoge's next album, ''Tiny Little Movies'', was released in June 2020. His latest effort, ''Wings On My Shoes'', is slated for release on 26 August 2022.

==Motorcycle accident==
Hoge was involved in a motorcycle accident on August 20, 2008 after leaving a studio session for what would be his next album, "The Wreckage." He was traveling north on Main Street in [[East Nashville]] at about 8 p.m. when a van traveling southbound failed to yield while turning into 712 Main St.  Hoge's motorcycle collided with the passenger side of the van. He was admitted to [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] in critical condition.  He went into surgery immediately upon arrival at the hospital for numerous broken bones (ribs, sternum, shattered femur, knee cap, shoulder blades), and lacerations to his face, arms, and torso requiring over 200 stitches.  Hoge's condition was upgraded to stable on August 22.<ref name="tennessean.com"/>  No evidence was found that alcohol or drugs were involved in the accident.<ref>[http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080821/TUNEIN/80821015 ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>

In the year following the accident, Hoge went through numerous surgical procedures (mainly on his shattered femur/leg) and intensive physical therapy.  Work on ''The Wreckage'', as well as tour dates, were postponed through spring 2009.  Since that point, Hoge has made a full recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.willhoge.com/blog?descp=update-on-will&maindivId=&divId=1&subId=1&main= |title=News — Will Hoge |website=Willhoge.com |date=2015-02-06 |access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref>

'''Joseph Will Oldham''' (born January 15, 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and actor. From 1993 to 1997, he performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under variations of '''Palace''' (Palace, Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, and Palace Music).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Will Oldham (Bonnie Prince Billy) |url=https://www.wypr.org/podcast/essential-tremors/2022-04-28/will-oldham-bonnie-prince-billy |access-date=2022-06-14 |website=WYPR |language=en}}</ref> After briefly publishing music under his own name, in 1998 he adopted '''Bonnie''' "'''Prince'''" '''Billy''' as the name for most of his work.

==Early life and education==
Oldham was born on January 15, 1970, in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>Alan Licht (Ed.) (2012), ''Will Oldham on Bonnie "Prince" Billy''. Faber and Faber Ltd., London, pp. viii. {{ISBN|978-0-571-25814-7}}.</ref> His mother, Joanne Lei Will Tafel Oldham, was a teacher and artist.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joanne Oldham (1942 - 2020) - Obituary|url=https://www.legacy.com/amp/obituaries/louisville/195122836|access-date=2020-10-23|website=legacy.com}}</ref> His father, Joseph Collins Oldham, was an attorney and photographer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joseph Oldham - Obituary|url=https://www.legacy.com/amp/obituaries/louisville/19382161|access-date=2020-10-23|website=legacy.com}}</ref> Oldham graduated from the [[J. Graham Brown School]] in 1988. He attended [[Brown University]] sporadically while pursuing a career as an actor, and living between [[Brooklyn]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Bloomington, Indiana]].<ref name="IPM">{{cite web | publisher = [Indiana Public Media] | date = February 17, 2016 | author=Adam Schwartz | title = Bonnie "Prince" Billy Tells of His Royal Roots | url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/bonnie-prince-billy-tells-of-his-royal-roots.php | access-date = July 14, 2021 }}</ref> He began making music during this time, initially as a project for his professor [[Jeff Todd Titon]], an ethnomusicologist at Brown University.<ref name="wire">{{cite web | publisher = [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] | date = March 14, 2013 | author=Derek Walmsley | title = Exclusive Bonnie 'Prince' Billy Interview | url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/interviews/exclusive-bonnie_prince_billy-interview | access-date = January 25, 2016 }}</ref>

== Career ==
[[File:Will Oldham 2017.jpg|thumb|Oldham in 2017]]
Oldham is known for his "[[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself]] punk aesthetic and blunt honesty",<ref name="chico">{{cite web | publisher = Chico News & Review | date = March 28, 2002 | author=Baldwin, C. | title = The Wanderer | url=http://www.newsreview.com/chico/Content?oid=8724 | access-date = May 8, 2007 }}</ref> and his music has been likened to [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[Traditional music|roots]], [[country music|country]], [[punk music|punk]], and [[indie rock]]. He has been called an "[[Appalachia]]n [[post-punk]] [[solipsist]]",<ref name="chico"/> with a voice that has been described as "a fragile sort-of warble frittering around haunted melodies in the American folk or country tradition."<ref name="chico"/>

Oldham first performed and recorded under various permutations of the Palace name, including Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, Palace Music, and simply Palace. Regarding the name changes during this period (1993–1997), Oldham said:
{{cquote|I guess the idea is that when you have a name of a group or an artist, then you expect that the next record, if it has the same name, should be the same group of people playing on it. And I just thought we were making a different kind of record each time, with different people, and different themes, and different sounds. So I thought it was important to call it something different so that people would be aware of the differences.<ref name="phoenix"/>}}

Will stated in a 1995 interview with [[KCRW]] that the name Palace Flophouse was inspired by reading [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]''. Beginning in 1998, Oldham has primarily used the moniker Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, which draws inspiration from several sources:
{{cquote|[T]he name has so many different references that it could almost have a life of its own. [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] has such a beautiful ring to it, and I was very conscious of appropriating that mellifluous sound. And I was also thinking about the name [[Nat King Cole]]. But it wasn't until later, and this may have been subconscious, that I remembered that [[Billy the Kid]] was William Bonney or Billy Bonney.<ref name="phoenix">{{cite web | work = [[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] | date = January 20, 2003 | author = Ashare, Matt | title = Mystery Man: Palace Brother Will Oldham becomes Bonnie 'Prince' Billy | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/top/documents/02671921.htm | access-date = May 9, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202151640/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/top/documents/02671921.htm | archive-date = December 2, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>}}

He has explained that "the primary purpose of the pseudonym is to allow both the audience and the performer to have a relationship with the performer that is valid and unbreakable."<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Foggy Notion |date=April 2003 | title = Bonnie 'Prince' Billy | url=http://www.dragcity.com/press/pimages/pressclips/dc233fn_art.pdf | access-date = May 8, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070710021351/http://www.dragcity.com/press/pimages/pressclips/dc233fn_art.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = July 10, 2007}}</ref>
