==Biography==
===Early career===
He was born in [[Lenapah, Oklahoma]], United States.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Downing began his career doing piano and vocals in [[Bobby Poe]] and The Poe Kats,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> who were an early backing band for country entertainer [[Wanda Jackson]]. His piano contributed to the single "Let's Have A Party", which was released in 1960. The song reached No. 32 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made the Top 40 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]].

Downing reached the U.S. Hot 100 with "You’ll Never Miss the Water (Till the Well Runs Dry)", a duet with [[Little Esther Phillips]]. After the release of this single, he was signed by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1974, Downing recorded the single, "[[I'll Be Holding On]]", which went to number one on the U.S. [[Disco]] chart for three weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974–2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=83}}</ref> In addition, "I'll Be Holding On" was a hit in Europe.

===Country music with Warner Brothers===
Al Downing's popularity continued to grow, and he had several hits on the country charts between 1978 and 1989. He compiled a list of his own songs, which he presented to his producer at Warner Brothers. In 1978, "Mr. Jones" reached the Top 20, followed by "Touch Me (I'll Be Your Fool Once More)" in 1979. That same year, Downing produced "Midnight Lace," which reached the 50s on the charts, and "I Ain't No Fool," which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the "Story Behind The Story" reached the Top 40 and "Bring It On Home" reached the Top 20.

Two years passed before Downing created another hit, this time with the Team label. In 1982, "I'll Be Loving You" reached the Top 50, followed by "Darlene," which reached the lower 60s. The next year, "It Takes Love" reached the Top 40, followed by "Let's Sing About Love," which peaked in the mid-60s. In 1984, "The Best Of Families" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, "There’ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong".

===Vine Street years===
In 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the "Oh How Beautiful You Are" (To Me) and "Just One Night Won't Do," both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, "I Guess By Now."

The popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: "Mary, Oh Mary" and "Heartbreak Hill". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby "Blue" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.

===Later career===
Downing built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including "Mr. Jones."

In July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.

In 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.

Downing continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at [[Ontario]]'s [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Roy Clark]]. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.

==Style==
Downing's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.

== Producer ==
In additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent. In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represented his last recording.

'''Bill Haley & His Comets''' was an American [[rock and roll]] band formed in 1947 and continuing until Haley's death in 1981. The band was also known as '''Bill Haley and the Comets''' and '''Bill Haley's Comets'''. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group recorded nine Top 20 singles, one of which was number one and three that were Top Ten. The single "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" was the best-selling rock single in the history of the genre and maintained that position for several years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Vladimir|last2=Woodstra|first2=Chris|last3=Erlewine|first3=Stephen Tomas|date=2003|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music|location=|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=315|isbn=0-87930-760-9}}</ref>

Band leader [[Bill Haley]] had previously been a [[Western swing]] performer; after recording a [[rockabilly]] version of [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]'s "[[Rocket 88]]", one of the first rock and roll recordings, Haley changed his band's musical direction to rock music. They went on to record hit versions of "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]", "[[Shake, Rattle & Roll]]", the aforementioned "Rock Around the Clock", "Dim, Dim the Lights", "[[Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie]]", "Razzle-Dazzle", "[[See You Later, Alligator]]", "[[When the Saints Go Marching In|The Saints Rock 'N' Roll]]" and "[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]". In 1956, the group appeared in two early rock and roll movies with disc jockey [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]''.

Though the group was considered to be at the forefront of rock and roll during the genre's formative years, the arrival of more risqué acts such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]] by 1956 led the more clean-cut Haley and his Comets to decline in popularity. Haley would remain popular in [[Europe]] and go on to have a comeback as a nostalgia act in the 1970s, along with many of his contemporaries. Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally.

==Early history==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Comets Ed Sullivan 1955.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley and the Comets on the Ed Sullivan Show or Toast of the Town, Sunday, August 7, 1955, CBS, Hartford, Connecticut]] -->
In around the mid-1940s, Bill Haley performed with the Down Homers and formed a group called the Four Aces of Western Swing. The group that later became the Comets initially formed as "Bill Haley and the Saddlemen" {{Circa|1949}}–1952, and performed mostly country and western songs, though occasionally with a bluesy feel. The group was also the first to record a cover version (in July 1951) of [[Rocket 88]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edsullivan.com/artists/bill-haley-his-comets/|title=Artists, Bill Haley & His Comets|date=June 14, 2015|work=Ed Sullivan|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> originally a [[jump blues]] song by [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats, who were actually [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]. He did so for the [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Holiday Records]] label, in what is now recognized as a [[rockabilly]] style. It sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s [[rhythm and blues]] song called "[[Rock the Joint]]" for Holiday's sister company, [[Essex Records]].

During those years however, Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America. Many Saddlemen recordings were not released until the 1970s and 1980s, and highlights included romantic ballads such as "Rose of My Heart" and [[western swing]] tunes such as "Yodel Your Blues Away." The original members of this group were Haley, pianist and accordion player [[Johnny Grande]] and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Billy Williamson (guitarist)|Billy Williamson]]. Al Thompson was the group's first bass player, followed by [[Al Rex]] and [[Marshall Lytle]]. During the group's early years, it recorded under several other names, including Johnny Clifton and His String Band and [[Reno Browne]] and Her Buckaroos (although Browne, a female matinee idol of the time, did not actually appear on the record).

"Rocket 88", "Rock the Joint", and their immediate follow-ups were released under the increasingly incongruous Saddlemen name. It soon became apparent that a new name for the group was needed to fit the new musical style. A friend of Haley's, making note of the common mispronunciation of the name [[Halley's Comet]] to rhyme with ''Bailey'', suggested that Haley call his band the Comets. This event is cited in the Haley biographies ''Sound and Glory'' by John Haley and John von Hoelle; ''Bill Haley'' by John Swenson; and in ''Still Rockin' Around the Clock'', a memoir by Comets bass player Marshall Lytle.

The new name for the group was adopted in the fall of 1952, before the 1953 release of "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]" which had some elements of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2135591-Bill-Haley-With-Haleys-Comets-Crazy-Man-Crazy|title=Bill Haley With Haley's Comets* – Crazy Man, Crazy|date=July 6, 2017|work=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> Members of the group at that time were Haley, Johnny Grande, Billy Williamson and Marshall Lytle. Grande usually played piano on records but switched to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and easier to deal with during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around. Soon after renaming the band Haley hired his first drummer, Earl Famous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/jodimars1.html|title=RAB Hall of Fame: The Jodimars|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215123/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Jodimars1.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Displeased with the lineup, Haley sought out Dick Boccelli (also known as Dick Richards), who turned down the job but recommended a young drummer Charlie Higler. Soon after, Haley asked Richards again, who then accepted the role. During this time (and as late as the fall of 1955), Haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player, choosing to use session musicians on records and either playing lead guitar himself or having Williamson play steel solos.

Even before the release of more successful records, the group had achieved greatness in some respects: "No one had blended country and R&B on a single before the Comets' "Rock the Joint". No one had scored an American Top 20 hit with anything that could really qualify as rock'n'roll before their single "Crazy Man Crazy" in 1953".<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/22/bill-haley-rock-around-the-clock-worlds-first-rock-anthem|title=Bill Haley: Rock Around the Clock – the world's first rock anthem|date=May 22, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

==National success and "Rock Around the Clock"==
[[File:BillHaleyHankSnowTicket.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley/Elvis/Hank Snow Ticket – Oklahoma City newspaper ad. for Sunday October 16, 1955; two shows at the Municipal Auditorium. Note: Elvis Presley's first appearance to be co-promoted (with Hank Snow) by Colonel Tom Parker.]]
In 1953, Haley scored his first national success with his original song, "Crazy Man, Crazy", a phrase Haley said he heard from his teenage audience, again released on Essex. Haley later claimed the recording sold a million copies, but this is considered an exaggeration. Some sources indicate that the recording—a blend of R&B, western and pop music—is a contender for the title of "first rock'n'roll record" while others state that it was merely "the first rock and roll song to be a hit on the pop charts". It was also said to be the first rock'n'roll recording to be played on national television in the United States (in an episode of [[Omnibus (American TV program)]] in 1953).<ref>{{cite book |last=Kallen |first=Stuart |date=May 9, 2012 |title=The History of American Pop |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zohmDwAAQBAJ&q=Crazy+Man%2C+Crazy+bill+haley+million&pg=PA33 |publisher=Greenhaven Publishing LLC |pages=33–34 |isbn=978-1420506723}}</ref>

On their last release from Essex, new band member Joey Ambrose is heard on the B-side, "Straight Jacket."

In the spring of 1954, Haley and His Comets left Essex for New York-based [[Decca Records]], where they were placed under the auspices of veteran producer [[Milt Gabler]], who would produce all of the band's recordings for the label and who had been involved in creating many proto-rock and roll recordings by the likes of the [[The Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]] and [[Louis Jordan]] dating back to the 1940s. One of Jordan's records, [[Saturday Night Fish Fry]] (1949), is considered to be a contender for the title of "first rock'n' roll record. Gabler later commented that "all the tricks I used with Louis Jordan, I used with Bill Haley".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30288/5-candidates-first-rock-n-roll-song |title=5 Candidates for the First Rock 'n' Roll Song |date=March 23, 2012 |publisher=Mentalfloss |access-date=August 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://wwwrock'n'roll.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/16/popandrock#:~:text=The%20most%20widely%20held%20belief,records%20and%20discover%20Elvis%20Presley] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>

The group's first session, on April 12, 1954, yielded "[[Rock Around the Clock]]", which would become Haley's biggest hit and one of the most important records in rock and roll history. Sales of "Rock Around the Clock" started slowly, since it was the B-side of the single, but it performed well enough, that a second Decca session was commissioned.

"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]" followed, a somewhat bowdlerized cover version of the [[Big Joe Turner]] recording<ref name=pc4>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19750/m1/ |title=Show 4 – The Tribal Drum: The Rise of Rhythm and Blues. [Part 2] }}</ref> released earlier in 1954. The single was one of Decca's best-selling records of 1954<ref>''Billboard'', January 15, 1955, p. 38.</ref> and the seventh-best-selling record in November 1954.<ref>''Billboard'', November 13, 1954, p. 64.</ref>

In 1954, [[Anita Gordon]] starred in ''Round Up of Rhythm'', a film short in which she, and Disc Jockey Bill Delzell, played ' Straight Jacket ' and 'Shake Rattle and Roll', which the group are seen playing.

In March 1955, the group had four songs in Cash Box magazine's top 50 songs: "Dim, Dim the Lights (I Want Some Atmosphere)"; "Birth of the Boogie"; "Mambo Rock"; and "Shake, Rattle and Roll."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550305.html|title=Cash Box Top Singles 3/05/55|publisher=Cashboxmagazine.com|date=March 5, 1955|access-date=November 4, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422080253/http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550305.html|archive-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref>

Haley's "Shake, Rattle and Roll" never achieved the same level of historical importance as "Rock Around the Clock" but it predated it as the first international rock and roll hit. It did not attain the Number 1 position on the American charts, but it became Haley's first gold record. [[Elvis Presley]] recorded the song in 1956, combining Haley's arrangement with Turner's original lyrics, but his version was not a substantial hit. Late in 1954, Haley recorded another hit, "Dim, Dim The Lights", which was one of the first R&B songs recorded by a white group to cross over to the R&B charts. [[Johnnie Ray]] had reached Number 1 with "[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]" in 1952.

The belated success of "Rock Around the Clock" is attributed to its use in the soundtrack of the film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]],''<ref name=pc5>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19751/m1/ |title=Show 5 – Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The Rock Revolution Gets Underway. [Part 1] }}</ref> which was released on March 19, 1955. The song was re-released to coincide with the film and shifted to the single's A-side. Haley's recording became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/bill-haley|title=Bill Haley|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=October 10, 2016}}</ref> and reached Number 1 on the pop charts, remaining there for eight weeks,<ref name="auto1">[https://www.billboard.com/articles//6634450/rewinding-the-charts-60-years-ago-bill-haley-ushered-in-the-rock-era] {{Dead link|date=May 2021|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> and went to Number 3 on the R&B chart.<ref>

Ambrose's acrobatic saxophone playing, along with Lytle on the double bass – literally on it, riding it like a pony, and holding it over his head – were highlights of the band's live performances during this time. Their music and their act were part of a tradition in [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]], but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience. In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a [[short subject]] entitled ''Round Up of Rhythm'', performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217775/|title=Round Up of Rhythm (1954) - IMDb|access-date=November 24, 2020|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

In 1955, Lytle, Richards and Ambrose quit the Comets in a salary dispute and formed their own group, the [[The Jodimars|Jodimars]]. Haley hired several new musicians to take their place: [[Rudy Pompilli]] on sax, Al Rex (a former member of the Saddlemen) on double bass, and Ralph Jones on drums. In addition, lead guitarist [[Franny Beecher]], who had been a session musician for Haley since [[Danny Cedrone]]'s death in the spring of 1954, became a full-time Comet and Haley's first performing lead guitarist (Cedrone had played the guitar solo on the original recording of "Rock Around the Clock" and died shortly after the recording session for "Shake, Rattle and Roll" in the summer of 1954). This version of the band became more popular than the earlier manifestation and appeared in several [[motion pictures]] over the next few years.

Other hits recorded by the band included "[[See You Later, Alligator]]"<ref name=pc5/> in which Haley's frantic delivery contrasted with the [[Louisiana]] languor of the original by [[Bobby Charles]], "Don't Knock the Rock", "Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie", "Rudy's Rock" (the first instrumental hit of the rock and roll era), and "Skinny Minnie."

Bill Haley and the Comets performed "Rock Around the Clock" in an a cappella and a lip-synched version on the [[NBC]] television program ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' hosted by [[Milton Berle]] on May 31, 1955. Berle predicted that the song would go to Number 1, calling the band "A group of entertainers who are going right to the top." Berle also sang and danced to the song, which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre a much wider audience.

Bill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll performers to appear on the [[CBS]] television musical variety program ''The [[Ed Sullivan Show]], or Toast of the Town'' on Sunday, August 7, 1955, in a broadcast from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. They performed a live version of "Rock Around the Clock" featuring Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The group made a second and final appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'' on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing "[[Rudy's Rock]]" and "Forty Cups of Coffee."

Bill Haley and the Comets appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television twice in 1957, on the prime-time show on October 28 and on the regular daytime show on November 27. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' (also known as ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]''), a prime-time TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season (performing "Rock Around the Clock" and "Ooh, Look-a There, Ain't She Pretty") and on February 20, 1960 (performing "Rock Around the Clock" and "Tamiami").

In 1956, the group appeared in two of the earliest full-length rock and roll movies with [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]].'' The [[The Platters|Platters]] were co-stars in the first movie, and [[Little Richard]] appeared in the second. ''Rock Around the Clock'' was produced by Sam Katzman (who would produce several Elvis Presley films in the 1960s) and directed by Fred F. Sears.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=1403164%7C184955&name=Rock-Around-the-Clock|title=&#124;Rock Around the Clock |website=Tcm.com|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

==Decline in popularity==
The band's popularity in the United States began to wane in 1956–57 as sexier, wilder acts such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]] began to dominate the record charts (although Haley's cover version of Little Richard's "[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]", released in direct competition with Little Richard's original recording, outsold the original). After "Skinny Minnie" hit the charts in 1958, Haley had little further success in the United States, although a spin-off group made up of Comets musicians dubbed '''The Kingsmen''' (no relation to the later group of "[[Louie, Louie]]" fame) had a hit with an instrumental, "Weekend", that same year.

Overseas, however, Haley and his band continued to be popular, touring the United Kingdom in February 1957, when Haley and his crew were mobbed by thousands of fans at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] in London at an incident which the media dubbed the "Second [[Battle of Waterloo]]". The group also toured Australia in 1957, and in 1958 enjoyed a successful (if riot-dominated) tour of the European mainland. Bill Haley & His Comets were the first major American rock and roll act to tour the world in this way. Elvis, who was [[Elvis Presley's Army career|on military duty]] in Germany, visited them backstage at some shows. On a free day in Berlin they performed two songs in the [[Caterina Valente]] movie ''Hier Bin ich Hier Bleib Ich (Here I Am Here I Stay)''.

Back in the U.S., Haley attempted to start his own record label, Clymax, and establish his own stable of performers, notably [[Sally Starr (TV hostess)|Sally Starr]] (the hostess of a Philadelphia television children's program) and the [[Matys Brothers]]. Members of the Comets were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings, many of which were written or co-written by Haley and members of the Comets. The Clymax experiment only lasted about a year. In 1959, Haley's relationship with Decca collapsed; after a final set of instrumental-only recordings in the fall, Haley announced he was leaving Decca for the new [[Warner Bros. Records]] label, which released two more albums in 1960, which were moderately successful. In 1960 Franny Beecher and Rudi Pompilli left the Comets to start their own record label. Replacing Beecher was a 20-year-old guitarist, [[Johnny Kay]], from Chester, Pennsylvania. Beecher later returned briefly to play with the Comets, when his record label failed to take off, sharing guitar duties with Kay. Kay left the band in 1966 but returned in the early 1970s for an aborted world tour. He appeared in the Wembley show, which was filmed and released as the London Rock and Roll Show.

==Mexico and the late 1960s==
In 1961–1962, '''Bill Haley y sus Cometas''' (as the band was known in Hispanic America) signed with the [[Orfeón]] label of Mexico and scored an unexpected hit with "Twist Español", a Spanish-language recording based on the [[Twist (dance)|twist]] dance craze, which was sweeping America at the time. Haley followed up with "Florida Twist" (#3 MEX, according to Billboard Hits Of The World 04.21.62), which was for a time the biggest-selling single in Mexican history. Although [[Chubby Checker]] and [[Hank Ballard]] were credited with starting the twist craze in America, in Mexico and Latin America, Bill Haley and His Comets were proclaimed the Kings of the Twist. Thanks to the success of "Twist Español" and "Florida Twist", among others, the band had continued success in Mexico and Latin America over the next few years, selling many recordings of Spanish and Spanish-flavored material and simulated live performances ([[overdubbed]] audience over studio recordings) on the Orfeon label and its subsidiary, Dimsa. They hosted a television series, ''Orfeon a Go-Go'', and made [[cameo appearance]]s in several movies, lip-synching some of their old hits. Haley, who was fluent in Spanish, recorded a number of songs in the language, but most of the band's output during these years was instrumental recordings, many utilizing local session musicians playing trumpet. There was also some experimentation with Haley's style during this time; one single for Orfeon was a folk ballad, "Jimmy Martinez", which Haley recorded without the Comets.

In 1966, the Comets (without Bill Haley) cut an album for Orfeon as session musicians for Big Joe Turner, who had always been an idol to Haley; no joint performance of "Shake, Rattle and Roll" was recorded, however. In a 1974 interview with [[BBC Radio]], Haley said Turner's career was in a slump at this time, so he used his then-considerable influence with Orfeon to get Turner a recording session. The Comets' association with Orfeon/Dimsa ended later that year.

By 1967, as related by Haley in an interview with radio host [[Red Robinson]] in that year, the group was "a free agent" without any recording contracts at all, although the band continued to perform regularly in North America and Europe. During this year, Haley—without the Comets—recorded a pair of demos in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]: a country-western song, "[[Jealous Heart]]", on which he was backed by a local [[mariachi]] band (similar in style to the earlier "Jimmy Martinez"), and a late-60s-style rocker, "Rock on Baby", backed by a group called Superfine Dandelion. Neither recording would be released for 30 years. In 1968, Haley and the Comets recorded a single for the [[United Artists]] label, a version of [[Tom T. Hall]]'s "[[That's How I Got to Memphis]]", but no long-term association with the label resulted. In order to revive his recording career, Haley turned to Europe.

==Revival==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Little Richard Columbia 1956.jpg|left|thumb|Little Richard and Bill Haley on the set of the 1956 Columbia Pictures film ''Don't Knock the Rock''.]] -->
By the late 1960s, Haley and the Comets were considered an "oldies" act. The band's popularity never waned in Europe. The group signed a lucrative deal with [[Sonet Records]] of Sweden in 1968 and recorded in a new version of "Rock Around the Clock", which hit the European charts that year. The band recorded a mixture of live and studio albums for the label over the next decade.

In the United States in 1969, promoter Richard Nader launched a series of [[rock and roll revival]] concert tours featuring artists of the 1950s and 1960s. At one of the first of these shows, held at the [[Felt Forum]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, Haley received an eight-and-a-half-minute standing ovation following his performance, as Nader related in his recorded introduction to Haley's live album ''Bill Haley Scrapbook'', which was recorded a few weeks later at the [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]] club in New York.

The band appeared in several concert films in the early 1970s, including ''[[The London Rock and Roll Show]]'' (for which Haley's 1960–66 lead guitarist, John Kay, briefly rejoined the band) and ''[[Let the Good Times Roll (film)|Let the Good Times Roll]]''. After 1974, tax and management problems prevented Haley from performing in the United States, so he performed in Europe almost exclusively, though he also toured South America in 1975. The band was also kept busy in the studio, recording numerous albums for Sonet and other labels in the 1970s, several with a [[country music]] flavor. In 1974, Haley's original Decca recording of "Rock Around the Clock" hit the American sales charts once again, thanks to its use in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and for two years, on the television program ''[[Happy Days]]''.<ref name="auto1"/>

==Late career==
In February 1976, Haley's saxophone player and best friend, [[Rudy Pompilli]], died of [[cancer]] after a nearly 20-year career with the Comets. Haley continued to tour for the next year with a succession of new sax players, but his popularity was waning again, and his 1976 performance in London was critically lambasted in the music media, such as ''[[Melody Maker]]''. That year, the group also recorded an album, ''R-O-C-K'' at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] for Sonet Records. According to one source, "he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFzMvgEACAAJ|title=Crazy Man, Crazy The Bill Haley Story|author=Bill Haley, Jr., Peter Benjaminson |page= |date=October 3, 2019 |publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=9781617137112|accessdate=November 10, 2023}}</ref> Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]],<ref name=FallingComet>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/falling-comet/|title=Falling Comet|date=2011-06-01|website=Texas Monthly|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=bill+haley+%22alcoholism%22&pg=PP15|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=2003|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|language=en}}</ref> Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. 
In early 1977, Haley announced his retirement from performing and settled down at his home in Mexico. According to the John Swenson biography of Haley, the musician was quoted as saying that he and Pompilli had an agreement that if one died, the other would retire.

The Comets continued to tour on their own during this period.

In 1979, Haley was persuaded to return to performing with the offer of a lucrative contract to tour Europe. An almost completely new group of musicians, mostly British, including saxophonist [[Pete Thomas (saxophonist)|Pete Thomas]], were assembled to perform as the Comets. Haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie ''Blue Suede Shoes'', filmed at one of his London concerts in March 1979. A few days later, a performance in [[Birmingham]] was videotaped and aired on UK television; it was released on DVD in 2005. During the March tour, Haley recorded several tracks in London for his next album for Sonet, completing the work that summer in Muscle Shoals; the album, ''Everyone Can Rock & Roll'', issued later in 1979, was the last release of new recordings by Haley before his death.

On November 26, 1979, Haley and the Comets performed for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance/archive/detail/1979-london-theatre-royal|title=Performances :: 1979, London Theatre Royal &#124; Royal Variety Charity|website=Royalvarietycharity.org|access-date=May 12, 2023}}</ref> a moment Haley considered the proudest of his career. It was also the last time he performed in Europe and the last time most fans saw him perform "Rock Around the Clock".{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

Haley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Just before the South African tour commenced, Haley's health was reportedly failing, and he was reportedly diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]]; a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled.  The tour was critically lambasted, but surviving recordings of a performance in [[Johannesburg]] show Haley in good spirits and good voice. Nonetheless, according to the Haley News fan club newsletter and the Haley biography ''Sound and Glory'', planned concerts (such as a fall 1980 tour of Germany) and proposed recording sessions in New York and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] were cancelled, including a potential reunion with past members of the Comets.

Despite his illness, Haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]]. 
The October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley's British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that "Haley had taken a fit [and] didn't recognize anyone anymore." In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable.<ref name="Bill Haley 1982. page 154">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll''. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. p. 154, {{ISBN|0-8128-2909-3}}</ref>  Haley's widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, "It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card."<ref name=FallingComet/>

Haley returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]].  At this time, Haley's alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time, and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. "There were days we never saw him," said his daughter Martha Maria.<ref name=FallingComet/> In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, "It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking." After being picked up by the police in Harlingen several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, "This is pointless." She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.<ref name=FallingComet/>

Media reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982,<ref name="Bill Haley 1982">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll'', pp. 155-159, John Swenson. (1982. Pub. Stein and Day, 1982), {{ISBN|0-8128-2909-3}}</ref> Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives toward the end of his life in which he was semi-coherent. His first wife has been quoted as saying, "He would call you and ramble, dwelling on the past..." The biography also describes Haley painting the windows of his home black,<ref name="Bill Haley 1982"/> but there is little other information available about his final days.

Haley died in his sleep of an apparent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on February 9, 1981, at the age of 55, at his home in Harlingen, Texas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Haley of 'Rock Around the Clock' Fame Dies in Texas Home|author=Belcher, Jerry|work= Los Angeles Times|page=2|date=February 10, 1981}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/10/obituaries/bill-haley-55-dies-singer-band-leader.html "Obituary for Bill Haley"], ''New York Times'', February 10, 1981.</ref> He was discovered lying motionless on his bed by a friend who had stopped by to visit him.

In April 1981, Bill Haley & His Comets returned to the British musical charts once again when MCA Records (inheritors of the Decca catalogue) released "Haley's Golden Medley", a hastily compiled edit of the band's best-known hits in the style of the then-popular "[[Stars on 45]]" format. The single reached Number 50 in the UK but was not released in the United States.

In 1987, Bill Haley was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. At that time, supporting bands were not also named to the Hall of Fame. This policy was subsequently changed, and in 2012 a special committee of the Hall of Fame inducted the Comets. Bill Haley and His Comets were also inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. In June 2005, Bill Haley And His Comets were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/71-bill-haley-and-his-comets|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends – BILL HALEY AND HIS COMETS|website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> In July 2005, the surviving members of the 1954–55 Comets (see below) represented Haley when Bill Haley and His Comets were inducted into [[Guitar Center|Hollywood's Rockwalk]], a ceremony also attended by Haley's second wife and youngest daughter. The Comets placed their handprints in cement, leaving a space blank for Haley.

==The Comets==
More than 100 musicians performed with Bill Haley & His Comets between 1952 and Haley's death in 1981, many becoming fan favorites along the way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=Bill Haley Extra Page 2 |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011233205/http://rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=October 11, 2011 }}</ref> Several short-lived Comets reunions were attempted in the 1970s and 1980s, including one contingent (organized by [[Baltimore]]-based piano player [[Joey Welz]], who played piano for the Comets from 1962 to 1965<ref name="The Bill Haley Who's Who">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=The Bill Haley Who's Who |publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |access-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054809/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 }}</ref>) that appeared on ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'', and another run by an [[Elvis Presley]] impersonator, Joey Rand (this group later lost a legal action over the right to use the Comets name). Only one group was sent out to perform by Haley himself and his management and production company, consisting of musicians who had played with Haley throughout the 1960s and 1970s—lead guitarist "Nick Masters" (Mathias Nicholas Nastos), bassist Ray Cawley, singer Ray "Pudge" Parsons, and drummer Buddy Dee—and who had continued to perform as the Comets between gigs and during Haley's retirement. This group rerecorded "Rock Around the Clock" for the television series ''Happy Days''.<ref name="The Bill Haley Who's Who"/>

'''The Comets''', featuring musicians who performed with Haley in 1954–1955, reunited in 1987 and are still touring the world as of 2007, playing showrooms in the United States and Europe. They have also recorded a half-dozen albums for small labels in Europe and the United States. This version of the group has also been credited as '''Bill Haley's Original Comets''' and, in circumstances in which the use of the Comets name is in dispute, '''A Tribute to Bill Haley''' and '''The Original Band'''. The basic lineup of this group from 1987 to May 2006 was Marshall Lytle (bass), Joey Ambrose (sax), Johnny Grande (piano), Dick Richards (drums) and Franny Beecher (guitar). British singer Jacko Buddin augmented the group on vocals during most of their European tours, with Lytle taking over on vocals for US and Canadian tours beginning in 2000 and full-time in Europe in the mid-2000s. Since they connected with Klaus Kettner's Rock It Concerts (Germany) in 1991, they have played hundreds of shows all over Europe and have appeared on dozens of television shows. In March 2007 they opened the Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany.

Two additional groups claim the name '''Bill Haley's Comets''' and have extensively toured in the United States since forming in the 1980s: one originally led by Haley's 1965–68 drummer John "Bam-Bam" Lane, the other run by Al Rappa, who played bass for Haley off and on between late 1959 and early 1969. (The 1959 album "Strictly Instrumental" on Decca was Rappa's first recording session with Bill Haley & His Comets. Haley had used Rappa as a fill-in player on live gigs for several years prior to that.) Both these musicians claim [[trademark]] ownership of the name "Bill Haley's Comets"; this dates back to Lane and Rappa (during a period when they worked together as one band) winning a trademark infringement lawsuit against the aforementioned Joey Rand group in 1989. Both Rappa's and Lane's bands have, from time to time, recruited other former Comets for their lineups (for example, in 2005, Rappa joined forces with Joey Welz), but for the most part the bandleaders are the only regular members who have worked with Bill Haley directly. Lane died in 2007, but his group continues to perform, led by bandleader Lenny Longo, who has no direct connection with Bill Haley. Rappa incorporated numerous professional musicians from the southern Indiana area (Guitarist Warren Batts, Joe Esarey, Dave Matthews, Joe Denton, saxophonist John Urbina, bassist Jody Hamilton Miley (previous bassist with the George Jones Show), and others) to make a full band. Rappa performed his Upright Bass show before thousands in audiences all over the country. Members of Rappa's "Comets" went on to form the LocoMotion Showband and continued touring the United States without Rappa adding Galen Deig (Drums) and Jimmy Baze (Bass) before eventually disbanding. Esarey went on to graduate from Cedarville University and Luther Rice Theological Seminary. He has since pastored churches and produced his own saxophone instrumental albums. Several of the members are now active in a very popular Southern Indiana 50's / 60's band called The Duke Boys.

In March and July 2005, the members of the 1954–55 group, now billed as simply the Comets after decades of controversy over the use of the name, made several high-profile concert appearances in New York City and Los Angeles organized by [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] as part of celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of rock and roll, the release of ''Blackboard Jungle'', the 50th anniversary of "Rock Around the Clock" hitting Number 1, and the 80th birthday of Bill Haley.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-film-that-helped-launch-rock/ |title=The Film That Helped Launch Rock |work=CBS News |date=March 18, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091217/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/18/sunday/main681742.shtml |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |title=Rock 'N' Roll Turns 50 in July |publisher=Seniorjournal.com |date=June 29, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014044137/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |archive-date=October 14, 2011 }}</ref> During a concert at the [[Viper Room]] in [[West Hollywood]] on July 6, 2005, the Comets were joined on stage for one song by [[Gina Haley]], the youngest daughter of Bill Haley; at a similar appearance in March they were joined by Haley's eldest son, John W. Haley. The 1954–55 Comets were also joined on stage by Bill Haley Jr. during several appearances in 2005 at Bubba Mac's in Somers Point, New Jersey, and at a 2005 concert recognizing the tenure of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen at the Twin Bars in Gloucester City, New Jersey.

In 2006, the 1954–55 Comets spent much of the year in residence at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. Meanwhile, the John Lane edition of Bill Haley's Comets recorded an album in Tennessee in early 2006, which has yet to be released.

On June 2, 2006, Johnny Grande, keyboardist with the 1954–55 Comets and a founding member of the band, died after a short illness. The following month, 85-year-old guitarist [[Franny Beecher]] announced his retirement, though he was at one point announced as participating in an early 2007 tour of Germany. The three remaining original Comets (Lytle, Richards, and Ambrose) continued to perform in Branson with new musicians taking over the keyboard and lead guitar positions. During September 2006, [[PBS]] in the United States aired a series of programs videotaped in Branson during the spring of 2006; these shows include the last recorded performances of the complete Original Comets lineup, including Grande. Lytle died in 2013, Beecher in 2014. The last remaining members of the 1954–55 Comets, Dick Richards and Joey Ambrose, continued to perform as the Comets as of mid-2018, sometimes augmented by 1970s-era Comet Bill Turner on lead guitar.

'''William Knight Kirchen''' (born June 29, 1948) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was a member of [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] from 1967 to the mid-1970s and later worked with [[Nick Lowe]]. ''Guitar Player'' magazine described Kirchen as "Titan of The [[Telecaster]]" for his prowess on the guitar.

==Early life==
Kirchen was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] but grew up in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]<ref name="New Haven"/> where he attended [[Pioneer High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Ann Arbor High School]] and learned to play the trombone.<ref name="AllMusic">Pendragon, Jana [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-kirchen-mn0000069922 Biography] AllMusic. Retrieved June 11, 2012</ref> He met a folksinger named David Siglin, long-time manager of local folk music venue [[The Ark (folk venue)|The Ark]], and joined the local folk scene. While learning to play banjo and guitar, his musical interest began to extend beyond folk music and included the blues and various string bands.<ref name="AllMusic"/> During his student days at [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], Kirchen started a "psycho folk-rock" band and later a country band that included [[George Frayne]] and [[John Tichy]] which formed the basis for the [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] band.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

==Career==
[[Image:BillKirchenAldenTheater.jpg|left|thumb|Onstage at the Alden Theater, McLean, Virginia (2004)]]
In 1969, Kirchen took Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen to California and they developed a reputation as musical "outlaws" that were praised by other outlaw musicians and bands like [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[The Grateful Dead]] and the [[Allman Brothers Band]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's band  "played a collection of rock 'n' roll, hard-core country, boogie and rockabilly sounds produced in a "high-octane mix" that made them a "happening" group in the San Francisco Bay area.<ref name="Crosstown">[http://64.33.96.73/CrosstownArts/client_music/kirchen/bkabout.htm Bill Kirchen and Too Much Fun] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424045324/http://64.33.96.73/CrosstownArts/client_music/kirchen/bkabout.htm |date=April 24, 2010 }} Crosstown Arts. Retrieved June 13, 2012</ref>

Kirchen began to develop as guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and performer. He became known for his vocal and guitar work on such songs as "Mama Hated Diesels",  "Down to Seeds and Stems Again Blues" from the band's albums, ''Hot Licks, Cold Steel & Truckers' Favorites'' and ''Lost in the Ozone''.<ref name="AllMusic"/> His live performance work was captured on the 1973 album ''Live From Deep in the Heart of Texas'', recorded at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in 1973.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's Commander Cody band broke apart in 1976 and he formed a "swing orchestra" called the Moonlighters and began a decades-long collaboration with British musician [[Nick Lowe]].  Lowe produced the Moonlighters' second album ''Rush Hour'', and Kirchen toured with Lowe and joined him in the studio from time to time. During this period Kirchen also worked on albums with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Gene Vincent]], and [[Link Wray]].<ref name="AllMusic"/>

[[Image:BillKirchenBehindHead.jpg|right|thumb|Onstage in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] (2005)]]
Around 1986, Kirchen moved to the Washington, D.C. area and formed the band Too Much Fun with Dave Elliot on drums and John Previti on bass.  In 1996, the band won ten Washington Area Music Awards including Musician and Songwriter of the Year.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Crosstown"/> Kirchen became a contemporary and associate of many D.C. guitarists such as the late [[Danny Gatton]] and [[Roy Buchanan]], Link Wray, [[Tom Principato]], [[Evan Johns]], [[Billy Hancock]], Linwood Taylor, Dave Chappell, [[Jimmy Thackery]], the Nighthawks and others who, during this time, forged an elite fraternity of Washington D.C. area roots rock performers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Kirchen recorded the album ''Tombstone Every Mile'' on Demon Records, while in England and then released the recording in the USA after he signed with Black Top Records in 1994.<ref name="AllMusic"/> He released the critically acclaimed and musically eclectic album, ''Have Love, Will Travel'' in 1996 and ''Raise a Ruckus'' on [[Hightone Records]] in 1999.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen followed up with more album releases on Hightone Records including ''Tied to the Wheel'' in 2001, ''Dieselbilly Road Trip'' in 2003, and ''King of Dieselbilly'' (2005).

In 2006, Bill kicked off his new deal with [[Proper Records]] by recording "Hammer of the Honky-Tonk Gods" at their London studio. The band on the album was Nick Lowe, [[Geraint Watkins]] and [[Robert Trehern]] and it was engineered by [[Paul Riley (musician)|Paul Riley]].

This was followed in 2010 by another album – "Word to the Wise", once again recorded at Proper's studio in London by Paul Riley, with a band comprising [[Austin de Lone]], [[Jonny Castle]] and [[Jack O'Dell (musician)|Jack O'Dell]]. The record featured many guests including: [[Paul Carrack]], Elvis Costello, [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[Blackie Farrell]], [[Dan Hicks (singer)|Dan Hicks]], Nick Lowe, [[Maria Muldaur]] and more.

In November 2012, Kirchen was a guest performer on [[Larry Monroe (radio personality)|Larry Monroe]]'s Texas Radio Live show on [[KDRP-LP|KDRP]].

2013 saw the third Proper Records album released – also recorded in London by Paul Riley.  The band on "Seeds And Stems" was Jack O'Dell and Maurice Cridlin with guest appearances from Austin de Lone and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] among others.

===Legacy===
Allmusic's Jana Pendragon credits Kirchen with being one of the musicians that pioneered the [[Americana music|Americana]] movement in the 1980s, and also with being a founding father of "twangcore," along with [[Dave Alvin]], [[Wilco]] and [[Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's signature sound has been dubbed "dieselbilly" and incorporates elements of [[country music|country]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[Western swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]], laced with themes of American truck driving music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Kirchen's work in the early 1970s with Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen helped set the stage for the singers like [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] and other [[outlaw country]] bands with his recordings of songs like "Seeds And Stems."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanamusicshow.com/episode159 |title=Bill Kirchen – Interview and Music |publisher=Americana Music Show |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2014}}</ref> Kirchen is said to have "one of the most distinctive, pure-Fender Telecaster tone guitar sounds in modern music".<ref name="New Haven"/>

Kirchen was named "The Titan of The Telecaster"  by ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine<ref name="New Haven"/> for his musical prowess on the [[Fender Telecaster]] guitar.

He has made numerous recordings, primarily in the [[rockabilly]] genre but also has a large body of recorded work in [[rock 'n' roll]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[country music]]. He performed live primarily in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area, but also played regularly at European roots music festivals.

==Early life==
Hancock was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and raised in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], where he has lived most of his life.  He attended George Washington High School in Alexandria, graduating in 1964. He came from a musical family. His maternal grandmother Katie sang with Minstrel shows in black face accompanying herself on piano and harmonica. Two of his aunts Eileen and Anita were a singing duo in the 1940s who sang at two or three Washington DC radios stations on a regular basis. His paternal grandfather Mitchell (Mitch) Hancock played mandolin from about 1897 until 1902. He often played on River Boats in New Orleans and recorded for the Edison Label. Billy's father worked for the Southern Railway and his mother worked for Waxie Maxie's, a local record store chain, and other record stores. The records his mother brought home from work, primarily rhythm and blues from the late 1940s, played a large and influential role in his musical development.

==Career==
Hancock began his career playing in bands around Washington, D.C., while still a teenager. After graduating from high school, he played with bands in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] before returning to the Washington area. In 1968, he moved to [[Baltimore]] to attend the [[Peabody Conservatory]], and continued to play in bands in the Baltimore area.

In the early 1970s, Hancock began a collaboration with [[Danny Gatton]] and they formed Danny and the Fat Boys with Hancock (bass, vocals), Gatton (guitars), and Dave Elliott (drums, vocals). In 1975, the group released ''American Music'' on a label owned by Hancock and his brother. The album's title was taken from a rhythm and blues song Hancock had written. It was later re-issued on CD.

In 1978, Hancock recorded four rockabilly songs under the name Billy Hancock and the Tennessee Rockets for [[Ripsaw Records]], a small independent label. He continued to record rockabilly for Ripsaw under that name for two years. Ripsaw released four singles during that time and licensed those and other titles to larger labels both in the U.S. and France. It is these rockabilly recordings for which Hancock is known internationally.

In 1983, Hancock recorded another rockabilly record, "Hey! Little Rock And Roller", that was released in France on the Big Beat Label. Later that year, he returned to Ripsaw to record various rock and roll songs, six of which Ripsaw released in 1985. All of the Ripsaw material was later released on CDs by Finnish Bluelight Records.

Throughout his career, Hancock played in backing bands for prominent musicians, including [[Fats Domino]], [[Gene Vincent]], blues guitarist [[Roy Buchanan]], rockabilly [[Charlie Feathers]], [[the Clovers]], [[Amos Milburn]], and country musicians [[Dottie West]] and [[Jean Shepard]]. He co-produced and played guitar on [[Tex Rubinowitz]]'s rockabilly song "Hot Rod Man."

In 2002, Hancock and his brother the television director, Dale Hancock founded Turkey Mountain Records, an independent record label. The label was formed to find and promote talented artists of all genres who, for whatever reasons, have been ignored by other record labels. Their Archival Series re-released material on artists of the past whose works have been unavailable until now. Turkey Mountain Records' roster of artists included: Danny Gatton, The British Walkers (featuring Roy Buchanan), Bobbie (The Kid) Howard with Link Wray and The Ray Men, Charlie Feathers, The Fallen Angels, and Billy Hancock himself.

In 2005, the [[Washington Area Music Association]] WAMA awarded Hancock a Special Recognition Award for his 40-plus years as a vocalist, musician, songwriter, producer, promoter, and label owner. In 2006, WAMA presented him with two "Wammie" awards for 2005 Roots Rock Vocalist and Roots Rock Recording.  In 2012, WAMA presented Hancock as one of "The Fallen Angels" a special recognition award.

In 2010, Hancock was inducted into the Southern Legends Hall of Fame. He is already a member of three other International Halls of Fame.

Hancock was also the television host for ''American Music'' in Arlington, Virginia, where he interviewed and showcased songwriters and a music historian.

He was also a member of the resurrected art rock group from the sixties, The Fallen Angels.

On 4 November 2012 Hancock was inducted into The Northern Virginia Blues Society, Blues Hall of Fame in Manassas, Va.

==Life and career==
[[File:Billy Joe Royal.png|200px|thumb|left|Royal in 1966]]
Born in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], to Clarence and Mary Sue Smith Royal, and raised in [[Marietta, Georgia]], Royal performed at the Georgia Jubilee in Atlanta during his teens. He formed his own [[rock and roll]] band, and became a local [[celebrity|star]] at the Bamboo Ranch in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where his singing style was influenced by African-American performers, including [[Sam Cooke]].<ref name=allmusic/>
Royal was a friend of performer and [[songwriter]]  [[Joe South]], and recorded what was intended as a [[demo (music)|demo]] of South's song "[[Down in the Boondocks (song)|Down in the Boondocks]]". The recording was heard at [[Columbia Records]], who offered Royal a singing contract in 1965 and released his version of the song, produced by South.<ref name=allmusic/> "Down in the Boondocks" remained his best-known song, reaching number 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicvf.com/song.php?id=4964|title=Down in the Boondocks (song by Billy Joe Royal) ••• Music VF, US & UK hits charts|website=Musicvf.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref> and number 38 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/12029/billy-joe-royal/|title=BILLY JOE ROYAL &#124; full Official Chart History|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref>

He followed up his initial success with the [[single (music)|singles]] "[[I Knew You When (Billy Joe Royal song)|I Knew You When]]" (Top 20, 1965) and "[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]" (1967), also written and produced by Joe South.  Another South composition, "[[Yo-Yo (Billy Joe Royal song)|Yo-Yo]]", just missed the top 40 in Canada and charted poorly in the U.S. when Royal released it in 1967, but a later remake by [[The Osmonds]] was a much greater success.  His 1969 single, "[[Cherry Hill Park]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=billyjoeroyal.com>{{cite web|title=Billy Joe Royal|url=http://billyjoeroyal.com/|publisher=Billyjoeroyal.com/|access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref>  In the 1970s his recording of "Heart's Desire" gained popularity among [[Northern soul]] enthusiasts and was regularly played in Northern soul nightclubs.<ref name="TooDarnSoulful">{{cite book | title=Too Darn Soulful – The Story of Northern Soul | publisher=Robson Books | author=Nowell, David | year=1999 | location=London | pages=118 | isbn=1-86105-270-7}}</ref>

By the late 1970s, Royal had become a regular performer in [[Las Vegas]], and also appeared as an actor in movies and on television.  His last hit on the US pop charts was in 1978, when his version of "[[Under the Boardwalk]]" became a minor hit.  However, he reinvented himself in the 1980s as a mainstream [[country music|country]] star, and had his first hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] in 1985 with "[[Burned Like a Rocket]]", released on the [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] label.  His other country hits included "[[I'll Pin a Note on Your Pillow]]" (1987), "[[Tell It Like It Is (song)|Tell It Like It Is]]", and "[[Till I Can't Take It Anymore]]" (both 1989).  His successes on the country charts continued until the early 1990s.<ref name=allmusic/>

Royal experienced a second comeback during the 2000s due to regular airplay on Country and Classic radio stations.  His music was further exposed to younger generations through a movement known as [[The Beat Army]], an online music forum based on Facebook which is operated by author and music producer [[Paul Collins (musician)|Paul Collins]].  Royal continued to tour regularly, performing concerts at casinos, music festivals, and clubs in North America, Japan, and throughout Europe.  His set lists included a mixture of songs representing multiple genres from the 1960s onwards.  He also played Robert Ally in the [[Indie film|indie]] Western film, ''Billy the Kid'' (2013), co-starring country singer [[Confederate Railroad|Cody McCarver]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Forbesfilms.com|title=Billy the Kid|url=http://forbesfilms.com|work=A Cold Day in Hell|access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2935888/ |title=''Billy the Kid'' (2013)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=August 24, 2013}}</ref>

'''William Lance Swan''' (born May 12, 1942)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=2427}}</ref> is an American [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter, best known for his 1974 single "[[I Can Help]]".

==Biography ==
Swan was born in [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]], United States.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  As a child, he learned drums, piano and guitar, and began writing songs. His first big break was in 1962 when [[Clyde McPhatter]] recorded "[[Lover Please]]", a song written by Swan when he was in a local band called Mirt Mirly & the Rhythm Steppers, who had first recorded the song on [[Bill Black]]'s Louis label.<ref name="amg">{{cite web|first = Steve | last = Huey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-swan-mn0000768584/biography |title=Billy Swan &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=May 12, 1942 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref> McPhatter's version quickly became a No. 7 [[Billboard Hot 100|pop hit]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Swan moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to work with Black,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> but this was cut short with Black's illness and subsequent death in 1965.  It was rumored that Swan worked as a security guard at [[Graceland]]. While he was friends with one of the security guards he never worked at Graceland. He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which enabled him to write hit [[country music|country]] songs for numerous artists, including [[Conway Twitty]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Mel Tillis]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  In 1969, Swan first took on the role of record producer, producing [[Tony Joe White]]'s [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit "[[Polk Salad Annie]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Swan also played bass guitar for [[Kris Kristofferson]] and then signed a solo recording deal with [[Monument Records]].<ref name="amg"/>

{{quote box|quote="Here's this guy who really doesn't sing very well at all and not only has he now made more good albums than [[Three Dog Night]] and the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] combined, but they keep getting better. Except maybe for '[[Blue Suede Shoes]]' there are no waste cuts this time, and no mediocrities either. The well-meaning optimism and the insecure persona mesh perfectly, and the tunes are pleasurable throughout, whether he stole them from the [[Sun Records|Sun]] catalogue or wrote them himself."|source=—Review of ''Billy Swan'' in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: S|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=S&bk=70|access-date=March 12, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

Swan moved to Nashville in 1973 and cut his first album, ''I Can Help'' in early 1974, which included the track "Lover Please". The album budget was only $19,000, and had been declared, pre-release, by a music business professional hired by the president of Monument Records, Fred Foster, that there were no hits on the record. However, the single "[[I Can Help]]" proved this wrong, recorded at [[Young 'Un Sound]] in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> It was a [[rockabilly]] number that topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well as the US and Canadian country [[record chart|charts]] in 1974, also becoming a hit in many other countries.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Swan wrote the song on an RMI organ that [[Kris Kristofferson|Kristofferson]] and singer [[Rita Coolidge]] had bought for him as a wedding gift.<ref name="LarkinGE" /> However, the RMI organ wasn't used on the final recording, contrary to popular belief, it was actually a portable [[Farfisa]] from [[Bobby Emmons]], a Memphis session musician.<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'">{{Cite web |title=Billy Swan 'I Can Help' |url= https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/billy-swan-can-help |access-date= 2023-03-03 |website= www.soundonsound.com |archive-url=  https://web.archive.org/web/20230303012157/https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/billy-swan-can-help |archive-date= 2023-03-03}}</ref> Swan recalls, "Chip set up a vocal mic, I stood in front of the organ, and what you hear was captured on the second take."<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> The lyrics were written in under twenty minutes.<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> It was recorded in two takes (without [[overdub]]s), and co-produced/engineered by the owner of the recording studio, [[Chip Young]].<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> The label pushed for "The Ways of a Woman in Love" to be the single, but Young insisted the hit was "I Can Help".<ref name="Billy Swan 'I Can Help'"/> However, other albums with Monument, [[A&M Records|A&M]], and [[Epic Records|Epic]] did not have nearly the success of "I Can Help".<ref name="amg" />

In 1979, Swan traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place March 2–4, alongside [[Stephen Stills]], the [[CBS Jazz All-Stars]], the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Weather Report]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], [[Mike Finnegan]], Kris Kristofferson, Rita Coolidge, and [[Billy Joel]], plus an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata Güines]], and [[Orquesta Aragón]]. His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary ''Havana Jam '79''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Swan continued to tour as a member of Kristofferson's band and recorded with [[Randy Meisner]] of [[The Eagles]]. In 1986, he entered a California studio (Bench Records) as part of a band called [[Black Tie (band)|Black Tie]] and along with Meisner, Jimmy Griffin ([[Bread (band)|Bread]]), [[David Kemper]] (drummer), David Miner, and David Mansfield recorded an album called ''When the Night Falls''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  He recorded another solo album, ''Like Elvis Used to Do'' in 2000, and another Black Tie-style album with Meisner and Charlie Rich, Jr. billed as "Meisner, Swan & Rich".<ref name="amg"/> {{As of|2005}}, Swan remained a backing singer and [[session musician]].

'''Bobby Darin''' (born '''Walden Robert Cassotto'''; May 14, 1936&nbsp;– December 20, 1973)<ref name="LarkinGE"/> was an American musician, songwriter, and actor. He performed [[jazz]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock and roll]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[country music]].

Darin started his career as a songwriter for [[Connie Francis]]. In 1958, Darin co-wrote and recorded his first million-selling single, "[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]", which was followed by Darin's own song "[[Dream Lover]]", then his covers of "[[Mack the Knife#Popular song|Mack the Knife]]" and "[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]", which brought him worldwide fame. In 1962, Darin won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his first film, ''[[Come September]]'', co-starring his first wife, actress [[Sandra Dee]].

During the 1960s, Darin became more politically active and worked on [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s Democratic presidential campaign. He was present at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles at the time of [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy's assassination]] in June 1968. That same year, Darin discovered the woman who had raised him was his grandmother, not his mother as he thought, and learned that the woman he thought was his sister was actually his mother. Those events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion.<ref name = "Starr">{{cite book|page=167|title=Bobby Darin: A Life|first=Michael Seth|last=Starr|year=2011|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=9781589795983}}</ref>

Although Darin made a successful comeback (in television) in the early 1970s, his health was beginning to fail due to a weak heart. The knowledge of Darin's vulnerability had always spurred him on to use his musical talent while still young. Darin died in 1973 at the age of 37 in a hospital recovery room after having open heart surgery in Los Angeles.<ref name=ergmtkf>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oatVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2381%2C5298583 |work=Eugene register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Bobby Darin of 'Mack the Knife' fame dies |date=December 21, 1973 |page=1A}}</ref><ref name="NYT-Obit">{{Cite news |date=December 21, 1973 |title=Bobby Darin, Pop Singer, Dies at 37 |language=en-US |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/21/archives/bobby-darin-pop-singer-dies-at-37-young-man-in-a-hurry-became-adult.html |access-date=December 24, 2020 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=dnobt>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sctSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cX8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6822%2C5331297 |work=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |agency=wire services |title=Bobby Darin dead at 37 |date=December 20, 1973 |page=A2}}</ref><ref name=sbddscd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_KdYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qvgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2581%2C1263633 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Singer Bobby Darin dies |date=December 20, 1973 |page=2}}</ref>

==Early life==
Darin was born Walden Robert Cassotto in [[East Harlem]], New York City, on May 14, 1936, to Vanina Juliette "Nina" Cassotto (born November 30, 1917).<ref>''Dream Lovers'', pp. 9–10</ref>  Because his mother was only 18 at the time of his birth, Darin's maternal grandmother became his mother and Nina his older sister.<ref name = "Starr">{{cite book|page=167|title=Bobby Darin: A Life|first=Michael Seth|last=Starr|year=2011|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=9781589795983}}</ref>

Darin's maternal grandmother, Vivian "Polly" Fern Walden, (born in 1891) was of English, Danish and Norwegian ancestry<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/sources/9KF3-VK6|title=Pauline Vivian Fern Walden|website=[[FamilySearch]]|access-date=January 26, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.rodale.com/wcpe/USRodaleStore/pdf/roman_candle/1594860106CHP.pdf|title=Chapter One: The Hidden Child|publisher=Images.rodale.com|access-date=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310021822/http://images.rodale.com/wcpe/USRodaleStore/pdf/roman_candle/1594860106CHP.pdf|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/566767422.html?dids=566767422:566767422&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jan+09%2C+1960&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=He+Quit+Rockin%27-Now+He%27s+Rollin%27&pqatl=google|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312014037/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/566767422.html?dids=566767422:566767422&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jan+09%2C+1960&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=He+Quit+Rockin%27-Now+He%27s+Rollin%27&pqatl=google|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 12, 2013|title=He Quit Rockin' – Now He's Rollin'|date=January 9, 1960|publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com|access-date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> and had been a [[vaudeville]] singer before Darin's birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bobby-darin-brash-but-talented/|title=Bobby Darin: Brash, But Talented|work=CBS News|date=November 17, 2004 |access-date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> His maternal grandfather, Saverio Antonio "Big Sam Curly" Cassotto (born January 26, 1882), was of Italian descent. He had been a [[made man]] and "soldier" in the [[Genovese Crime Family]] as well as a close associate of [[Frank Costello]]. Sam served as a witness at Costello's 1914 wedding, though the relationship soured after he accused Costello of withholding money that was meant for Cassotto's family.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}} Sam Cassotto died from pneumonia in 1935 while in prison, a year before Darin's birth.

In 1968, when Darin was 32 and considering entering politics, Nina told him the truth, reportedly devastating Darin.<ref name="tv-bio">[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/229:106/1/Bobby_Darin.htm Biography: Bobby Darin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731140434/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/229%3A106/1/Bobby_Darin.htm|date=July 31, 2009}}, The Biography Channel.

Darin's career took off with a songwriting partnership, formed in 1955 with [[Don Kirshner]], whom he met at a [[candy store]] in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]].<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=628/9}}</ref> They wrote [[jingles]] and songs, beginning with "Bubblegum Pop".<ref name="Kirschner Times obituary">{{cite news|last1=Sisario|first1=Ben|title=Don Kirshner, Shaper of Hit Records, Dies at 76|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/arts/music/19kirshner.html|access-date=April 25, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 18, 2011}}</ref> In 1956, Darin's agent negotiated a contract with [[Decca Records]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The songs recorded at Decca had minimal commercial success.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

A member of the [[Brill Building]] gang of struggling songwriters, Darin was introduced to singer [[Connie Francis]], for whom he helped write several songs. They developed a romantic interest, but her father was not fond of Darin and did not approve of the relationship, and the couple split up. At one point, Darin wanted to elope immediately; Francis has said that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref name=":2">Autobiography ''Who's Sorry Now'' by Connie Francis</ref>

Darin left Decca to sign with [[Atlantic Records]]' [[Atco Records|Atco subsidiary]], where he wrote and arranged music for himself and others. Songs Darin recorded, such as [[Harry Warren]]'s "I Found a Million Dollar Baby", were sung in an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] style, which did not suit Darin's personality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Guided by Atlantic's star-maker [[Ahmet Ertegun]], Darin's career finally took off in 1958 when he recorded "[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Darin co-wrote the song with radio D.J. [[Murray the K|Murray Kaufman]] after a phone call from Kaufman's mother, Jean, a frustrated songwriter. Her latest song idea was: "Splish, Splash, Take a Bath". Both Kaufman and Darin felt the title was lackluster, but Darin, with few options, said: "I could write a song with that title." Within an hour, Darin had written "Splish Splash".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/article/stay-tuned-by-stan-cornyn-my-friend-bobby-darin|title =Stay Tuned By Stan Cornyn: My Friend Bobby Darin |website=Rhino.com |access-date=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The single, Darin's first successful foray into the rock and roll genre, sold more than a million copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Splish Splash Session - Session Notes |author=de Heer, Dik |publisher=Bobbydarin.net |date=April 10, 1958 |url=http://www.bobbydarin.net/sn_041058.html|access-date=September 3, 2010}}</ref><ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

He was also voted the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] that year, and "Mack the Knife" has since been honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]].

Darin followed "Mack" with "[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]", a jazzy English-language version of [[Charles Trenet]]'s [[French-language|French]] hit song "[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Both tracks were produced by Atlantic founders Ahmet and [[Nesuhi Ertegun]] with staff producer [[Jerry Wexler]] and they featured arrangements by Richard Wess.

The late-1950s success included Darin setting the all-time attendance record at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] nightclub in Manhattan and headlining at the major [[casino]]s in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].

=== 1960s ===
Darin's 1960 recording of "Artificial Flowers", a song by [[Sheldon Harnick]] and [[Jerry Bock]] from the Broadway musical ''[[Tenderloin (musical)|Tenderloin]]'' about the death of a child laborer, featured a jazzy, [[big band]] arrangement by Richard Behrke, that was in sharp contrast to its tragic lyrics.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdFon6m_I0g Artificial Flowers], from YouTube.</ref>

In the 1960s, Darin owned and operated, with [[Doris Day]]'s son [[Terry Melcher]], a music publishing and production company (TM Music/Trio). Darin signed [[Wayne Newton]] and gave him the song "[[Danke Schoen]]", which became Newton's breakout hit.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Darin also was a mentor to [[Roger McGuinn]], who worked for him at TM Music and played the 12-string guitar in Darin's nightclub band before forming [[the Byrds]]. Darin also produced [[Rosey Grier]]'s 1964 [[LP album|LP]] ''Soul City'', and ''Made in the Shade'' for [[Jimmy Boyd]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1962, Darin began to write and sing [[country music]], with hit songs including "[[Things (Bobby Darin song)|Things]]" (US No. 3/UK No. 2) (1962), "[[You're the Reason I'm Living]]" (US No. 3), and "18 Yellow Roses" (US No. 10).

Darin performed the opening and closing songs on the soundtrack of the 1965 [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[That Darn Cat!]]''.

==Acting career==
[[File:Red Skelton Bobby Darin Red Skelton Show 1965.JPG|thumb|180px|left|"Deadeye" and Darin in a 1965 ''[[Red Skelton]] Show'' skit]]
In the fall of 1959, Darin played "Honeyboy Jones" in an early episode of [[Jackie Cooper]]'s [[CBS]] military sitcom/drama ''[[Hennesey]]''. That same year, he became the only actor ever to have been signed to five major Hollywood [[film studio]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} Darin wrote music for several films in which he appeared.

Darin's first major film, ''[[Come September]]'' (1961), was a teenager-oriented romantic comedy with [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] and featuring 18-year-old actress [[Sandra Dee]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> They met during the production of the film and they soon married on December 1, 1960.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Dee gave birth to a son, Dodd Mitchell Darin (also known{{clarify|by whom? date=September 2020|date=April 2024}} as Morgan Mitchell) on December 16, 1961.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dodd Darin - Biography |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1194245/bio/ |access-date=2024-05-13 |website=IMDb |language=en-US}}</ref> Dee and Darin made a few films together with moderate success, such as ''[[If a Man Answers]]'' (1962), and ''[[That Funny Feeling]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bobby Darin Films -- bobbydarin.net |url=https://www.bobbydarin.net/bdfilms.html |access-date=2024-05-13 |website=www.bobbydarin.net}}</ref>

In 1963, Darin was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as a [[post-traumatic stress disorder|shell-shocked]] soldier in ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' Throughout his acting career, Darin appeared alongside a series of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] leading men [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Steve McQueen]], and [[Gregory Peck]].<ref name=":0" /> 

In October 1964, Darin appeared as a wounded ex-convict who is befriended by an orphan girl in "The John Gillman Story" episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Wagon Train]]'' [[Western (genre)|western]] television series.

==Later years==

=== Politics ===
{{quote box | quote="Now my attitude is very simple: I must do what artistically pleases me."|source=Bobby Darin, 1967 ''[[Pop Chronicles]]'' interview<ref name=popc/>}}
Darin became more politically active as the 1960s progressed, and his musical output became more "[[folk music|folksy]]". In 1966, Darin had a hit with folksinger [[Tim Hardin]]'s "[[If I Were a Carpenter (song)|If I Were a Carpenter]]",<ref name="popc" /> securing a return to the [[Top 40|Top 10]] after a two-year absence.<ref name="LarkinGE" />

Darin traveled with [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and worked on the politician's 1968 presidential campaign. He was with Kennedy on June 4, 1968, the day he traveled to Los Angeles for the California primary, and Darin was also at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] later that night when Kennedy was assassinated. That event, combined with learning about his true parentage, had a deep effect on Darin, who spent most of the next year living in seclusion in a trailer near [[Big Sur]]. In 1968–69, he wrote and recorded two albums that covered issues such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], poverty, the [[Vietnam War]] and the death of RFK – ''[[Bobby Darin Born Walden Robert Cassotto]]'' (1968) and ''[[Commitment (Bobby Darin album)|Commitment]]'' (1969).<ref>{{Cite web |title=About |url=https://www.bobbydarin.com/about |access-date=2024-05-13 |website=Bobby Darin |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Direction Records ===
Returning to Los Angeles in 1969, Darin started his own record label which was titled Direction Records, putting out folk and protest music. Darin wrote "Simple Song of Freedom" in 1969, which, in an interesting turn of events, was first recorded by Tim Hardin and the song became Hardin's best-selling record. It reached #48 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top 100 Singles list in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.6023.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - August 30, 1969}}</ref> Also in Canada, a version by ''Buckwheat'' reached #52.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.7700.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - May 6, 1972}}</ref> Darin himself sang the song "live" on several television variety shows.

Of his first Direction album, Darin told the press, "The purpose of Direction Records is to seek out statement-makers....The album is solely {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} compositions designed to reflect my thoughts on the turbulent aspects of modern society."<ref>{{cite book |last1=DiOrio |first1=Al |title=Borrowed Time: The 37 years of Bobby Darin |date=1981 |publisher=Running Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0894711113 |page=181}}</ref>[[File:1972 Bobby Darin show.JPG|thumb|''Dean Martin Presents: The Bobby Darin Amusement Company'', L-R: [[Dick Smothers]], [[Tom Smothers]], and Bobby Darin as the [[Marx Brothers]] (1972) ]]Darin was struggling with his finances as his music career was dwindling. Darin's venture into protest music was not received favorably and generated little or no profits. In late 1969, Darin sold his songs, his record label (Direction Records), and publishing company (TM Music), losing the copyright to his own music and eventually, their worth. The company Darin sold them to went bankrupt. It was believed that during his final days, Darin was still trying to gain back the rights to his music.<ref name=":0" />

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Darin proposed a self-directed and written film ''The Vendors'' (1970), about the life of a folk singer.<ref>{{Citation |last=Darin |first=Bobby |title=The Vendors |type=Drama |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464846/ |access-date=2024-05-13 |others=Mariette Hartley, Donnelly Rhodes, Gary Wood}}</ref> However, the production left him broke and was not released, which led Darin to return to music. In spite of his declining health, Darin's last venture was spent performing live, while undergoing heart surgery and receiving post-treatment medication.<ref name=":0" /> He released his last album, self-titled (1972) on [[Motown]].

=== NBC Variety shows ===
Beginning on July 27, 1972, Darin starred in his own television variety show on NBC, ''Dean Martin Presents: The Bobby Darin Amusement Company'', which ran for seven episodes ending on September 7. Beginning on January 19, 1973, Darin starred in a similar show on NBC called ''The Bobby Darin Show''. That show ran for 13 episodes, ending on April 27. Darin subsequently made television guest appearances and remained a top draw.<ref name="Las Vegas">{{cite web | url=http://www.bobbydarin.net/bdlasvegas.html | title=Bobby in Las Vegas 1960's and 1970's | access-date=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Sandra Dee">{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114698,00.html|date=March 18, 1991|access-date=August 16, 2012|volume=35|number=10|first=Sandra|last=Dee|title=Learning to Live Again: A Former Teen Queen Shakes Free of Her Humiliating Past to End Years of Self-Hate and Loneliness|journal=People Magazine|archive-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919051139/https://people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114698,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Style and influence ==
Darin was on par with [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. In 1960, Darin infamously told [[Life (magazine)|Life]] magazine that he wanted to be established as a legend by the age of 25.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alexander |first=Shana |date=January 11, 1960 |title='I want to be a legend by 25,' says hit Singer Bobby Darin, 23, who has big ambitions and prospects to match |journal=Life Magazine |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=49}}</ref> Darin's off-the-cuff statements generated a rivalry and playful banter between Sinatra and himself.<ref name=":1" /> Sinatra released a cover version of "Mack the Knife" on the 1984 album ''[[L.A.

Darin and [[Elvis Presley]] were notable friends and teen idols in the 1950s. On occasion, Presley would sneak into Darin's concerts and watch him perform.<ref name=":0" />

In his short life, Darin explored all genres of music, such as pop, jazz, country, and folk music. In a 1988 Rolling Stone interview, [[Neil Young]] confessed: "I used to be pissed off at Bobby Darin because he changed styles so much. Now I look at him and I think he was a fucking genius."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Henke |first=James |date=1988-06-02 |title=Interview: Neil Young |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/interview-neil-young-79380/ |access-date=2024-05-13 |magazine=Rolling Stone |page=6 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Other interests==
Darin was an enthusiastic [[chess]] player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bobby Darin & Terry Kellman|publisher=bobbydarin.net |url=http://www.bobbydarin.net/kellman.html|access-date=January 8, 2011}}</ref> His television show included an occasional segment where he would explain a chess move.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bobby Darin's Last Shows| publisher = tvparty.com|url=http://www.tvparty.com/darin.html|access-date = January 8, 2011}}</ref> Darin arranged with the [[United States Chess Federation]] to sponsor a [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] tournament, which pitted him against the young Eastern Division champion Stephen Ryder, with the largest prize fund in history,<ref>{{cite web|title=Announcing the First Annual Bobby Darin International Chess Classic|publisher=bobbydarin.com|url=http://www.bobbydarin.com/chess73.htm| access-date = January 8, 2011}}</ref> but the event was canceled after Darin's death.<ref name="Sandra Dee" />

==Personal life==

=== Relationship with Connie Francis ===
In 1956, Darin and [[Connie Francis]] met after their manager, George Scheck arranged for Francis to record a song Darin had written. They were soon in what Darin's friends described as, "an intense romance". However, Francis's parents did not approve of Darin and one night after returning from a date, Francis found her bags packed and waiting for her on the front step. Darin proposed almost immediately. When her father found out about the engagement, he stormed into the rehearsals of ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' with a gun and threatened to shoot Darin, who managed to escape out of a window. Darin and Francis talked briefly after the show, but parted ways.<ref name=":2" /> Over a four-month period in 1956, the two maintained a secret correspondence involving love letters. Darin kept the letters until his death, and the letters were auctioned. They were returned to Francis later in life.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nolasco |first=Stephanie |date=2018-02-08 |title=Connie Francis reflects on her romance with Bobby Darin before his untimely death |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/connie-francis-reflects-on-her-romance-with-bobby-darin-before-his-untimely-death |access-date=2024-05-14 |website=Fox News |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the following years, they saw each other several times while appearing on the same television shows but were never romantically involved again. In 1960, Francis heard on the radio that Darin had married Sandra Dee &mdash; just as she and her father were driving through the [[Lincoln Tunnel]]. Francis later wrote: "I wished that somehow God would cause the Hudson River to come gushing in and entrap us in that tunnel." Francis has said that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref name=":2" />

==Health==
Darin had poor health throughout his life. Darin was frail as an infant and, beginning at age eight, had recurring bouts of [[rheumatic fever]] that left him with a seriously weakened heart.<ref name="Sandra Dee"/> Darin was well aware that he might not live long, and lived his life accordingly.

During his first [[heart surgery]] in January 1971, Darin had two [[artificial heart valve|artificial valves]] implanted, then spent most of that year recovering from the surgery.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} In the last few years of his life, Darin was often administered oxygen during and after his performances on stage and screen.<ref name=":0" />

==Death==
In 1973, after failing to take antibiotics to protect his heart before a dental visit, Darin developed [[sepsis]], an overwhelming systemic infection, which further weakened his body and affected one of his heart valves. On December 11 of that year, Darin checked himself into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in Los Angeles for another round of open-heart surgery to repair the two artificial heart valves he had received in January 1971.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> On the evening of December 19, a four-person surgical team worked for over six hours to repair Darin's damaged heart. Shortly after the surgery ended in the early morning hours of December 20, Darin died in the recovery room without regaining consciousness. He was only 37 years old.<ref name=ergmtkf/><ref name="NYT-Obit" />

Darin's last wish in his will was that his body be donated to science for [[medical research]], and Darin's remains were transferred to the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] shortly after his death.<ref name="NYT-Obit" />

==Legacy==
In 1990, Darin was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], with singer and close friend [[Paul Anka]] announcing the honor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/bobby-darin/ |title=Bobby Darin: inducted in 1990 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum | publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=August 17, 2015}}</ref> In 1999, Darin was voted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

Songwriter [[Alan O'Day]] alluded to Darin and his recording of "Mack the Knife" in the song "[[Rock and Roll Heaven]]" (made a hit by [[the Righteous Brothers]]), a tribute to dead musicians, which O'Day wrote shortly after Darin's death.

On May 14, 2007, Darin was awarded a star on the [[Las Vegas Walk of Stars]] to honor his contribution to making Las Vegas the "Entertainment Capital of the World" and named him one of the twentieth century's greatest entertainers. Fans paid for the star. Darin also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

On December 13, 2009, at its 2010 [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony, the Recording Academy awarded Darin a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award.

===Biopic===
{{Main|Beyond the Sea (2004 film)}}
In 1986, director [[Barry Levinson]] intended to direct a film based on Darin's life and had begun [[preproduction]] on the project by early 1997. He abandoned the project, the rights to which were subsequently bought by actor [[Kevin Spacey]], along with Darin's son, Dodd. The resultant biopic, ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'', starred Spacey as Darin, with the actor using his own singing voice for the musical numbers. The film covers much of Darin's life and career, including his marriage to [[Sandra Dee]], portrayed by [[Kate Bosworth]].

''Beyond the Sea'' opened at the 2004 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. Although Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee, and Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey's work and the film was strongly promoted by the studio, ''Beyond the Sea'' received mixed-to-poor reviews upon wide release, and box office results were disappointing. Spacey, however, was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor—Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but the award that year went to [[Jamie Foxx]] for his portrayal of Darin's musical contemporary [[Ray Charles]].

===Musical===
In September 2016, ''[[Dream Lover: The Bobby Darin Musical]]'' had its world premiere at [[Sydney Lyric]] Theatre, Australia. The production featured the story of Darin with an 18-piece big band. Darin was played by [[David Campbell (Australian musician)|David Campbell]].<ref name = DailyTele-Darin>{{cite news|url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/singer-david-campbell-to-channel-50s-crooner-bobby-darin-in-new-musical/news-story/2564ec048441a3d526b084208bd79ad5|title = Singer David Campbell to channel 50s crooner Bobby Darin in new musical|newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|first = Briana|last = Domjen|date = April 3, 2016|access-date = October 29, 2018}}</ref> Darin had an unusual upbringing, being raised by a "mother" who was actually his grandmother and alongside a "sister" who was actually his mother, a fact Darin did not discover until he was 31 years old.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|title = Bobby Darin: A Life|first = Michael Seth|last = Starr|publisher = [[Taylor Trade Publications]]|year = 2004|page = 167|isbn = 9781589795983|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IUYCMSnVH-oC&pg=PA167}}</ref> Campbell grew up in a similar circumstance,<ref name = DailyTele-Darin /> leading Bobby's son Dodd Darin to describe Campbell as perfect for the role, stating, "You have to have lived something like that to understand it and [Campbell] has, and I think he can relate to my dad, he can relate to the pain."<ref name = ABC-Darin /> Campbell made similar observations, describing playing Darin as a "cathartic experience", and stating, "I feel like I'm healing things during this show."<ref name = ABC-Darin>{{cite news|title = David Campbell's family secret makes him perfect to play Bobby Darin, says Darin's son|first1 = Lesley|last1 = Robinson|first2 = Myles|last2 = Wearring|date = October 5, 2016|access-date = October 29, 2018|url = https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/family-secret-makes-david-campbell-perfect-to-play-bobby-darin/7902318|work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> The production was nominated in six categories in the [[18th Helpmann Awards]], including for [[Helpmann Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], with Campbell receiving the [[Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Musical]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2018/nominees-and-winners/musicals|title = 2018 Helpmann Awards – Nominees and Winners (Musicals)|access-date = October 29, 2018|year = 2018|publisher = [[Helpmann Awards]]}}</ref>

'''Robert Lee Helms''' (August 15, 1933 – June 19, 1997) was an American [[Country music|country]] singer, who is best remembered for his 1957 [[Christmas music|Christmas hit]] "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]". Additionally, he had two other hit records from that year: "[[Fraulein (song)|Fraulein]]" and "[[My Special Angel]]".

==Life and career==
Robert Lee Helms was born in 1933 in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] (some sources say nearby [[Helmsburg, Indiana|Helmsburg]]), the son of Hildreth Esther (née Abram) and Fred Robert Helms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=Bobby Helms Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-helms-mn0000063722|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=15 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvFJDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Hildreth+Esther+Abram+Helms+and+Fred+Robert+Helms%22&pg=PA376|title=A Year of Indiana History - Book 1: 366 Indiana History Stories|first=Paul R.|last=Wonning|publisher=Mossy Feet Books|page=376|via=Google Books}}</ref> His family was musical. Helms began performing as a [[duet (music)|duo]] with his [[sibling|brother]], Freddie, before going on to a successful [[solo (music)|solo]] career in country music. In 1956, Helms made his way to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], where he signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Decca Records]], and achieved multiple successes the following year. His first [[single (music)|single]] in 1957, titled "[[Fraulein (song)|Fraulein]]", went to No. 1 on the country music [[record chart|chart]] and made it into the [[Top 40]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100#History|''Billboard'' Best Sellers in Stores]] chart. Later that same year, he released "[[My Special Angel]]", which also hit No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts and entered the [[Top 40|Top 10]] on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[pop music]] chart, peaking at No. 7. It sold over one million copies, earning a [[music recording certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd

His song "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]", which was released in the late fall of 1957, produced by Paul Cohen<ref>Decca Records</ref> was a big [[chart-topper|hit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2014/12/16/jingle-bell-rock-hoosier-bobby-helms/20477989/|author=Lindquist, David|title=''Jingle Bell Rock'' cemented legacy for Hoosier Bobby Helms|website=IndyStar.com|publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref> and was being played and danced to on [[Dick Clark]]'s teen dance show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' by mid-December of that year. It also re-emerged in four out of the next five years, and sold so well that it repeated each time as a top hit, becoming a Christmas classic still played today. (In 2016, it was rated radio's third most-played Christmas song, according to StationIntel).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideradio.com/all-christmas-stations-start-strategy-with-classics/article_b057fa36-bddf-11e6-8354-ffd2060f03d0.html|title=All-Christmas Stations Start Strategy With Classics.|website=Insideradio.com|date=9 December 2016 }}</ref> It took five years for the song to become a second million-seller for Helms.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/102 102]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/102}}</ref> It reached No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and spent 21 weeks on the [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2"/>  The [[gramophone record|record]] gained [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2"/> At the end of a television performance of the song toward the end of his life, Helms said, “I didn’t want to do the song when they first brought it to me, but now I'm sure glad I did.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPkheJRt_Q |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/UiPkheJRt_Q| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Jingle Bell Rock|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=March 2021}} [[American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[AllMusic]] list the writers of the song as Joseph Beal, Joseph Carlton, James Ross, and James Boothe.

Another record by Helms was "Schoolboy Crush", which was a hit in the UK. It was released in the United States on June 23, 1958, on Decca. The same song was then covered by UK teen star [[Cliff Richard]] about the same time as the UK release.

Helms continued touring and [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] for the next three decades. His pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Helms suffered from emphysema, asthma, diabetes, and stomach problems. He began wearing an eye patch after losing sight in his right eye. He was a longtime resident of [[Martinsville, Indiana]], until his death from complications from emphysema at the age of 63 on June 19, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1996 - 1997 |website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Brenda Mae Tarpley was born on December 11, 1944,<ref name=Dynamite /> in the charity ward of [[Grady Hospital]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to parents Annie Grayce (née Yarbrough; 1921–2006) and Ruben Lindsey Tarpley (1909–1953).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee Biography |url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/brenda-lee-biography |access-date=December 3, 2023 |publisher=PBS |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203094350/https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/brenda-lee-biography |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944 |title=Brenda Lee (b. 1944) |encyclopedia=New Georgia Encyclopedia |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=May 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526222803/https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944 |url-status=live }}</ref> She weighed 4 pounds 11 ounces at birth. Lee attended grade schools wherever her father found work, primarily between Atlanta and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]. Her family was poor. As a child, she shared a bed with her brother and sister in a series of three-room houses without running water. Life centered on her parents finding work, their family, and the [[Baptists|Baptist church]], where she began singing solos every Sunday.<ref name=Dynamite /><ref name=IMDB_TV>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456820/|title=Brenda Lee: Little Miss Dynamite|website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 11, 2019|archive-date=February 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208052516/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456820/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Her mother came from a [[working class]] family in [[Greene County, Georgia|Greene County]], Georgia.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Though her family did not have indoor plumbing until after her father's death, they had a battery-powered table radio that fascinated Brenda as a baby.<ref name=Dynamite /> Both her mother and sister remembered taking her repeatedly to a local candy store before she turned three. One of them would stand her on the counter and she would earn candy or coins for singing.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

== Career ==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2023}}
[[File:Brenda Lee with Elvis Presley in 1957.webp|thumb|Lee with [[Elvis Presley]] in 1957]]
===Child performer===
Lee's voice, face and stage presence won her wider attention from a young age. At age five, she won first place at her school's talent show contest, where she sang "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]". Her performance generated positive reviews, leading her to make regular appearances on local radio and television shows.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee |url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/brenda-lee |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum |language=en |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203094350/https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/brenda-lee |url-status=live }}</ref>

Her father died in 1953 (when she was 8 years old) in a construction accident, and by the time she turned ten, she was the primary breadwinner of her family through singing at events and on local radio and television shows.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=New Georgia Encyclopedia |language=en-US |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203094351/https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During that time, she appeared regularly on the country music show ''TV Ranch'' on [[WAGA-TV]] in Atlanta; she was so short, the host would lower a stand microphone as low as it would go and stand her up on a wooden crate to reach it. In 1955, Grayce Tarpley was remarried to Buell "Jay" Rainwater, who moved the family to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], Ohio, where he worked at the [[Jimmie Skinner]] Music Center. Lee performed with Skinner at the record shop on two Saturday programs broadcast over Newport, Kentucky, radio station [[WNOP (AM)|WNOP]]. The family soon returned to Georgia, but this time to [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], and Lee appeared on the show ''The Peach Blossom Special'' on [[WJAT|WJAT-AM]] in [[Swainsboro, Georgia|Swainsboro]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee |url=https://www.classicbands.com/brendalee.html |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=www.classicbands.com |archive-date=January 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125043111/http://www.classicbands.com/brendalee.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===National exposure and stardom===
Lee's breakthrough came in February 1955, when she turned down $30 ($334 in 2022 value<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 19, 2008 |title=Consumer Price Index Data from 1913 to 2022 {{!}} US Inflation Calculator |url=https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/ |access-date=November 28, 2022 |website=www.usinflationcalculator.com |language=en-US |archive-date=September 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922120528/https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/ |url-status=live }}</ref>) to appear on a Swainsboro radio station to see [[Red Foley]] and a touring promotional unit of his ABC-TV program ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in Augusta. An Augusta [[disc jockey]] persuaded Foley to hear her sing before the show. Foley did and agreed to let her perform "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]" on stage that night, unrehearsed. Foley later recounted the moments following her introduction:

{{Pull quote|I still get cold chills thinking about the first time I heard that voice. One foot started patting rhythm as though she was stomping out a prairie fire but not another muscle in that little body even as much as twitched. And when she did that trick of breaking her voice, it jarred me out of my trance enough to realize I'd forgotten to get off the stage. There I stood, after 26 years of supposedly learning how to conduct myself in front of an audience, with my mouth open two miles wide and a glassy stare in my eyes. <ref>Jim Wesley, ''Radio Express'' (2011), p. 58.</ref>

}}

On March 31, 1955, the 10-year-old made her network debut on ''Ozark Jubilee'' in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Although her five-year contract with the show was broken by a 1957 lawsuit brought by her mother and her manager,<ref>{{citation|first1=Brenda|last1=Lee|first2=Robert K.|last2=Oermann|first3=Julie|last3=Clay|title=Little Miss Dynamite: the Life and Times of Brenda Lee|publisher=Hyperion|year=2002|isbn=0-7868-8558-0|url=https://archive.org/details/littlemissdynami00bren}}</ref> she nevertheless made regular appearances on the program throughout its run.

Less than two months later, on July 30, 1956, [[Decca Records]] offered her a contract, and her first record was "Jambalaya", backed with "Bigelow 6-200". Lee's second single featured two novelty Christmas tunes: "I'm Gonna Lasso Santa Claus", and "Christy Christmas". Though she turned 12 on December 11, 1956, both of the first two Decca singles credit her as "Little Brenda Lee (9 Years Old)".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sexton |first=Paul |date=July 30, 2023 |title=Brenda Lee's 'Jambalaya': Little Miss Dynamite Debuts On The Bayou |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/brenda-lee-jambalaya-song/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=uDiscover Music |language=en-US |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203143508/https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/brenda-lee-jambalaya-song/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Neither of the 1956 releases charted, but her first issue in 1957, "[[One Step at a Time (Brenda Lee song)|One Step at a Time]]", written by Hugh Ashley, became a hit in both the pop and country fields. Her next hit, "Dynamite", coming out of a 4-foot 9-inch frame, led to her lifelong nickname, Little Miss Dynamite.<ref name=Dynamite />

Lee first attracted attention performing in country music venues and shows; however, her label and management felt it best to market her exclusively as a pop artist, the result being that none of her best-known recordings from the 1960s were released to country radio, and despite her country sound, with top Nashville session people, she did not have another country hit until 1969 with "[[Johnny One Time]]".{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

===Biggest successes: 1958–1966===
[[File:Brenda Lee - Cash Box 1960.jpg|thumb|Lee presented with a [[Music recording sales certification|Gold record]] for "I'm Sorry", cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'', August 27, 1960]]
Lee achieved her biggest success on the [[Record chart|pop charts]] in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s with [[rockabilly]] and [[rock and roll]]-styled songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brendalee.com/pages/biography.html |title=Brenda Lee: the Lady, the Legend|publisher=Brenda Lee Productions|access-date=April 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414094639/http://www.brendalee.com/pages/biography.html |archive-date=April 14, 2009}}</ref> Her biggest hits included "Jambalaya", "[[Sweet Nothin's]]" (No.&nbsp;4, written by country musician [[Ronnie Self]]), "I Want to Be Wanted" (No.&nbsp;1), "[[All Alone Am I]]" (No.&nbsp;3) and "[[Fool No. 1|Fool #1]]" (No.&nbsp;3). She had more hits with the more pop-based songs "[[That's All You Gotta Do]]" (No.&nbsp;6), "[[Emotions (Brenda Lee song)|Emotions]]" (No.&nbsp;7), "[[You Can Depend on Me (Louis Armstrong song)|You Can Depend on Me]]" (No.&nbsp;6), "[[Dum Dum (Brenda Lee song)|Dum Dum]]" (No.&nbsp;4), 1962's "[[Break It to Me Gently]]" (No.&nbsp;2), "[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]" (No.&nbsp;6), and "[[As Usual]]" (No.&nbsp;12). Lee's total of nine consecutive top 10 ''Billboard'' Hot 100 hits from "That's All You Gotta Do" in 1960 through "All Alone Am I" in 1962 set a record for a female solo artist that was not equaled until 1986 by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

The biggest-selling track of Lee's career was a [[Christmas]] song. In 1958, when she was 13, producer [[Owen Bradley]] asked her to record a new song by [[Johnny Marks]], who had had success writing Christmas tunes for country singers, most notably "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" ([[Gene Autry]]) and "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]" ([[Burl Ives]]). Lee recorded the song, "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]", in July with a prominent twanging guitar part by [[Hank Garland]] and raucous sax soloing by Nashville icon [[Boots Randolph]]. Decca released it as a single that November, but it sold only 5,000 copies, and did not do much better when it was released again in 1959.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/103 103]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/103}}</ref> However, over subsequent years, it eventually sold more than five million copies. Since 2017, the song has appeared at the end of each year on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, having spent (as of December 9, 2023) 54 weeks on the Hot 100, peaking at number 1 in 2023.
[[File:Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree - Billboard ad 1960.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ad for "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree", November 21, 1960]] 
In 1960, Lee recorded her [[signature song]], "[[I'm Sorry (Brenda Lee song)|I'm Sorry]]", however, the record  initially was withheld for months before its release due to concern that the 15-year-old Lee would not understand what she was singing about in the love song. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1960, reaching the #1 chart position in the U.S. and #12 in the U.K.<ref>{{Cite web |last=hanspostcard |date=December 2, 2019 |title=Billboard #1 Hits: #32: 'I'm Sorry'- Brenda Lee- July 18, 1960 |url=https://slicethelife.com/2019/12/02/billboard-1-hits-32-im-sorry-brenda-lee-july-18-1960/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=slicethelife |language=en |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203143508/https://slicethelife.com/2019/12/02/billboard-1-hits-32-im-sorry-brenda-lee-july-18-1960/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=tolsen |date=January 2, 2013 |title=Billboard Hot 100™ |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US |archive-date=December 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211227031046/https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was her first gold single and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/awards/3rd-annual-grammy-awards |title=3rd Annual Grammy Awards |publisher=[[Grammy Awards]] |access-date=2024-06-18}}</ref> Even though it was not released as a country song, it was among the first big hits to use what was to become the [[Nashville sound]]&nbsp;– a string orchestra and [[legato]] harmonized background vocals. "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" was finally noticed in its third release a few months later, and sales snowballed; the song remains a perennial favorite each December and is the record with which she is most identified by contemporary audiences.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Molanphy |first=Chris |date=December 8, 2023 |title=Why Brenda Lee's "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" Is Finally No. 1 on the Billboard Charts |url=https://slate.com/culture/2023/12/brenda-lee-rockin-around-christmas-tree-billboard-100.html |access-date=June 28, 2024 |website=Slate}}</ref>

Her last top ten single on the pop charts in the United States (besides the reappearance each November–December since 2017 of "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree") was 1963's "[[Losing You (Brenda Lee song)|Losing You]]" (No.&nbsp;6). 

In 1964, "[[As Usual]]" reached No.&nbsp;12 in the US and No.&nbsp;5 in the UK and "[[Coming on Strong (song)|Coming on Strong]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;11 in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} Also in 1964, "[[Is It True (Brenda Lee song)|Is It True]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;17 in both the US and the UK. Featuring [[Big Jim Sullivan]] (guitar), [[Jimmy Page]] (guitar) and [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]] (drums), it was her only hit single recorded in [[London]], England, and was produced by [[Mickie Most]]. The slide guitar and background singers were overdubbed in Nashville. It was recorded at Decca Records' number two studio at their West Hampstead complex, as was the UK B-side, a version of Ray Charles' 1959 classic cut, "[[What'd I Say]]?", which was not released in North America.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee – Is It True / What'd I Say {{!}} Releases {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/350095-Brenda-Lee-Is-It-True-Whatd-I-Say |access-date=June 28, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>  "Is It True" was composed by noted British songwriting team [[Ken Lewis (songwriter)|Ken Lewis]] and [[John Carter (English musician)|John Carter]], who were also members of UK hitmakers the [[The Ivy League (band)|Ivy League]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Ivy League {{!}} Allmusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ivy-league-mn0000069393 |access-date=June 28, 2024 |website=Allmusic}}</ref>

===International fame===
[[File:Brenda-Lee and Peter Denton.jpg|thumb|Brenda Lee at the Granada, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], April 1962]]
Lee was popular in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] from early in her career. She performed on television in the UK in 1959, before she had achieved much pop recognition in the United States. Her first hit single in the UK was "[[Sweet Nothin's]]", which reached No.&nbsp;4 on the UK singles chart in the spring of 1960. She subsequently had a UK hit (in 1961) with "[[Let's Jump the Broomstick]]", a rockabilly number recorded in 1959, which had not charted in the United States, but reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=Bernstein />

Lee had two Top Ten hits in the UK that were not released as singles in her native country: the first, "[[Speak to Me Pretty]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 in May 1962 and was her greatest hit in the UK by chart placing, swiftly followed by "[[Here Comes That Feeling]]", which reached No.&nbsp;5 in the summer of 1962. The latter was issued as the B-side to "[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]" in the United States (which peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100); however, "Here Comes That Feeling" also made an appearance in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at No.&nbsp;89, despite its B-side status in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

In 1962, while touring [[West Germany]], Lee appeared at the [[Star-Club]], [[Hamburg]], with the Beatles as the opening act.<ref name=Bernstein /> Lee also had big hits in the UK with "[[All Alone Am I]]" (No.&nbsp;7 in 1963) and "[[As Usual]]" (No.&nbsp;5 in 1964).{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Lee first visited England for three days in April 1959 as a last-minute replacement on ''[[Oh Boy! (TV series)|Oh Boy!]]''. She first toured the UK in March and April 1962 with [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Sounds Incorporated]] (as her backing group), and she toured the country for a second time in March 1963, this time supported by [[the Bachelors]], [[Sounds Incorporated]], [[Tony Sheridan]], and [[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Lee also toured in [[Ireland]] in 1963 and appeared on the front cover of the Irish dancing and entertainment magazine ''Spotlight'' in April that year.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

After appearing at the annual [[Royal Variety Performance]] before [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[London Palladium]] on November 2, 1964, Lee toured [[UK|Britain]] again in November and December 1964, supported by (amongst others) [[Manfred Mann]], [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates]], [[the John Barry Seven]], [[Wayne Fontana]] & [[the Mindbenders]], [[Marty Wilde]], [[the Tornados]] and [[Heinz (singer)|Heinz Burt]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

=== 1970–1992 ===
[[File:Brenda Lee 1977.JPG|thumb|Lee in 1977]]
During the early 1970s, Lee re-established herself as a country music artist. In a 1996 [[memoir]], [[television producer]] Sam Lovullo stated that Lee's 1972 appearance on his [[variety show]] ''[[Hee Haw]]'' had been instrumental to her [[Comeback (publicity)|comeback]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lovullo |first1=Sam |last2=Eliot |first2=Marc |date=1996 |title=Life in the Kornfield: My 25 Years at ''Hee Haw'' |location=New York |publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group |isbn= 1-57297-028-6 |quote=Brenda Lee ... faded from the charts, until ''Hee Haw'' brought her back. Her appearance on our show was the key to reestablishing her career. |quote-page=126}}</ref> Lee earned a string of top ten hits in the United States on the country charts, the first of which was 1973's "[[Nobody Wins (Brenda Lee song)|Nobody Wins]]", which reached the top five that spring and became her last Top 100 pop hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;70. The follow-up, the [[Mark James (songwriter)|Mark James]] composition "[[Sunday Sunrise (song)|Sunday Sunrise]]", reached No.&nbsp;6 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]''{{'s}} Hot Country Singles chart that October. Other major hits included "[[Wrong Ideas]]" and "[[Big Four Poster Bed]]" (1974); and "Rock on Baby" and "[[She's My Rock|He's My Rock]]" (both 1975).

After a few years of lesser hits, Lee began another run at the top ten with 1979's "[[Tell Me What It's Like]]". Two follow-ups also reached the Top 10 in 1980: "[[The Cowgirl and the Dandy]]" and "[[Broken Trust]]" (the latter featuring vocal backing by [[the Oak Ridge Boys]]). A 1982 album, ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', featuring Lee along with [[Dolly Parton]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]], was a surprise hit, reaching the top ten on the U.S. country albums chart. Her last well-known hit was 1984's "[[Hallelujah, I Love Her So]]" in duet with [[George Jones]] (Lee sang this song individually before and released it in 1960 on ''[[This Is...Brenda]]''). In 1992, Lee recorded a duet ("You'll Never Know") with [[Willy DeVille]] on his album ''[[Loup Garou (album)|Loup Garou]]''.<ref name="digitaljournal.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/brenda-lee-announces-signing-with-webster-public-relations/article/490083|title=Brenda Lee announces signing with Webster Public Relations|date=April 11, 2017|access-date=April 21, 2017|archive-date=April 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422033910/http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/brenda-lee-announces-signing-with-webster-public-relations/article/490083|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 2000–2016: Autobiography and Country Music Hall of Fame ===
Lee's autobiography, ''Little Miss Dynamite: The Life and Times of Brenda Lee'', was published by Hyperion in 2002 ({{ISBN|0-7868-6644-6}}).<ref name="Dynamite" />

Lee's most recent album release was a gospel collection in 2007. She no longer tours and rarely performs. Since the millennium, she has been involved with her work for the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]]. On October 4, 2000, Lee inducted fellow country music legends [[Faron Young]] and [[Charley Pride]] into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} Lee is often called upon to announce the annual inductees to the Country Music Hall of Fame and then officially present them with their membership medallions at a special ceremony every year. The most recent inductees announced by Lee were [[Randy Travis]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and [[Fred Foster]] in 2016.<ref name="digitaljournal.com" />

'''Charles Hardin Holley''' (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959), known as '''Buddy Holly''', was an American singer, songwriter and musician who was a central and pioneering figure of mid-1950s [[rock and roll]]. He was born to a musical family in [[Lubbock, Texas]], during the [[Great Depression]], and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. Holly's style was country and western music which he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school.

Holly made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group Buddy and Bob with his friend [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]]. In 1955, after opening for [[Elvis Presley]] as part of the Louisiana Hayride's habit of seeking out local bands to add to the show, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. Subsequently, he played with Presley three times that year and his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when Holly opened for [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], he was spotted by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with [[Decca Records]].

Holly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by [[Owen Bradley]], who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like [[Patsy Cline]]. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], and recorded a demo of "[[That'll Be the Day]]", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to [[Brunswick Records]], which released it as a single credited to [[The Crickets]], a name chosen by the band to subvert Decca's contract limitations. It became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, "That'll Be the Day" topped the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|US]] and [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, "[[Peggy Sue]]".

The album ''[[The "Chirping" Crickets]]'', released in November 1957, reached number five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Holly made his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), famed session musician [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), and embarked on a tour of the mid-western US. After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper]], and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by [[Don McLean]] as "[[The Day the Music Died]]" in his song "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]".

During his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums.  This was unfounded considering he first saw Elvis with this line-up in Lubbock in 1955 when Holly was strictly a country music band. Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Brian May]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[the Hollies]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Marshall Crenshaw]], [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Elton John]]. Holly was among the first artists inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in 1986. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of 100 Greatest Artists in 2010. Holly was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=swieser@panolawatchman.com |first=Stella Wieser |date=2022-08-10 |title=Texas Country Music Hall of Fame announces 2022 inductees |url=https://www.panolawatchman.com/news/texas-country-music-hall-of-fame-announces-2022-inductees/article_359dcf74-16de-11ed-9286-4396dc593295.html |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=Panola Watchman |language=en}}</ref>

==Life and career==
===Early life and career (1936–1955)===
Charles Hardin Holley (spelled "-ey") was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], on September 7, 1936, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Odell "L.O." Holley (1901–1985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902–1990). His elder siblings were Larry (1925–2022),<ref>{{Cite news |last=Driggars |first=Alex |date=April 8, 2022 |title=Larry Holley, Eldest Brother of Buddy Holly, Dies at 96 |work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |url=https://www.lubbockonline.com/story/news/2022/04/08/larry-holley-eldest-brother-buddy-holly-dies-96/9516263002/}}</ref> Travis (1927–2016),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Travis Holley, One of Buddy's Brothers, Dies Thursday (Playbill by Kerns Blog) |url=http://lubbockonline.com/interact/blog-post/william-kerns/2016-12-02/travis-holley-one-buddys-brothers-passes-away-thursday |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806180712/http://lubbockonline.com/interact/blog-post/william-kerns/2016-12-02/travis-holley-one-buddys-brothers-passes-away-thursday |archive-date=August 6, 2017 |access-date=December 30, 2016 |website=lubbockonline.com}}</ref> and Patricia Lou (1929–2008).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Patricia Holley Obituary (2008) - Surrey Advertiser |url=https://www.legacy.com/amp/obituaries/surreyad/107400302 |website=www.legacy.com}}</ref> Holly was of mostly [[English Americans|English]] and Welsh descent and had small amounts of Native American ancestry as well.<ref>Buddy Holly: A Biography By Ellis Amburn pg. 10</ref> From early childhood, Holly was nicknamed "Buddy."{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=12}} During the Great Depression, the Holleys frequently moved residence within Lubbock; L.O. changed jobs several times. Buddy Holly was baptized a Baptist, and the family were members of the Tabernacle Baptist Church.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=12}}

The Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the bow so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=13}} During World War II, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, at his mother's urging, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a [[steel guitar]], but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought him an acoustic guitar from a local pawnshop, and he learned how to play it from Travis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=14}}

During his early childhood, Holly was influenced by the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Bob Wills]], and the [[Carter Family]]. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, Holly became friends with [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]], and the two played together, practicing with songs by [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[Johnnie & Jack]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=34}} They both listened to the radio programs ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]], ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], and ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. At the same time, Holly played with other musicians he met in high school, including [[Sonny Curtis]] and [[Jerry Allison]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|p=80|2007}} In 1952 Holly and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as Buddy and Jack in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Bob Montgomery, and they were billed as Buddy and Bob. They soon started performing on the ''Sunday Party'' show on [[KDAV]] in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=6|2003}} At that time, Holly was influenced by late-night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues (R&B). He would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier [[country and western]] influence with R&B.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}} We do know it wasn't until Holly saw Elvis in Lubbock that led him to follow the Presley example.

By 1955, after graduating from [[Lubbock High School]], Holly decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley perform live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holly opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, Holly had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from country and western to [[rock and roll]] due to seeing Presley's performances and hearing his music.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} In October, Stone booked Bill Haley & His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded [[Grand Ole Opry]] manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], who signed the band to [[Decca Records]] in February 1956.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|p=130|1997}} In the contract, Decca misspelled Holly's surname as "Holly", and from then on he was known as Buddy Holly, instead of his real name Holley.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

On January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by [[Owen Bradley]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=97}} He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} In April 1956, Decca released "[[Blue Days, Black Nights]]" as a single, with "Love Me" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for [[Faron Young]]. During the tour, they were promoted as Buddy Holly and the Two Tones, while later Decca called them Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} The label later released Holly's second single "Modern Don Juan", [[b-side|backed with]] "You Are My One Desire". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.{{sfn|Uslan|Solomon|1981|p=49}}

===The Crickets (1956–1957) ===
{{Main article|The Crickets}}
[[File:Buddy Holly & The Crickets publicity portrait - cropped.jpg|Buddy Holly and the Crickets in 1957 (top to bottom: Allison, Holly and Mauldin)|thumb]]
Holly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca, and inspired by the success of [[Buddy Knox]]'s "[[Party Doll]]" and [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s "[[I'm Stickin' with You]]", he visited [[Norman Petty]], who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist [[Joe B. Mauldin]], and rhythm guitarist [[Niki Sullivan]], he went to Petty's studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The group recorded a demo of "[[That'll Be the Day]]", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and [[Sonny Curtis]] had gone to see the film ''[[The Searchers]]'', starring [[John Wayne]], in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase "That'll be the day". This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians.<ref>Trzcinski, Matthew (February 10, 2022). [https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/john-wayne-movie-inspired-buddy-hollys-thatll-be-the-day.html/ "How a John Wayne Movie Inspired Buddy Holly's 'That'll Be the Day'"]. ''CheatSheet''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=February 24, 2013 |title=My brother, Buddy Holly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2cHUkUsoKo |access-date=May 23, 2024 |website=YouTube}}</ref> Now playing lead guitar, Holly achieved the sound he desired. Petty became his manager and sent the record to [[Brunswick Records]] in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name "Crickets." Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release "That'll Be the Day", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EAGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT101 |title=Buddy Holly: A Biography |date=April 22, 2014 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=9781466868564 |page=101 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

Impressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. "I'm Looking for Someone to Love" was the B-side; the single was credited to [[The Crickets]]. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, [[Coral Records]]. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=131}}

Norman Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys would be reluctant to play and promote multiple new records by the same artist, but would have no problem playing these same records if they were credited to different performers. Holly himself was unaware of this strategy; in a 1957 radio interview with Dale Lowery, Holly said, "We have three records going out right now. Of course, the first one was 'That'll Be the Day', the first one released. Then we have a new one out by The Crickets, called 'Oh Boy!' and 'Not Fade Away', and then there's one out, it's the same group but it's under my name -- I don't know why they did it that way, but it went out under my name -- called 'Peggy Sue' and 'Everyday'."<ref>Buddy Holly interviewed by Dale Lowery for KTOP radio (Topeka, Kansas), 1957.</ref> Holly's records were released with labels reading "Buddy Holly" ''or'' "The Crickets"; the band was never credited on records as "Buddy Holly ''and'' the Crickets" until 1962, when a compilation album was released.

"That'll Be the Day" was released on July 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with [[Irvin Feld]], who had noticed the band after "That'll Be the Day" appeared on the R&B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York City.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=16}} The band was booked to play at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] on August 16–22. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included "[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]]." By the end of their run at the Apollo, "That'll Be the Day" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=17}} Holly appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended [[The Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=18}}
[[File:That'll Be the Day ad - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' advertisement, August 3, 1957]] 
"That'll Be the Day" topped the [[Number-one hits of 1957 (United States)|US "Best Sellers in Stores"]] chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=19}} Three days prior, Coral released "[[Peggy Sue]]", backed with "[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]", with Holly credited as the performer. By October, "Peggy Sue" had reached number three on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop chart and number two on the R&B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as "Buddy Holly and the Crickets"{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=57}} (although never on records during Holly's lifetime).

In the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark.{{sfn|Norman|p=127|1996}} After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his relationship with Clark a temporary one.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in [[Oklahoma City]], where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} The resulting album, ''[[The "Chirping" Crickets]]'', was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, "[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]", with "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" on the B-side. The single reached number 10 on the pop chart and 13 on the R&B chart.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=57}} Holly and the Crickets performed "That'll Be the Day" and "Peggy Sue" on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on December 1, 1957. Following the appearance, Niki Sullivan left the group because he was tired of the intensive touring, and wished to resume his education. On December 29, Holly and the Crickets performed "Peggy Sue" on ''[[The Arthur Murray Party]]''.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=127}}

===International tours and split (1958)===
On January 8, 1958, Holly and the Crickets joined ''America's Greatest Teenage Recording Stars'' tour.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=128}} On January 25, Holly recorded "[[Rave On]]"; the next day, he made his second appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', singing "Oh, Boy!"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=128}} Holly departed to perform in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, on January 27, and then started a week-long tour of Australia billed as the ''Big Show'' with [[Paul Anka]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Jodie Sands]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=189}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lo |first=Ping |date=October 29, 2008 |title=The night I saw Buddy Holly and the Crickets... for free |url=http://abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/10/29/2404761.htm |access-date=March 27, 2020 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> In March, the band toured the United Kingdom, playing 50 shows in 25 days.<ref name="Buddy Holly UK Tour">{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk/tour/buddy-holly-and-the-crickets-march-1958/|title=Buddy Holly & The Crickets – March 1958 « American Rock n Roll The UK Tours}}</ref> The same month, his debut solo album, ''[[Buddy Holly (album)|Buddy Holly]]'', was released. Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's ''Big Beat Show'' tour for 41 dates. In April, Decca released ''[[That'll Be the Day (album)|That'll Be the Day]]'', featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nashville sessions.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=90}}

A new recording session in Clovis was arranged in May; Holly hired [[Tommy Allsup]] to play lead guitar. The session produced the recordings of "[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]" and "[[Heartbeat (Buddy Holly song)|Heartbeat]]." Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&B band, recording "Now We're One" and [[Bobby Darin]]'s "[[Early in the Morning (Bobby Darin song)|Early in the Morning]]."{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=91}}

During a visit to the offices of [[Peermusic|Peer-Southern]], Holly met [[María Elena Santiago]]. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Norman Petty had tried to dissuade Holly from marriage; he felt that it would disappoint Holly's public and damage his career.

Holly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the [[Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]]. Holly also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=281}}

Santiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of its habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274}} She and her aunt Provi Garcia, an executive in the Latin American music department at Peer-Southern, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=280}} The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.{{sfn|Laing|p=153|2010}}

In September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded "Reminiscing" and "Come Back Baby." During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ [[Waylon Jennings]]. Holly produced the single "Jole Blon" and "When Sin Stops (Love Begins)" for Jennings.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=155}} Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Holly and Santiago settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in [[Greenwich Village]], where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including "[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]" and "What to Do."{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274–278}} The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire.{{sfn|Lloyd Webber|2015}}

On October 21, 1958, Holly's final studio session was recorded at the [[Pythian Temple (New York City)|Pythian Temple]] on West 70th Street (now a luxury condominium). Known by Holly fans as "the string sessions", Holly recorded four songs for Coral in an innovative collaboration with an 18-piece ensemble composed of former members of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] (including saxophonist [[Boomie Richman]]) under the direction of [[Dick Jacobs]].

The four songs recorded during the {{frac|3|1|2}}-hour session were: 
*"True Love Ways" (written by Buddy Holly), 
*"[[Moondreams (Norman Petty song)|Moondreams]]" (written by [[Norman Petty]]), 
*"[[Raining in My Heart]]" (written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant) and 
*"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]" (written by Paul Anka).{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=276–278}}
These four songs were the only ones Coral ever mixed in stereo, but only "Raining in My Heart" was released that way (in 1959, on an obscure promotional LP titled ''Hitsville''). All four records otherwise received releases in mono. The original stereo mixes were consulted many years later for compilation albums.

Holly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager and split from Holly. The split was amicable and based on logistics: Holly had decided to settle permanently in New York, where the business and publishing offices were, and the Crickets preferred not to leave their home state.

===Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959)===
{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}

Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings's radio station in December 1958.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 51}} For the start of the [[Winter Dance Party]] tour, he assembled a band consisting of [[Waylon Jennings]] (electric bass), [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums).{{sfn|Corbin, Sky|2014}} Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959. Jennings stayed at Holly's apartment by [[Washington Square Park]] on the days prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the [[General Amusement Corporation|General Artists Corporation]], which organized the tour.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 58, 59}} They then traveled by train to Chicago to join the rest of the band.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 62}}

The Winter Dance Party tour began in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for [[frostbite]] to his toes (sustained while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} On February 2, before their appearance in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a four-seat [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] airplane for Jennings, Allsup, and himself, from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]]. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], via [[Fargo, North Dakota]], allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid an arduous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with [[Ritchie Valens]]. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, "That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life." Allsup later opened a restaurant/bar in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], called Heads Up Saloon.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Paul |date=June 24, 1988 |title=Hit parade |work=Chicago Tribune |id={{ProQuest|882608515}}}}</ref> Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to [[The Big Bopper|J.

The pilot, Roger Peterson, took off in inclement weather<!-- The meteorological conditions at the time of the aircraft's takeoff were not "a snowstorm" as previously stated here, but "Precipitation ceiling 3,000 feet (1,800 feet AGL), sky obscured; visibility 6 miles; scattered light snow; temperature {{convert|18|°F|°C|abbr=on}}; winds south 20 knots, gusts to 30 knots; altimeter setting 29.85 inches".

Buddy's brother Larry Holley said, "I got the full report from the Civil Aeronautics – it took me a year to get it, but I got it – and they had installed a new Sperry gyroscope in the airplane. The Sperry works different than any other gyro. One of them, the background moves and the plane stays like this [stationary], and in the other one the background stays steady and the plane moves, it works just backwards. He [the pilot] could have been reading this backwards... they were going down, they thought they were still climbing."

Shortly after 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on February 3, 1959, Holly, Valens, Richardson, and Peterson were killed when the aircraft crashed into a cornfield five miles northwest of Clear Lake shortly after takeoff. The three musicians, who were ejected from the fuselage upon impact, sustained severe head and chest injuries.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|1959}} Holly was 22 years old.

The report did not mention a gun belonging to Holly that was found by a farmer two months after the crash. Newspaper accounts of the gun discovery fueled rumors among fans that the pilot was somehow shot, causing the crash. Another curious finding at the crash was that Richardson's body was discovered nearly {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=off}} away from the crash while the others were found in or near the wreckage. However, an autopsy done at the request of Richardson's son in 2007 found no evidence to support the rumors. Dr. Bill Bass, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, stated that "There was no indication of foul play," and that Richardson "died immediately."<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 7, 2007 |title=Big Bopper rumours put to rest by autopsy |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/big-bopper-rumours-put-to-rest-by-autopsy-1.683130 |publisher=The Associated Press |via=CBC}}</ref>

[[File:Buddy holley headstone.jpg|thumb|right|Holly's headstone in the City of Lubbock Cemetery]]
Holly's funeral was held on February 7, 1959, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Lubbock. The service was officiated by Ben D. Johnson, who had presided at the Hollys' wedding just months earlier. The pallbearers were Jerry Allison, Joe B. Mauldin, Niki Sullivan, Bob Montgomery, and [[Sonny Curtis]]. Some sources say that Phil Everly, one half of [[The Everly Brothers]], was also pallbearer, but Everly said that he attended the funeral but was not a pallbearer.{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|p=347|2014}} Waylon Jennings was unable to attend because of his commitment to the still-touring Winter Dance Party. Holly's body was interred in the City of Lubbock Cemetery, in the eastern part of the city. Holly's headstone carries the correct spelling of his surname (Holley) and a carving of his [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar.{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|p=348–52|2014}}

Santiago watched the first reports of Holly's death on television. The following day, she suffered a miscarriage. Holly's mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. Because of Elena's miscarriage, in the months following the accident, some government authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims' names until after families are informed.{{sfn|Suddath|2009}} Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later told the ''Avalanche-Journal'', "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane."{{sfn|Kerns|2008}}

== Personal life ==
Holly married [[María Elena Holly|María Elena Santiago]], a New York record company receptionist, on August 15, 1958, at [[Tabernacle Baptist Church (Fort Worth)|Tabernacle Baptist Church]] in his hometown of Lubbock, Texas. In 1959, Santiago was pregnant with their first child, but suffered a miscarriage immediately after Holly's death. They had only been married for six months.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Pisula |first1=Theresa |last2=Lovelace |first2=Tommy |date=June 1, 2000 |title=Interview with Maria Elena Holly |url=https://www.houstontheatre.com/buddy2.html |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=HoustonTheatre.com}}</ref>

Peggy Sue Gerron was the inspiration behind Holly's hit song "Peggy Sue". Holly and Gerron had a flirtatious relationship, and Gerron had known Holly since her schooldays when she was dating drummer Jerry Allison. Gerron married Allison on July 22, 1958. The two newlywed couples had a shared honeymoon in [[Acapulco]], Mexico.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=April 11, 2012 |title=My love for Buddy Holly and how his death stopped us marrying - by the |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/my-love-for-buddy-holly-and-how-his-death-stopped-us-marrying-by-the-real-peggy-sue-6648204.html |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=Evening Standard |language=en}}</ref>

Holly's own marriage to Santiago was distant and tense, and the couple were supposedly headed for divorce. In late 1958, Holly had also encouraged Gerron to divorce Allison over his drunkenly behaviour, but she declined. The act of divorce went against her [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] beliefs (however, Gerron eventually did divorce Allison in 1965). In December 1958, Holly recorded a demo of one of his last songs "Peggy Sue Got Married"—about Gerron and Allison's marriage.<ref name=":0" />

==Image and style==
Holly's singing style was characterized by his [[vocal hiccup]]s, a technique he acquired after hearing Elvis do it in 1955 on the Hayride show, and his alternation between his [[Modal voice|regular voice]] and [[falsetto]].{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2001}} Holly's "stuttering vocals" were complemented by his [[Percussive fingerstyle|percussive guitar playing]], solos, [[Double stop|stops]], [[bent note]]s, and rhythm and blues [[chord progression]]s.{{sfn|Henderson|Stacey|p=296|2014}} He often strummed [[Downpicking|downstrokes]] that were accompanied by Allison's percussion.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}}

Holly bought his first [[Fender Stratocaster]], which became his signature guitar, at Harrod Music in Lubbock. His innovative playing style was characterized by its blending of chunky rhythm and high string lead work. Holly played his first 1954 Stratocaster until it was stolen during a tour stop in [[Michigan]] in 1957. To replace it, he purchased a 1957 model before a show in Detroit. Holly owned four or five Stratocasters during his career.{{sfn|Hunter|p=87|2013}}

At the beginning of their music careers, Holly and his group wore business suits. When they met the Everly Brothers, Don Everly took the band to Phil's Men's Shop in New York City and introduced them to [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League clothes]]. The brothers advised Holly to replace his old-fashioned glasses with [[horn-rimmed glasses]], which had been popularized by [[Steve Allen]].{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=144}} Holly bought a pair of glasses made in Mexico from Lubbock optometrist Dr. J. Davis Armistead. Teenagers in the United States started to request this style of glasses, which were later popularly known as "Buddy Holly glasses."{{sfn|Jones|p=175|2014}}

While Holly's other belongings were recovered immediately following his fatal plane crash, there was no record of his signature glasses being found. They were presumed lost until, in March 1980, they were discovered in a Cerro Gordo County courthouse storage area by Sheriff Gerald Allen. They had been found in the spring of 1959, after the snow had melted, and had been given to the sheriff's office. They were placed in an envelope dated April 7, 1959, along with the Big Bopper's watch, a lighter, two pairs of dice and part of another watch, and misplaced when the county moved courthouses. The glasses frames were returned to Santiago a year later, after a legal contest over them with his parents. They are now on display at the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas.<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 12, 1980 |title=Holly's glasses returned to family |work=The Beaver County Times |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19800312&id=UfsqAAAAIBAJ&pg=4079,2430645 |access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=March 22, 1981 |title=Eyeglasses returned |work=The Prescott Courier |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&dat=19810322&id=oZ5OAAAAIBAJ&pg=6240,5970296 |access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:WinterDanceParty.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the ill-fated "Winter Dance Party" tour]]

Buddy Holly left behind dozens of unfinished recordings&nbsp;— solo transcriptions of his new compositions, informal jam sessions with bandmates, and tapes demonstrating songs intended for other artists. The last known recordings, made in Holly's apartment in late 1958, were his last six original songs. In June 1959, Coral Records overdubbed two of them with backing vocals by the [[Ray Charles Singers]] and studio musicians in an attempt to simulate the established Crickets sound. The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, "[[Peggy Sue Got Married (song)|Peggy Sue Got Married]]"/"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]." The new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly demos, using the same studio personnel, in January 1960.<ref>Goldrosen, John (1979). The Buddy Holly Story. Quick Fox. {{ISBN|978-0-825-63936-4}}</ref> All six songs were included in ''[[The Buddy Holly Story, Vol. 2]]'' (1960).

The demand for Holly records was so great (although none saw much chart success on the US billboards), and Holly had recorded so prolifically, that his record label was able to release new Holly albums and singles for the next 10 years. Norman Petty produced most of these new editions, drawing upon unreleased studio masters, alternate takes, audition tapes, and even amateur recordings (some dating back to 1954 with low-fidelity vocals). The final "new" Buddy Holly album, ''[[Giant (Buddy Holly album)|Giant]]'', was released in 1969; the single chosen from the album was "[[Love Is Strange]]."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Buddy Holly- Giant |year=1969 |url=https://www.discogs.com/Buddy-Holly-Giant/master/490135 |access-date=February 24, 2019 |publisher=discogs}}</ref>
 
''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' stated that Holly "produced some of the most distinctive and influential work in rock music."{{sfn|Crenshaw, Marshall|2015}} [[AllMusic]] defined him as "the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll."{{sfn|Eder, Bruce|2015}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him number 13 on its list of "100 Greatest Artists."{{sfn|Mellecamp|2011}} The ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' called him a "pioneer and a revolutionary [...] a multidimensional talent [...] (who) co-wrote and performed (songs that) remain as fresh and potent today."{{sfn|Norman, Phillip|2015}} In 2023, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked Holly at number 74 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=January 1, 2023 |title=The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-singers-all-time-1234642307/buddy-holly-8-1234642434/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 20, 2023}}</ref>

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included Holly among its first class in 1986. On its entry, the Hall of Fame remarked upon the large quantity of material he produced during his short musical career, and said it "made a major and lasting impact on popular music." It called him an "innovator" for writing his own material, his experimentation with [[double tracking]] and the use of [[orchestration]]; he is also said to have "pioneered and popularized the now-standard" use of two guitars, bass, and drums by rock bands.{{sfn|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame staff|2015}} [[The Songwriters Hall of Fame]] also inducted Holly in 1986, and said his contributions "changed the face of Rock 'n' Roll."{{sfn|Songwriters hall of Fame staff|2002}} Holly developed in collaboration with Petty techniques of [[overdubbing]] and [[reverb effect|reverb]], while he used innovative instrumentation later implemented by other artists.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}} Holly became "one of the most influential pioneers of rock and roll" who had a "lasting influence" on genre performers of the 1960s.{{sfn|Henderson|Stacey|p=296|2014}}

[[File:Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, TX IMG 0078.JPG|thumb|The [[Buddy Holly Center]], a museum in Lubbock, Texas]]
In 1980, [[Grant Speed]] sculpted a statue of Holly playing his Fender guitar. This statue is the centerpiece of Lubbock's Walk of Fame, which honors notable people who contributed to Lubbock's musical history. Other memorials to Buddy Holly include a street named in his honor and the [[Buddy Holly Center]], which contains a museum of Holly memorabilia and fine arts gallery. The center is located on Crickets Avenue, one street east of Buddy Holly Avenue, in a building that previously housed the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway Depot.{{sfn|Buddy Holly Center staff|2014}} In 2010, the statue was taken down for refurbishment, and construction of a new Walk of Fame began.

In 1997, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] gave Holly the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]].{{sfn|Hollywood Reporter Staff|1997}} He was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2000. On May 9, 2011, the City of Lubbock held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Buddy and Maria Elena Holly Plaza, the new home of the statue and the Walk of Fame.{{sfn|Kerns|2011}} On what would have been his 75th birthday, a star bearing Holly's name was placed on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].{{sfn|Duke, Alan|2011}}

===Influence===

==== The Beatles ====
[[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] saw Holly for the first time when he appeared on ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]''.{{sfn|Humphries|p=73|2003}} The two had recently met and begun their musical association. They studied Holly's records, learned his performance style and lyricism, and based their act around his persona. Inspired by Holly's insect-themed Crickets, they chose to name their band "[[the Beatles]]". Lennon and McCartney later cited Holly as one of their main influences.{{sfn|Riley|p=67–70|2011}}

Lennon's band [[the Quarrymen]] covered "That'll Be the Day" in their first recording session, in 1958.{{sfn|Gaar|p=238|2013}} During breaks in the Beatles' first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', on February 9, 1964, Lennon asked [[CBS]] coordinator Vince Calandra about Holly's performances; Calandra said Lennon and McCartney repeatedly expressed their appreciation of Holly.{{sfn|Harris|p=192–193|2014}} The Beatles recorded a close cover of Holly's version of "[[Words of Love]]", which was released on their 1964 album ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'' (in the US, in June 1965 on ''[[Beatles VI]]''). During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of "Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues" – which Holly popularized but did not write – with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2014|p=186}} Lennon recorded a cover version of "Peggy Sue" on his 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]''.{{sfn|Blaney, John|p=163|2005}} McCartney owns the [[Music publisher|publishing rights]] to Holly's song catalog.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2003}}

==== Bob Dylan ====
On January 31, 1959, two nights before Holly's death, 17-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] attended Holly's performance in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] for ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' in 1998: "...&nbsp;when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at [[Duluth National Guard Armory]] and I was three feet away from him&nbsp;... and he looked at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he was&nbsp;... with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way."{{sfn|Shelton|p=37|2011}}

==== The Rolling Stones ====
[[Mick Jagger]] saw Holly performing live in [[Woolwich]], London, during a tour of the UK; Jagger particularly remembered Holly's performance of "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" – a song that also inspired [[Keith Richards]], who modeled his early guitar playing on the track. The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964.{{sfn|Norman|p=12|2011}} Richards later said, "[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]&nbsp;...&nbsp;He's in everybody."{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|2014|p=274}}

==== Steve Marriott ====
From a young age, [[Steve Marriott]] was a huge fan of Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. Marriott wrote his first song, called "Shelia My Dear", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him 'Buddy'.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hewitt |first1=Paolo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4fwswEACAAJ |title=Steve Marriott: All Too Beautiful |last2=Hellier |first2=John |date=2004 |publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing |isbn=978-1-900924-44-3 |pages=44 |language=en}}</ref> Marriott also recorded a version of [[Kenny Lynch]]'s song "Give Her My Regards" b/w "Imaginary Love", the B-side written by Marriott, and released as a [[Single (music)|45-rpm]] in 1963 on Decca, inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/master/907139-Steve-Marriott-Give-Her-My-Regards "Steve Marriott - Give Her My Regards"].

==== Don McLean ====
[[Don McLean]]'s popular 1971 [[ballad (music)|ballad]] "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" was inspired by Holly's death and the day of the plane crash. The song's lyric, which calls the incident "The Day the Music Died", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'' is dedicated to Holly.{{sfn|Crouse, Richard|p=86|2012}} In 2015, McLean wrote, "Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments&nbsp;...&nbsp;By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself&nbsp;...&nbsp;in my view and the view of many others, a hit&nbsp;...&nbsp;Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed."{{sfn|McLean|2015}}

==== Eric Clapton ====
''The Chirping Crickets'' was the first album [[Eric Clapton]] ever bought; he later saw Holly on ''Sunday Night at the London Palladium''. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, "I thought I'd died and gone to heaven&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future – that's what I want{{'"}}.{{sfn|Clapton, Eric|p=19|2010}} In 1969, his supergroup [[Blind Faith]] released a cover version of Holly's "Well All Right" featuring [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gallucci |first=Michael |date=January 11, 2023 |title=Top 10 Jeff Beck Songs |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jeff-beck-songs/ |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref>

====Bobby Vee====
The launch of [[Bobby Vee]]'s successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash. Holly's profound influence on Vee's singing style can be heard in the songs "[[Rubber Ball]]" – the B-side of which was a cover of Holly's "Everyday" – and "Run to Him."{{sfn|Dean, Maury|2003|p=73}}

====The Hollies====
The name of the British rock band [[the Hollies]] is often claimed as a tribute to Holly; according to the band, they admired Holly, but their name was mainly inspired by sprigs of holly in evidence around Christmas 1962.{{sfn|Eder, Bruce|1996}}

====Phil Ochs====
In 1970, protest folk singer [[Phil Ochs]] released his sarcastic ''[[Greatest Hits (Phil Ochs album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1970) album, and eventually, his live album ''[[Gunfight at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1974). During his concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] on March 27, 1970, [[Phil Ochs]] performed his "Buddy Holly Medley" comprising Holly's songs "Not Fade Away", "I'm Gonna Love You Too", "Think It Over", "Oh, Boy!", "Everyday", and "It's So Easy".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Buddy Holly Medley (1970/Live At Carnegie Hall) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cxoSpcV0Vo |access-date=May 23, 2024 |website=YouTube| date=October 30, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Sanchez |first=Joshua |date=March 26, 2020 |title=Phil Ochs: the doomed folk singer who woke up from the American dream |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/phil-ochs-the-doomed-folk-singer-who-woke-up-from-the-american-dream |access-date=May 23, 2024 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Before performing the medley, Ochs announced to the audience, "We're going to do a medley of songs of one of the greatest musicians that ever lived, a man who died prematurely, a man who had a big influence on me&nbsp;...&nbsp;Before I became a protest and folk singer, I had memorized many other things before [[Pete Seeger]], before Bob Dylan, before [[the Weavers]], before anything you might have ever heard in New York City, and this is Buddy Holly."

====Elton John====
[[Elton John]] was musically influenced by Holly. At age 13, although he did not require them, John started wearing horn-rimmed glasses to imitate Holly.{{sfn|Goldrosen|1979|p=8}}

====Elvis Costello====
During the height of punk, [[Elvis Costello]] resembled Holly. He wore his stylized glasses and dressed like him.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Crandall |first=Bill |date=February 28, 2003 |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: Elvis Costello |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-elvis-costello-176284/ |access-date=May 23, 2024 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> Bob Dylan on Costello, from his 2022 book ''[[The Philosophy of Modern Song]]'', "Elvis Costello and the Attractions were a better band than any of their contemporaries. Light years better. Elvis himself was a unique figure. Horn-rimmed glasses, quirky, pigeon-toed and intense. The only singer-guitarist in the band. You couldn’t say that he didn’t remind you of Buddy Holly. The Buddy stereotype. At least on the surface. Elvis had Harold Lloyd in his DNA as well. At the point of ‘Pump It Up’, he obviously had been listening to Springsteen too much. But he also had a heavy dose of 'Subterranean Homesick Blues'."<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 7, 2022 |title=Bob Dylan: 'Elvis Costello was light years better' |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/bob-dylan-elvis-costello-was-light-years-better/ |access-date=May 23, 2024 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Dylan |first=Bob |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zXwzgEACAAJ |title=The Philosophy of Modern Song |date=November 1, 2022 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-1-4516-4870-6 |language=en}}</ref>

====Bruce Springsteen====
In an August 24, 1978, interview with ''Rolling Stone'', [[Bruce Springsteen]] told [[Dave Marsh]], "I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest."{{sfn|Deardorff II, Donald|p=16|2013}}

====Grateful Dead====
The [[Grateful Dead]] performed the song "Not Fade Away" in concerts.{{sfn|Meriwether|p=134|2013}}

====Richard Barone====
In 2016, [[Richard Barone]] released his album ''Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s'', paying tribute to the new wave of singer-songwriters in the Village during that pivotal, post-Holly era. The album opens with Barone's version of "Learning the Game", one of the final songs written and recorded by Holly at his home in Greenwich Village, a week before his death.<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 12, 2017 |title=Richard Barone Breathes New Life into the Golden Age of Village Folk |work=Observer |url=http://observer.com/2016/08/richard-barone-breathes-new-life-into-the-golden-age-of-village-folk/}}</ref>

===Film and musical depictions===
====Film====
Holly's life story inspired a Hollywood biographical film, ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'' (1978); its lead actor [[Gary Busey]] received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of Holly. The film was widely criticized by the rock press, and by Holly's friends and family, for its inaccuracies.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Flippo |first=Chet |date=September 21, 1978 |title=The Truth Behind 'The Buddy Holly Story' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-buddy-holly-story-19780921 |url-status=dead |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117070007/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-buddy-holly-story-19780921 |archive-date=November 17, 2017 |access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref> This led Paul McCartney (whose MPL Communications by then controlled the publishing rights to Buddy Holly's song catalog) to produce and host his own documentary about Holly in 1985, titled ''The Real Buddy Holly Story''. This video includes interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, Sonny Curtis, Jerry Allison, Holly's family, and McCartney, among others.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=174–176}}

In 1987, musician [[Marshall Crenshaw]] portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', which depicts him performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the fatal airplane with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. Crenshaw's version of "Crying, Waiting, Hoping" is featured on the ''La Bamba'' original motion picture soundtrack.{{sfn|Green|p=267|1999}}

Holly's follow up to the hit song "Peggy Sue" is featured in the 1986 [[Francis Ford Coppola]] film ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which a 43-year-old mother and housewife facing divorce played by [[Kathleen Turner]] is thrust back in time and given the chance to change the course of her life.

[[Steve Buscemi]] appeared as Holly in a brief cameo as a 1950s-themed restaurant employee in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', in which he takes Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's orders (portrayed respectively by [[Uma Thurman]] and [[John Travolta]]).

In 1998, the post-apocalyptic film ''[[Six-String Samurai]]'' depicted Holly as a guitar-playing samurai traveling to Las Vegas to become the new king of Nevada after the death of Elvis Presley.

==== Television ====
Holly was depicted in a 1989 episode of the science-fiction television program ''[[Quantum Leap (1989 TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' titled "How the Tess Was Won"; Holly's identity is only revealed at the end of the episode. Dr. [[Sam Beckett]] ([[Scott Bakula]]) influences Buddy Holly to change his lyrics from "piggy, suey" to "Peggy Sue", setting up Holly's future hit song.{{sfn|Phillips|Garcia|1996|p=358}}

In the animated series ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', it is implied that the elderly villains Dragoon and Red Mantle are actually Richardson and Buddy Holly, who were recruited into the supervillain organization the Guild of Calamitous Intent on the night of their supposed deaths.

The TV documentaries ''Without Walls: Not Fade Away'' (aired on Channel Four in 1996),{{citation needed|date=May 2024}} and ''Buddy Holly: Rave On'' (aired on BBC Four in 2017).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Buddy Holly: Rave On |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08q8f1n |access-date=May 29, 2022 |website=BBC Four}}</ref> An upcoming documentary ''The Day the Music Died/American Pie'' explores the story behind the Don McLean song.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

'''Carl Lee Perkins''' (April 9, 1932 – January 19, 1998)<ref>{{cite web |title=Carl Perkins – American musician and songwriter |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Perkins |website=britannica.com |access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="nytimesobit">[[#nytimesobit|Pareles.]]</ref> was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter.  A [[rockabilly]] great and pioneer of [[rock and roll]], he began his recording career at the [[Sun Studio]], in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], beginning in 1954. Among his best-known songs are "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]", "[[Honey Don't]]", "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]" and "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]".

According to fellow musician [[Charlie Daniels]], "Carl Perkins' songs personified the rockabilly era, and Carl Perkins' sound personifies the rockabilly sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed."<ref name="naylor118">[[#legends|Naylor, p. 118.]]</ref> Perkins's songs were recorded by artists (and friends) as influential as [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Ricky Nelson]], and [[Eric Clapton]], which further established his prominent place in the history of popular music. [[Paul McCartney]] said "If there were no Carl Perkins, there would be no Beatles."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/rock-n-roll-legend-carl-perkins-much-anticipated-story-to-come-to-the-big-screen-32090.php | title = Rock 'n Roll Legend Carl Perkins' Much Anticipated Story to Come to the Big Screen | date = August 16, 2007 | access-date = April 5, 2013}}</ref>

Nicknamed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Rockabilly]]", Perkins was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]], the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]], and the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. He also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Award.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Carl Lee Perkins was born on April 9, 1932, in [[Tiptonville, Tennessee]], the son of poor [[sharecropper]]s Louise and Buck Perkins (misspelled on his birth certificate as "Perkings").<ref name="autogenerated2">[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/carlperkins/biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226181247/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/carlperkins/biography|date=February 26, 2010}}</ref> Beginning at the age of six, he worked long hours in the cotton fields with his family, whether school was in session or not. Siblings included brothers Jay and Clayton.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 8–9.]]</ref> The boys grew up hearing [[Southern gospel]] music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields.<ref name=pc8>{{Pop Chronicles|8|3}}</ref> On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', broadcast from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on his father's radio.

[[Roy Acuff]]'s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor.]]</ref> Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a [[cigar box guitar|cigar box]] and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out [[Gene Autry]] guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of [[blue note]].<ref name="naylor118" /><ref name=":0">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 13–14.]]</ref>

Perkins taught himself parts of Acuff's "[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|Great Speckled Bird]]" and "[[The Wabash Cannonball]]", having heard them played on the ''Opry''. He also has cited [[Bill Monroe]]'s fast playing and vocals as an early influence.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 11–12.]]</ref> Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to "Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate."<ref name="naylor118" /><ref name=":0" />

In January 1947, the Perkins family moved from [[Lake County, Tennessee]], to [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], 70 miles from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 55.]]</ref> At age fourteen Perkins wrote a country song called "Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg". [[Sam Phillips]] was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his [[Sun Records]] label.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 68.]]</ref>

===Beginnings as a performer===
Perkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern, near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of occasional fights, and both of the Perkins brothers gained a reputation as fighters.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 36–41.]]</ref>

During the next couple of years, as they became better known, the Perkins brothers began playing other taverns around Bemis and Jackson, including El Rancho, the Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop. Carl persuaded his brother Clayton to join them and play the [[upright bass]], to complete the sound of the band.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 48.]]</ref>

Perkins began performing regularly on [[WTJF (AM)|WTJS]] in Jackson during the late 1940s as a sometime member of the [[Tennessee Ramblers (Tennessee band)|Tennessee Ramblers]]. He appeared on the radio program ''Hayloft Frolic'', on which he performed two songs. Sometimes one was "Talking Blues", as done by Robert Lunn on the ''Grand Ole Opry''. Perkins and his brothers began appearing on ''The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour''. Positive listener response resulted in a 15-minute segment sponsored by Mother's Best Flour. By the end of the 1940s, the Perkins Brothers were the best-known band in the Jackson area.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 48–49.]]</ref> Perkins had day jobs during most of these early years, including picking cotton, working at various factories and plants, and as a pan greaser for the Colonial Baking Company.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 32, 70–71.]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |title=The Legend Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillytennessee.com |date=1998-01-19 |access-date=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117221958/http://www.rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |archive-date=November 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His brothers had similar pick-up jobs.

In January 1953, Perkins married Valda Crider, whom he had known for a number of years. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part-time, Valda, who had her own job, encouraged Perkins to begin working the taverns full-time. He began playing six nights a week. Later the same year he added [[W. S. Holland|W.S. "Fluke" Holland]] to the band as a drummer. Holland had no previous experience as a musician but had a good sense of rhythm.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 70–71.]]</ref>

[[Malcolm Yelvington]], who remembered the Perkins Brothers when they played in [[Covington, Tennessee]], in 1953, noted that Carl had an unusual blues-like style all his own.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 77.]]</ref> By 1955 Perkins had made tapes of his material with a borrowed tape recorder, and he sent them to companies such as Columbia and RCA. But he used addresses such as "Columbia Records, New York City" and seemed dismayed at the lack of response. "I had sent tapes to RCA and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and had never heard a thing from 'em."<ref name="Top Beats Bottom"/>

In July 1954, Perkins and his wife heard a new release of "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] on the radio.<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3318.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> As the song faded out, Perkins said, "There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing. I need to go see him."<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 79–90.]]</ref> According to another telling of the story, it was Valda who said that he should go to Memphis.<ref>''Rockabilly Legends''. Naler. p. 121.</ref> Later, Presley told Perkins he had traveled to Jackson and had seen Perkins and his group playing at El Rancho.<ref name="Top Beats Bottom">"The Top Beats the Bottom: Carl Perkins and his Music". ''The Atlantic''. December 1970. p. 100.</ref>

Years later, the musician [[Gene Vincent]] told an interviewer that, rather than Elvis's version of "Blue Moon of Kentucky" being a "new sound", "a lot of people were doing it before that, especially Carl Perkins."<ref>VanHecke, Susan (2000). ''Race with the Devil''. St. Martin's Press. p. 219. {{ISBN|0-312-26222-1}}.</ref>

Perkins successfully auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] in early October 1954. "[[Movie Magg]]" and "Turn Around" were released on the Phillips-owned Flip label (151) on March 19, 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/labels/f/f461.htm |title=Flip (Tenn.)

During the summer of 1955 they had junkets to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and [[Forrest City, Arkansas]], and to [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] and [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]. Again performing at El Rancho, the Perkins brothers were involved in an automobile accident in Woodside, Delaware. A friend who had been driving was pinned by the steering wheel and had to be dragged from the burning car by Perkins. Clayton had been thrown from the car but was not seriously injured.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 122–124.]]</ref>

Another Perkins song, "Gone Gone Gone",<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3234.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/ss/03/ss3287.mp3 |format=MP3 |title=MP3 recording |publisher=Rcs-discography.com |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> released by Sun in October 1955,<ref name="rcs-discography1">{{cite web |url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/p/perk1000.htm |title=Perkins, Carl (RCS Artist Discography) |access-date=2014-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717234900/http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/p/perk1000.htm |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> was also a regional success. It was a "bounce blues in flavorsome combined country and R&B idioms".<ref>''Billboard'', October 22, 1955. "Reviews of New C&W Records." p. 44.</ref> The A-side was the more traditional country song "[[Let the Jukebox Keep On Playing]]".<ref>[http://www.boija.com/skivor/sun_carl.htm The Carl Perkins Sun collection.]</ref>

Commenting on Perkins's playing, Sam Phillips has been quoted as saying

<blockquote>I knew that Carl could rock and in fact he told me right from the start that he had been playing that music before Elvis came out on record&nbsp;... I wanted to see whether this was someone who could revolutionize the country end of the business.<ref>[[Colin Escott|Escott, Colin]]; Hawkins, Martin. ''Good Rockin' Tonight: Sun Records and the Birth of Rock 'n' Roll''. Google eBook. Retrieved 10.11.2011.</ref></blockquote>

Also in the autumn of 1955, Perkins wrote "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]",<ref name=pc8/> inspired by seeing a dancer get angry with his date for scuffing up his shoes.<ref>Perkins, Carl; McGee, David (1996). ''Go, Cat, Go!'' Hyperion Press. p. 129. {{ISBN|0-7868-6073-1}}.</ref> Several weeks later, on December 19, 1955, Perkins and his band recorded the song during a session at Sun Studio in Memphis. Phillips suggested changes to the lyrics ("Go, cat, go"), and the band changed the end of the song to a "[[boogie-woogie|boogie]] [[vamp (music)|vamp]]".<ref name=miller>Miller, James (1999). ''Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947–1977''. Simon & Schuster. pp. 124–25. {{ISBN|0-684-80873-0}}.</ref>

After Sun records headliner Presley left for [[RCA Records|RCA]] in November 1955, Phillips told Perkins, "You're my rockabilly cat now."<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 135.]]</ref> "Blue Suede Shoes" was released on January 1, 1956, and became a massive chart success. In the United States, it reached number 1 on [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'' magazine's]] [[country music]] chart (the only number 1 success he would have) and number 2 on the ''Billboard'' Best Sellers popular music chart. On February 11 Presley performed it on CBS-TV's ''[[Stage Show]]''.  On March 17 Perkins became the first country artist to reach number 3 on the [[rhythm and blues]] charts.<ref name=miller/><ref name="naylor137">[[#legends|Naylor, p. 137.]]</ref> That night, he performed the song on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', and Presley reprised his performance on ''Stage Show''.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Perkins's song reached number 10 on the British charts. It was the first record by a Sun artist to sell a million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd

===Road crash===
After playing a show in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed to [[New York City]] for a March 24 appearance on [[NBC|NBC-TV's]] ''[[The Perry Como Show|Perry Como Show]]''. Shortly before sunrise on March 22, on Route 13 between [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] and [[Woodside, Delaware]], their vehicle hit the back of a pickup truck and went into a ditch containing about 12 inches of water. Holland had to pull Perkins, unconscious, from the water. Perkins had sustained three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body. Perkins remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup truck, Thomas Phillips, a 40-year-old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 178, 180.]]</ref> Jay Perkins had a fractured neck and severe internal injuries. Later he developed a malignant brain tumor, and died in 1958.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morrison|first=Craig|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAHvUO5GknMC&q=%22jay+perkins%22+1958&pg=PA83|title=Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers|date=1999|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06538-5|pages=83|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&q=%22jay+perkins%22+1958|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|date=2011-05-27|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|pages=1988|language=en}}</ref>

On March 23, Presley's band members [[Bill Black]], [[Scotty Moore]] and [[D.J. Fontana]] visited Perkins on their way to New York to appear with Presley. Fontana recalled Perkins saying, "You looked like a bunch of angels coming to see me."<ref>Burke, Ken; Griffin, Dan (2006). ''The Blue Moon Boys: The Story of Elvis Presley's Band''. Chicago Review Press. p. 88. {{ISBN|1-55652-614-8}}.</ref> Black told him, "Hey man, Elvis sends his love", and lit a cigarette for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an [[oxygen tent]].<ref name=":1" /> Presley also telegraphed Perkins his well wishes.<ref name=":1">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 182, 184.]]</ref>

"Blue Suede Shoes" had sold more than 500,000 copies by March 22, and Sam Philips had planned to celebrate by presenting Perkins with a [[Gold Record|gold record]] on ''The Perry Como Show''.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 173.]]</ref> While Perkins recuperated from his injuries, "Blue Suede Shoes" reached number 1 on regional pop, R&B, and country charts. It also reached number 2 on the Billboard pop and country charts, below Elvis Presley's "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]". By mid-April, more than one million copies of "Blue Suede Shoes" had been sold.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 187.]]</ref> On April 3, while still recuperating in Jackson, Perkins watched Presley perform "Blue Suede Shoes" in his first appearance on ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''. This was the third time he performed the song on national television.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 184.]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kki.pl/elvisal/elvis_tv.htm |title=Elvis's Television Appearances 1956–1973 |publisher=Kki.pl |access-date=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718225753/http://www.kki.pl/elvisal/elvis_tv.htm |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Perkins returned to live performances on April 21, 1956, beginning with an appearance in [[Beaumont, Texas]], with the "Big D Jamboree" tour.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 191.]]</ref> Before he resumed touring, Sam Phillips arranged a recording session at Sun, with Ed Cisco filling in for the still-recuperating Jay. By mid-April, "[[Dixie Fried]]", "Put Your Cat Clothes On", "Wrong Yo-Yo", "You Can't Make Love to Somebody", "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]", and "That Don't Move Me" had been recorded.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 198.]]</ref> On May 26, Perkins and his band (with Jay Perkins performing wearing a visible neck brace), finally appeared on ''The Perry Como Show'' to perform "Blue Suede Shoes".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNyvO4QouY Youtube: "Carl Perkins - Blue Suede Shoes - Perry Como Show -1956"]</ref>

[[File:Jamboree Carl Perkins.jpg|thumb|250 px|Perkins (front) performing "[[Glad All Over (Carl Perkins song)|Glad All Over]]" with (left to right) Clayton Perkins, W.S. "Fluke" Holland, and Jay Perkins in the 1957 movie ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]'']]

Beginning early that summer, Perkins was paid $1,000 to play two songs a night on the extended tour of "Top Stars of '56". Other performers on the tour were [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers]]. When Perkins and the group entered the stage in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], he was shocked to see a teenager with a bleeding chin pressed against the stage by the massed crowd. During the first guitar intermission of "Honey Don't", they were waved offstage and into a vacant dressing room behind a double line of police officers. Appalled by what he had seen and felt, Perkins left the tour.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 188, 210, 212.]]</ref> Appearing with [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Lillian Briggs]] in a "rock 'n' roll show", he helped attract 39,872 people to the Reading Fair in Pennsylvania on a Tuesday night in late September. Soon after, a full grandstand and one thousand people stood in a heavy rain to hear Perkins and Briggs at the Brockton Fair in Massachusetts.<ref>''Billboard'', September 29, 1956. pages 73, 78.</ref>

Sun issued more Perkins songs in 1956: "[[Boppin' the Blues]]"/"All Mama's Children" (Sun 243), the B side co-written with Johnny Cash; and "[[Dixie Fried]]"/"I'm Sorry, I'm Not Sorry" (Sun 249). "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]"/"[[Your True Love]]" (Sun 261)<ref>[http://rcs.law.emory.edu/rcs/pics/d03/3238.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205180927/http://rcs.law.emory.edu/rcs/pics/d03/3238.htm|date=February 5, 2009}}</ref> came out in February 1957.<ref name="rcs-discography1"/> "[[Boppin' the Blues]]" reached number 47 on the ''Cashbox'' pop singles chart, number 9 on the ''Billboard'' country and western chart, and number 70 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100 chart.

"Matchbox" is considered a rockabilly classic. It was recorded with Perkins on lead guitar and vocals, and then Sun studio piano player [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].  Later that day there was an impromptu session with Perkins, Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, informally referred to as the [[Million Dollar Quartet]].<ref name=pc8/> The full recordings from this jam session, a selection of gospel, country, and R&B songs, were released in 1990.<ref name="nytimesobit"/>

On February 2, 1957, Perkins again appeared on ''Ozark Jubilee'', singing "Matchbox" and "Blue Suede Shoes". He also made at least two appearances on ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' in [[Compton, California]], in 1957,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/programs/story/index.php?prog=170 |title=Town Hall Party |publisher=hillbilly-music.com |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> singing both songs. Those performances were included in the ''Western Ranch Dance Party'' series filmed and distributed by Screen Gems.

He released "[[That's Right (Carl Perkins song)|That's Right]]", co-written with Johnny Cash, backed with the ballad "Forever Yours", as Sun single 274 in August 1957. Neither side made it onto the charts.

The 1957 film ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]'' included a Perkins performance of "[[Glad All Over (Carl Perkins song)|Glad All Over]]". The song, written by [[Aaron Schroeder]], [[Sid Tepper]], and [[Roy C. Bennett]],<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3240.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> was released by Sun in January 1958.<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/p/perk1000.htm#l2w] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120717234900/http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/p/perk1000.htm|date=July 17, 2012}}</ref>

===Life after Sun===
In 1958, Perkins moved to [[Columbia Records]], for which he recorded "Jive After Five", "Rockin' Record Hop", "Levi Jacket (And a Long Tail Shirt)", "Pop, Let Me Have the Car", "Pink Pedal Pushers", "Any Way the Wind Blows", "Hambone", "Pointed Toe Shoes", "Sister Twister", "L-O-V-E-V-I-L-L-E" and other songs.<ref name="rcs-discography1"/>

In 1959, he wrote the [[country & western]] song "[[The Ballad of Boot Hill]]" for Johnny Cash, who recorded it on an [[extended play|EP]] for Columbia Records. In the same year, Perkins was cast in a Filipino movie produced by People's Pictures, ''Hawaiian Boy'', in which he sang "Blue Suede Shoes".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

He performed often at the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget Casino]] in Las Vegas in 1962 and 1963.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} During this time he toured nine Midwestern states and made a tour in Germany.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 1962 [[Patsy Cline]] recorded "[[So Wrong]]" written by Carl, [[Mel Tillis]] and [[Danny Dill]] and had a #14 hit on the Country charts.

In May 1964, Perkins toured [[UK|Britain]] with [[Chuck Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.de/tour1964.htm#Chuck%20Berry |title=Tour Information 1964 |publisher=Chuckberry.de |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> Perkins had been reluctant to undertake the tour, convinced that as forgotten as he had become in America, he would be even more obscure in the U.K., and did not want to be humiliated by drawing meager audiences. Berry assured him that they had remained much more popular in Britain since the 1950s than they had in the United States, and that there would be large crowds of fans at every show. The popular young rock group [[The Animals]] backed the two performers. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party where he sat on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]. Ringo Starr asked if he could record "Honey Don't". Perkins answered, "Man, go ahead, have at it."<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 142.]]</ref> The Beatles later recorded covers of "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]", "[[Honey Don't]]" and "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]" (recorded by Perkins, adapted from a song originally recorded by [[Rex Griffin]] in 1936, with new music by Perkins; a song with the same title was recorded by Roy Newman in 1938). Ringo sang the lead on the first two, [[George Harrison]] received a rare lead on the third. The Beatles also recorded two versions of "Glad All Over" in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Beatles "Glad All Over" |url=http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/the_beatles/glad_all_over.html |title=The Beatles Lyrics - Glad All Over |publisher=Oldielyrics.com |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> Another tour to Germany followed in the autumn.

He released "Big Bad Blues" backed with "Lonely Heart" as a single on Brunswick Records with [[the Nashville Teens]] in June 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/05909 |title=Carl Perkins - Big Bad Blues / Lonely Heart - Brunswick - UK - 05909 |publisher=45cat |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

In 1966, Perkins signed with Dollie Records and released as his first single "Country Boy's Dream", which reached #22 in the country charts. That same year [[Bob Luman]] had a Top 40 Country hit with Carl's song "Poor Boy Blues".

While on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins went on a four-day drinking binge that ended in him hallucinating floridly and passing out. When he regained consciousness, he went out to the beach with his last bottle of alcohol. In his autobiography, he described falling to his knees and declaring, "Lord,&nbsp;... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you," before hurling the bottle into the sea and vowing to remain sober. Perkins and Cash, who had his own substance-abuse issues, supported each other in their bid to remain sober.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 309–310.]]</ref>

In 1968, Cash recorded the Perkins-written "[[Daddy Sang Bass]]" (which incorporates parts of the American standard "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (Bye and Bye)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]"), and scored No. 1 on the country music charts for six weeks. "Daddy Sang Bass" was a [[Country Music Association]] nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins also played lead guitar on Cash's single "[[A Boy Named Sue]]", recorded live at [[San Quentin]] prison, which went to No. 1 for five weeks on the country chart and No. 2 on the pop chart (the performance was also filmed by [[Granada Television]] for broadcast).

Perkins spent a decade in Cash's touring revue, often as an opening act for Cash (as at the Folsom and San Quentin prison concerts, at which he was recorded singing "Blue Suede Shoes" and "Matchbox" before Cash took the stage; these performances were not released until the 2000s). He also appeared on the television series ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''. On the television program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' on April 16, 1969, hosted by Cash, Perkins performed his song "[[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|Restless]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |title=Restless - Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillyeurope.com |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929222820/http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/kraft-music-hall/johnny-cash...on-the-road/episode/170681/summary.html |title=Kraft Music Hall: Johnny Cash&nbsp;...

Perkins and [[Bob Dylan]] wrote "Champaign, Illinois" in 1969. Dylan had recorded his album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'', a bold crossover into country, in Nashville from February 12 to February 21. He met Perkins when he appeared on ''The Johnny Cash Show'' on June 7.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/the-johnny-cash-show/show/8950/episode.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabssh&tag=tabs;episodes |title=The Johnny Cash Show Season 2 Episode Guide |publisher=TV.com |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601094808/http://www.tv.com/the-johnny-cash-show/show/8950/episode.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabssh&tag=tabs;episodes |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dylan had [[writer's block]] and was unable to complete the song until Perkins contributed a rhythm and some lyrics, upon which Dylan said to him, "Your song. Take it. Finish it."<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins.]]</ref> Perkins registered the song as co-authored and recorded it on his 1969 album ''On Top''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.rockabillyhall.com/CarlPerkins.html | title=RAB Hall of Fame: Carl Perkins | access-date= 2007-01-18 | publisher= Rockabilly Hall of Fame}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://music.aol.com/album/on-top/12282 | archive-url= https://archive.today/20120717200303/http://music.aol.com/album/on-top/12282 | url-status= dead | archive-date= 2012-07-17 | title= On Top: Carl Perkins | access-date= 2007-01-18 | publisher= AOL Music }}</ref>

Also in 1969, Columbia's Murray Krugman placed Perkins with the [[New Rhythm and Blues Quartet]], a rockabilly group based in New York's Hudson Valley. Perkins and NRBQ recorded ''Boppin' the Blues'', which featured the group backing him on songs including his staples "Turn Around" and "Boppin' the Blues", as well as songs recorded separately by Perkins and NRBQ.<ref>''Boppin' the Blues''. Columbia CS9981 (1969).</ref> Perkins appeared with Cash on TV on the popular country series ''[[Hee Haw]]'', on February 16, 1974.

[[Tommy Cash]] (brother of Johnny Cash) had a Top Ten country gospel hit in 1970, with a recording of the song "Rise and Shine", written by Perkins. It reached number 9 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 8 on the Canadian country chart. [[Arlene Harden]] had a Top 40 country hit in 1971 with the Perkins composition "True Love Is Greater Than Friendship", from the film ''[[Little Fauss and Big Halsy]]'' (1971). [[Al Martino]]'s cover of the song that same year reached number 22 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 33 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart.

After a long legal struggle with Sam Phillips over [[royalties]], Perkins gained ownership of his songs in the 1970s and, in 2003, his widow and then owner of the catalog entered into an administration contract with Paul McCartney's [[MPL Communications]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |author=Mike Kovacich |url=http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |title=MACCA-News: McCartney to Administer Perkins's Music |publisher=Macca-central.com |date=April 17, 2003 |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213055837/http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Later years===
The rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1981 Perkins recorded the song "Get It" with [[Paul McCartney]], providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle; according to one source, he fully co-wrote the song with McCartney.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 145.]]</ref> This recording was included on the chart-topping album ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'', released in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pctc259.html |title=Tug Of War |publisher=Jpgr.co.uk |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref>  During 1985, Perkins re-recorded "Blue Suede Shoes" with [[Lee Rocker]] and [[Slim Jim Phantom]] of the [[Stray Cats]], as part of the soundtrack for the film ''[[Porky's Revenge]]''.

In October 1985, Perkins was joined on stage in [[London]] for a television special, ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]'', by [[George Harrison]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Edmunds]], Lee Rocker, [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The show was taped live at the [[Limehouse Studios]]. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on January 1, 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs, with two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing "Blue Suede Shoes", his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a highlight of his later career. It has been praised by fans for the spirited performances delivered by Perkins and his guests. The concert was released for DVD by Snapper Music in 2006.<ref>DVD ''Carl Perkins & Friends''. Released by Graham Nolder/Snapper Music. 2006. Cat:SDVD514</ref>

Perkins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1985. Wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. "Blue Suede Shoes" was chosen as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|“500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll”]]. The song also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]]. Perkins was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his pioneering contribution to the genre.

Perkins's only notable film performance as an actor was in [[John Landis]]'s 1985 film ''[[Into the Night (1985 film)|Into the Night]]''. The cameo-laden film includes a scene in which characters played by Perkins and [[David Bowie]] die by each other's hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089346/fullcredits#cast|title=Into the Night (1985): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

Perkins returned to the Sun Studio in Memphis in 1986, joining Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and [[Roy Orbison]] on the album ''[[Class of '55]]''. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet [[jam session]] involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis in 1956.

In 1989, Perkins co-wrote and played guitar on [[the Judds]]' number 1 country hit, "Let Me Tell You About Love". Also in that year, he signed a record deal with Platinum Records for the album ''Friends, Family, and Legends'', featuring performances by [[Chet Atkins]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Steve Wariner]], [[Joan Jett]] and [[Charlie Daniels]], along with [[Paul Shaffer]] and Will Lee. The song "Wild Texas Wind" became the title track to a made-for-TV [[Wild Texas Wind|movie]] featuring [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Gary Busey]]. In 1996 [[Willie Nelson]], who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duett version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. 
Dolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with the Perkins co-written [[Silver and Gold (Dolly Parton song)|"Silver and Gold"]].

[[Mark O'Connor]] recorded a version of the Perkins classic [[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|"Restless"]] in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US (#19 in Canada).

He again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player, for the album ''706 ReUNION'', released by Belle Meade Records, which also featured [[D. J. Fontana]], Marcus Van Storey and [[the Jordanaires]]. In 1993, Perkins performed with the [[Kentucky Headhunters]] in a music video remake of his song "Dixie Fried", filmed in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]]. In 1994, he teamed up with [[Duane Eddy]] and [[the Mavericks]] to contribute "Matchbox" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

His last album, ''[[Go Cat Go!]]'', released by the independent label Dinosaur Records in 1996, features Perkins singing duets with [[Bono]], Johnny Cash, [[John Fogerty]], George Harrison, Paul McCartney, [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/go_cat_go.html |title=Carl Perkins/Various Artists: Go Cat Go! |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Carl Perkins|chart=all}} ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

His last major concert performance was the [[Music for Montserrat]] all-star charity concert at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on September 15, 1997, four months before his death.

==Personal life==
A strong advocate for the prevention of child abuse, Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center for the prevention of child abuse in Tennessee and the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert planned by Perkins were combined with a grant from the [[National Exchange Club]] to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center's annual operating budget.<ref>Tennessee Historical Commission</ref>

Perkins had one daughter, Debbie, and three sons, Stan, Greg, and Steve.  Stan, Perkins' firstborn son, is also a recording artist. In 2010, he joined forces with [[Jerry Naylor]] to record a duet tribute, "To Carl: Let It Vibrate". Stan has been inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].  Greg played bass on stage alongside his father at the 1985 ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]'' concert in London and co-wrote "Birth of Rock and Roll" with his father.<ref name="GregPerkinsObituary">{{cite web |title=Greg Jaye Perkins: Greg Perkins Obituary |url=https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/jacksonsun/name/greg-perkins-obituary?id=48587406 |website=Legacy.com |publisher=The Jackson Sun |access-date=June 17, 2024 |date=November 20, 2005}}</ref>  (In 1983, a jury in Jackson, Tennessee found Greg Perkins "innocent on two felony counts of vehicular homicide, and guilty on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol."<ref name="GregPerkinsDUI">{{cite web |last1=Hopkins |first1=Gwen |title=Perkins cleared of death charge |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-jackson-sun-gregory-perkins-cleared/14086294/ |website=Newspapers.com |publisher=The Jackson Sun |access-date=June 17, 2024 |location=Jackson, Tennessee |pages=1 |date=December 23, 1983}}</ref>  In 1997, Perkins' wife Valda was "recovering from a yearlong illness,"<ref name="GregPerkinsIllness">{{cite web |last1=Galipault |first1=Gerry |title=Carl Perkins faces another challenge |url=https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1997/04/04/carl-perkins-faces-another-challenge/ |website=Tampa Bay Times |access-date=June 17, 2024 |orig-date=April 4, 1997 |date=October 1, 2005}}</ref> and his son Greg collapsed as a result of liver damage that may have resulted in a liver transplant.<ref name="GregPerkinsIllness"></ref>

<!-- Singer-guitarist [[Luther Perkins]], who was also a member of Cash's touring show, was not related to Perkins. -->

==Guitar style==
As a guitarist Perkins used finger picking, imitations of the pedal steel guitar, [[palm mute|palm muting]], [[arpeggios]], advantageous use of open strings, single and double [[string bending]], [[chromaticism]], country and blues licks, and [[tritone]] and other tonality clashing licks (short phrases that include notes from other keys and move in logical, often symmetric patterns).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paul-clark.com/pages/tutorial/Pentatonics.pdf |title=Pentatonics |publisher=Paul-clark.com |access-date=2015-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116091707/http://www.paul-clark.com/pages/tutorial/Pentatonics.pdf |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A rich vocabulary of chords including sixth and thirteenth chords, ninth and add nine chords, and suspensions, show up in rhythm parts and solos. Free use of syncopations, chord anticipations (arriving at a chord change before the other players, often by an eighth-note) and [[crosspicking]] (repeating a three eighth-note pattern so that an accent falls variously on the upbeat or downbeat) were also in his bag of tricks.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 78.]]</ref>

Francis was born to an [[Italian-American]] family in the [[Ironbound]] neighborhood of [[Newark, New Jersey]], the first child of George Franconero and Ida (née Ferrari-di Vito), spending her first years in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]] area (Utica Avenue/St. Marks Avenue) before the family moved to New Jersey.<ref name=Autobiography>Connie Francis: ''Who's Sorry Now?'' (Autobiography), St. Martin's Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-312-87088-4}}</ref>

Growing up in an Italian-Jewish neighborhood, Francis became fluent in [[Yiddish]], which led her later to record songs in Yiddish and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name="Autobiography"/><ref>Liner notes of the original 1960 album [[Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites]]</ref>

In her autobiography ''Who's Sorry Now?'' published in 1984, Francis recalls that she was encouraged by her father to appear regularly at talent contests, pageants, and other neighborhood festivities from the age of four as a singer and accordion player.

Francis attended [[Newark Arts High School]] in 1951 and 1952. She and her family moved to [[Belleville, New Jersey]], where Francis graduated as [[salutatorian]] from [[Belleville High School (New Jersey)|Belleville High School]] Class of 1955.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB361ABFA1CC71F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "OLD SCHOOL TIES"] ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', January 10, 1985.

Francis continued to perform at neighborhood festivities and talent shows (some of them broadcast on television), appearing alternately as Concetta Franconero and Connie Franconero. Under the latter name, she appeared on [[NBC]]'s variety show ''Startime Kids'' between 1953 and 1955.<ref name=Autobiography/>

During rehearsals for her appearance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' in December 1950, Francis was advised by Godfrey to change her stage name to Connie Francis for easier pronunciation. Godfrey also told her to drop the accordion—advice she gladly followed, as she had begun to hate the large and heavy instrument.<ref name=Autobiography/> Around the same time, Francis took a job as a singer on [[Demo (music)|demonstration records]], to bring unreleased songs to the attention of established singers and/or their management who might choose to record them for a professional commercial record.<ref name=Sox>William Ruhlmann: ''Connie Francis 1955–1959'', companion book to 5 CD Boxed Set ''White Sox, Pink Lipstick... and Stupid Cupid'', Bear Family Records BCD 16 616 EI, Hambergen (Germany) 1993</ref>

===1955–1957: recording contract but commercial failure===
In 1955, ''Startime Kids'' went off the air. In May that same year,<ref name=Roberts>Ron Roberts: ''Connie Francis Discography 1955–1973'' {{Clarify||date=August 2020|reason=Is this supposed to be 1955–1975, as shown here: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8072555/mediaviewer/rm165948928 }}</ref> George Franconero Sr. and Francis's manager George Scheck raised money for a recording session of four songs which they hoped to sell to a major record company under Francis's own name. Even when [[MGM Records]] decided to sign a contract with her, it was because one track she had recorded, "Freddy", happened to be the name of the son of a company executive, Harry A. Meyerson, who thought of the song as a nice birthday gift. Hence, "Freddy" was released as Francis's first single, which turned out to be a commercial failure, just like her next eight solo singles.<ref name=Autobiography/>

Despite these failures, Francis was hired to record the vocals for [[Tuesday Weld]]'s "singing" scenes in the 1956 movie ''[[Rock, Rock, Rock (film)|Rock, Rock, Rock]]'', and for Freda Holloway in the 1957 [[Warner Brothers]] rock and roll movie ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''.<ref name="BB12167"/>

In the fall of 1957, Francis enjoyed her first modest success with a duet single she had recorded with [[Marvin Rainwater]]: "The Majesty of Love", with "You, My Darlin' You" as the B-side, peaked at number 93 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>Warner, Jay (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dcvM0rFOR_cC&pg=PA79 Notable Moments of Women in Music]''. [[Hal Leonard Corporation]]. p. 79. Retrieved July 12, 2020.</ref> Eventually, the single sold over one million copies.<ref name=Sox/>

===1957–1959: last chance and breakthrough===
[[File:Connie Francis - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' notice, December 15, 1958]] 
However, her minor chart success came too late for her record label—Francis's recording contract consisted of ten solo singles and one duet single. Though success had finally seemed to come with "The Majesty of Love", Francis was informed by MGM Records that her contract would not be renewed after her last solo single.

Francis considered a career in medicine and was about to accept a four-year scholarship offered at [[New York University]]. At what was to have been her final recording session for MGM on October 2, 1957, with [[Joe Lipman]] and his orchestra,<ref name=Roberts/> she recorded a [[cover version]] of the 1923 song "[[Who's Sorry Now? (song)|Who's Sorry Now?]]" written by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]]. Francis has said that she recorded it at the insistence of her father, who was convinced it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it had a contemporary [[arrangement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O-kuAAAAIBAJ&pg=3189,1141022&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=The Story Behind Those Golden Records|author=Dachs, David|date=10 May 1959|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|access-date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

Francis did not like the song and argued about it with her father heatedly, delaying the recording of the two other songs during the session so much that she thought no time was left on the continuously running recording tape.<ref name="Freeman"/> Her father insisted, though, and when the recording "Who's Sorry Now?" was finished, only a few seconds remained on the tape.<ref name=Autobiography/>

The single seemed to go unnoticed like all previous releases, just as Francis had predicted, but on January 1, 1958, it debuted on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Francis watched the show and wrote in her diary:

''I heard Dick Clark mention something about a new girl singer. So, what else is new? Another girl singer. There are ninety-five million females in the country, and I'll bet ninety-five percent of them sing. "There's no doubt about it", predicted Mr. Clark. "She's is headed straight for the number one spot". I began feeling sorry for myself and a bit envious, too. Good luck to her, I thought. And then Mr. Clark just happened to play a song called "Who's sorry now" - MY "Who's Sorry Now"!  Well, the feeling was cosmic - just cosmic! Right there in my living-room, it became Mardi Gras-time and New Year's Eve at the turn of the century!''
[[File:Connie Francis - Cash Box 1959.png|thumb|left|Francis on the January 31, 1959 cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine]]
And on February 15 of that same year, Francis performed it on the first episode of ''[[The Dick Clark Show|The Saturday Night Beechnut Show]]'', also hosted by Clark. By mid-year, over a million copies had been sold, and Francis was suddenly launched into worldwide stardom. In April 1958, "Who's Sorry Now?" reached number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 4 in the US.<ref name="MusicVF"/> For the next four years, Francis was voted the "Best Female Vocalist" by ''American Bandstand'' viewers.<ref name=Autobiography/>

As Connie Francis explains at each of her concerts, she began searching for a new hit immediately after the success of "Who's Sorry Now?" since MGM Records had renewed her contract. After the relative failure of the follow-up singles "I'm Sorry I Made You Cry," which stalled at No.&nbsp;36) and [[Heartaches (song)|"Heartaches"]], failing to chart at all, Francis met [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Howard Greenfield]], who sang a number of ballads they had written for her. After a few hours, Francis began writing in her diary while the songwriters played the last of their ballads. This, and her refusal to let Sedaka and Greenfield see the diary to mine it for material, inspired the duo to write Sedaka's own breakthrough hit "[[The Diary (song)|The Diary]].") Afterwards, Francis told them that she considered their ballads too intellectual and sophisticated for the young generation and requested a more lively song. Greenfield urged Sedaka to sing a song they had written that morning with [[the Shepherd Sisters]] in mind. Sedaka protested that Francis would be insulted, but Greenfield said that since she hated all the other songs they had performed, they had nothing to lose. Sedaka then played "[[Stupid Cupid]]." When he finished, Francis announced that he had just played her new hit song. It went on to reach number 14 on the ''Billboard'' chart and was her second number 1 in the UK.<ref name="MusicVF"/>

The success of "Stupid Cupid" restored momentum to Francis' chart career, and she reached the U.S. top 40 an additional eight times during the remainder of the 1950s.<ref name="MusicVF"/> She managed to churn out more hits by covering several older songs, such as [[My Happiness (popular song)|"My Happiness"]] (number 2 on the Hot 100) and "[[Among My Souvenirs]]" (number 7), as well as performing her own original songs. In 1959, she gained two gold records for a double-sided hit: on the A-side, "[[Lipstick on Your Collar (song)|Lipstick on Your Collar]]" (number 5), and on the B-side, "[[Frankie (Connie Francis song)|Frankie]]" (number 9).

===1959–1973: international recording star===
Following another idea from her father, Francis traveled to [[London]] in August 1959<ref name=Roberts/> to record an Italian album at [[EMI]]'s famous [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=Sox/> Titled ''[[Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites]]'', the album was released in November 1959. It soon entered the album charts where it remained for 81 weeks, peaking at number 4 and becoming Francis's most successful album. [[Mama (David Whitfield song)|"Mama,"]] the single taken from the album, reached number 8 in the United States and number 2 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=Souvenirs>''Souvenirs'', Companion Booklet to 4 CD Boxed Set "Souvenirs", Polydor (New York) 1995, Cat.-No. 314 533 382-2</ref>

Following this success, Francis recorded seven more albums of "favorites" between 1960 and 1964, including [[Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites|Jewish]], [[Connie Francis Sings German Favorites|German]], and [[Connie Francis Sings Irish Favorites|Irish]], among others. These albums marked Francis's transition from the youth-oriented [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll music]] to [[adult contemporary music]], which George Franconero, Sr. had realized would be necessary if his daughter was to have a successful longterm music career.

Nevertheless, Francis continued to record singles aimed at the youth-oriented market. Among her top-ten hits on the Hot 100 were "[[Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart]]" (1961, number 7), [[When the Girl in Your Arms is the Girl in Your Heart|"When the Boy in Your Arms (Is the Boy in Your Heart)"]] (1961, number 10), "[[Connie Francis Sings "Second Hand Love"|Second Hand Love]]" (1962, number 7), and [[Where the Boys Are (Connie Francis song)|"Where the Boys Are"]] (1961, number 4).<ref name="MusicVF"/> The last one became her signature tune and became the theme song of Francis's first [[Where the Boys Are|motion picture]]. The movie introduced the concept of [[spring break]], as the once sleepy town of [[Fort Lauderdale]] became the hotspot for college students on their spring vacation in the wake of the movie's success.

The success of "Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites" in late 1959/early 1960 led Francis to become one of the first American artists to record regularly in other languages. She was followed by other major British and American recording stars including [[Wanda Jackson]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[the Supremes]], [[Peggy March]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Lesley Gore]], [[the Beatles]] and [[Johnny Cash]], among many others. In her autobiography, Francis mentioned that in the early years of her career, the language barrier in some European countries, especially in Germany, made it difficult for her songs to get airplay.

Francis used these reflections as the basis for her April 1960 recording, "[[Everybody's Somebody's Fool]]" which would go on to become the first single by a female artist to top the [[Hot 100]].<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7616906/leading-ladies-women-success-hot-100-chart Leading Ladies: A Look at Women's No. 1 Success in the Hot 100's History]</ref> Veteran lyricist Ralph Maria Siegel penned a set of German lyrics, named "''[[Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel]]''", which, after some friction between Francis and her MGM executives, was recorded and released.<ref name=Autobiography/> The song peaked at number 1 in [[West Germany]].<ref>[https://norwegiancharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Connie+Francis&titel=Die+Liebe+ist+ein+seltsames+Spiel&cat=s Connie Francis - Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel], norwegiancharts.com. Retrieved March 10, 2021.</ref> She had two more number one hits there, "Paradiso" in September 1962 and "Barcarole in der Nacht" in July 1963.

It was not until her number 7 on the US charts, "[[Many Tears Ago]]", later in 1960 when Francis began to record cover versions of her songs in foreign languages other than German. Over the years she expanded her recording portfolio to 15 languages. She also sang in Romanian during a live performance at the 1970 edition of the [[Golden Stag Festival|Cerbul de Aur]] in [[Brașov]], Romania. Francis was not fluent in all of these languages and she had to [[phonetical singing|learn her foreign language songs phonetically]]. Francis explained in a 1961 television interview that she was fluent in Spanish and Italian, but always had a translator nearby to make sure her translated lyrics and especially her pronunciation were as correct as possible.
[[File:Vacation - The Biggest Sin of All - Billboard ad 1962.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ad for Francis's final top-ten hit, "Vacation", July 14, 1962]] 
In the wake of "''Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel''", Francis enjoyed her greatest successes outside the United States. During the 1960s, her songs not only topped the charts in numerous countries around the world, but she was also voted the number 1 singer in over 10 countries. In 1960, she was named the most popular artist in Europe, the first time a non-European received this honor. From mid-1961 to mid-1963, [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] closed each day's broadcasts with "It's Time to Say Goodnight", a song Francis had recorded especially for them and was not officially released until 1996.<ref name=Twistin>Ron Roberts: ''Connie Francis 1960–1962'', companion book to 5 CD Boxed Set "Kissin', Twistin', Goin' Where the Boys Are", Bear Family Records BCD 16 826 EI, Hambergen (Germany) 1996</ref>

Francis's enduring popularity overseas led to television specials in countries around the world such as Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy. Even at the height of the [[Cold War]], Francis's music was well received in [[Iron Curtain]] countries, and some of her recordings were made available on state-owned record labels such as [[Melodiya]] in the former Soviet Union and on [[Jugoton]] in former Yugoslavia,<ref name=Twistin/> although it was common knowledge that rock 'n' roll was highly disparaged in [[Eastern bloc]] countries.

In the US, Connie Francis had a third number-one hit in 1962: "[[Don't Break the Heart That Loves You]]", and her success led MGM to allow her complete freedom to choose whichever songs she wanted to record.<ref name=Sox/>

Francis's first autobiography, ''For Every Young Heart'', was published in 1963. On July 3 that same year, she played a [[Royal Command Performance]] for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. During the height of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, Connie Francis performed for US troops.<ref name="NotSorry"/><ref>Voger, Mark. "[https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2013/11/connie_francis.html Where the boys were: Connie Francis recalls Vietnam trip]", [[NJ.com]]. November 7, 2013. Retrieved July 9, 2020.</ref> Francis recalls this story frequently during the introduction to "[[God Bless America]]" at her live concerts.

Due to music trends in the early and mid-1960s, especially the [[British Invasion]], Francis's chart success on ''Billboard's'' Hot 100 began to wane after 1963. She had her final top-ten hit, "Vacation", in 1962. A number of Francis's singles reached the top 40 in the US Hot 100 in the mid-1960s, with her last top-40 entry in 1964 being her cover version of "[[Be Anything (but Be Mine)]]", a 1952 song made famous by singer/bandleader [[Eddy Howard]]. Despite her declining success on the Hot 100, Francis remained a top concert draw, and her singles – with a more mature style – were charting on the top quarter of'' Billboard's'' [[Billboard Adult Contemporary|Adult Contemporary (AC) Charts]] and sometimes even reached ''Billboard's'' [[Billboard Country Singles|Country Charts]]. Francis enjoyed lasting chart success in the US until her contract with MGM Records expired in 1969.<ref name=Souvenirs/>

In 1965, Connie Francis participated in that year's edition of the annual [[San Remo Festival]], where her team partner [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and she presented "''[[Ho bisogno di vederti]]''", which finished on number 5 of the final ranking.

[[File:Connie Francis.jpg|thumb|Connie Francis c. 1970]]
Francis returned to San Remo in 1967 to present "''Canta Ragazzina''" with her team partner [[Bobby Solo]].<ref>"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64 Key Tradesters Invade As Opening Bell Sounds at Festival]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.

In 1973, Francis returned to the recording studio, cutting "(Should I) Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree?", b/w "Paint the Rain" on GSF Records. This [[answer song]] to [[Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree|"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree"]] by [[Tony Orlando & Dawn]] [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|bubbled]] under the charts. The recording of a German version, though, remained unfinished.<ref name=Roberts/><ref>Richard Weize: ''Connie Francis'', companion book to 8 LP Boxed Set "Connie Francis in Deutschland", Bear Family Records BFX 15 305, Hambergen/Vollersode (Germany) 1988</ref><ref>Jan Feddersen: ''Connie Francis'', companion book to 5 CD Boxed Set "Lass mir die bunten Träume", Bear Family Records BCD 15 786 AH, Hambergen (Germany) 1994</ref>

===1974–1981: tragedy and return===
After her modest success with "(Should I) Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree?" Francis began performing regularly again. While appearing at the [[Westbury Music Fair]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], on November 8, 1974, Francis was [[rape]]d at the [[Jericho Turnpike]] [[Howard Johnson's]] Lodge in [[Jericho, New York]], and nearly suffocated under the weight of a heavy mattress the culprit had thrown upon her.<ref name=Autobiography/> She subsequently [[lawsuit|sued]] the motel chain for failing to provide adequate security and reportedly won a $2.5 million judgment,<ref>Clayton W.

The Spanish and German recordings became albums of their own in as ''Connie Francis en Español'' in Spain and as ''Was ich bin'' (What I Am) in Germany. All three albums and the singles culled from them were released on [[United Artists Records]].

Francis returned again to the studio in 1981 to cut "''Comme ci, comme ça''", and "I'm Me Again", the latter of which became the title track of an album which featured the new songs.<ref>"[https://www.allmusic.com/album/im-me-again-silver-anniversary-album-mw0000961877 I'm Me Again--Silver Anniversary Album - Connie Francis]", [[AllMusic]].

Despite that, she took up live performing again, even gracing the ''American Bandstand'' 30th Anniversary Special and appearing in the town where she had been raped.

Nevertheless, in 1984, Francis was able to write and publish her autobiography, ''Who's Sorry Now?'', which became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]].

===1989–2018: later career===
In 1989, Francis resumed her recording and performing career once again. For [[Malaco Records]], Francis recorded a double album entitled ''Where the Hits Are'', containing re-recordings of 18 of her biggest hits, as well as six classics of [[Nostalgia|yesteryear]] Francis had always wanted to record such as [[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|"Are You Lonesome Tonight?"]] and "[[Torn Between Two Lovers (song)|Torn Between Two Lovers]]".

In 1992, a medley of remixed versions of her biggest German hits charted in Germany.<ref>Sinclair, David.

In the wake of this, Francis recorded two duets for the German Herzklang label (a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Entertainment]]) with [[Peter Kraus]], with whom she had already worked several times in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A German-language solo album was supposed to follow on Herzklang, but despite all songs being recorded and mixed, the album remains unreleased.

In 1996, Francis released the live album ''The Return Concert: Live at Trump's Castle''.<ref>"[https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-return-concert-live-at-trumps-castle-mw0000079754 The Return Concert: Live at Trump's Castle - Connie Francis]", [[AllMusic]].

===Relationship with Bobby Darin===
Early in her career, Francis was introduced to [[Bobby Darin]], then an up-and-coming singer and songwriter. Darin's manager arranged for him to help write several songs for her. Despite some disagreement about material, after several weeks Darin and Francis developed a romantic relationship. Francis' strict Italian father would separate the couple whenever possible. When her father learned that Darin had suggested the two elope after one of her shows, he ran Darin out of the building at gunpoint.<ref>Nolasco, Stephanie. "[https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/connie-francis-reflects-on-her-romance-with-bobby-darin-before-his-untimely-death Connie Francis reflects on her romance with Bobby Darin before his untimely death]", [[Fox News]].

Francis saw Darin only two more times: once when the two were scheduled to sing together for a television show, and again when she was spotlighted on the TV series ''[[This Is Your Life (American franchise)|This Is Your Life]]''. By the time of the latter's taping, Darin had married actress [[Sandra Dee]]. In her autobiography, Francis stated she and her father were driving into the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] when the radio [[DJ]] announced Dee and Darin's marriage. Her father made a negative comment about Darin finally being out of their lives. Angered, Francis wrote she hoped the [[Hudson River]] would fill the Lincoln Tunnel, killing both her and her father; she later wrote that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref name=Autobiography/>

===Biopic===
Francis and singer [[Gloria Estefan]] completed a screenplay for a movie based on Francis' life titled ''Who's Sorry Now?'' Estefan announced that she would produce and play the lead. She said, "[Connie Francis] isn't even in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and yet she was the first female pop star worldwide, and has recorded in nine languages. She has done a lot of things for victims' rights since her rape in the '70s.... There's a major story there." In December 2009 the film project was dropped. According to Francis:
{{blockquote|text=They chose to use amateur writers to write the screenplay. I wanted the writer [[Robert L. Freedman|Robert Freeman]] who wrote that miniseries ''[[Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows]]'', which won I don't know how many [[Emmy Award]]s, but Gloria and company were unwilling to hire that writer. I absolutely adored his screenplay of [[Judy Garland|Judy]]'s life ... he was so eager to do my life story for film, but she [Gloria] wouldn't agree to hire him and that was the end of that. And I'm sorry I wasted ten years with those people [i.e. the Estefans].<ref name=Daeida>''Daeida Magazine'' (December 2009) – Interview by: David Ybarra, p. 26, webpage: [http://www.daeida.com/DAEIDA_2010_Archive_Holiday2009.html daeida-AH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104184749/http://www.daeida.com/DAEIDA_2010_Archive_Holiday2009.html |date=January 4, 2016 }}.</ref>}}

In the same article, Francis said that [[Dolly Parton]] had been contacting her for years trying to produce her life story, but owing to her previous commitment to Estefan's organization, she was not able to accept Parton's offer.  She noted in the article that both she and Parton had considered, independently of each other, actress [[Valerie Bertinelli]] to play Francis.<ref name=Daeida/>

===Politics and activism===
Francis supported [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] bid for the [[President of the United States|presidency]] when she recorded a [[campaign song]] for him.<ref>Tsioulcas, Anastasia. "[https://www.kqed.org/arts/12123103/the-long-strange-history-of-campaign-endorsement-songs The Long, Strange History of Campaign Endorsement Songs]", [[KQED-FM]]. September 27, 2016. Retrieved July 11, 2020.</ref>

In the 1980s, [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed her as head of his task force on violent crime. She has also been the spokeswoman for Mental Health America's trauma campaign, as well as an involved worker for the [[USO]] and [[UNICEF]].

In a 2011 interview, Francis described herself as "a die-hard [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]]".<ref name="village">{{cite web |title=Connie Francis Interview About Her Struggle With Mental Health |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/06/03/connie-francis-interview-about-her-struggle-with-mental-health/ |website=The Village Voice |access-date=18 March 2021 |date=3 June 2011}}</ref>

===Lawsuits===
Francis brought a suit alleging that [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG) took advantage of her condition and stopped paying royalties.  The lawsuit was dismissed.

On November 27, 2002, she filed a second suit against UMG alleging the label had inflicted severe emotional distress on her and violated her [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] when, without her permission, it synchronized several of her songs into "sexually themed" movies: the 1994 film ''[[Post Cards from America]]'', the 1996 film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', and the 1999 film ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]''.<ref name=Lawsuit2002>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lavelysinger.com/MoralRights.pdf |last=Self |first=Henry |title=Moral Rights and Musicians in the United States |work=2003–2004 Entertainment, Publishing and the Arts Handbook 165 |year=2003 |access-date=April 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916073046/http://www.lavelysinger.com/MoralRights.pdf |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This suit was also dismissed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bureau of |first1=National Affairs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXUoAQAAMAAJ |title=BNA's Patent, Trademark & Copyright Journal |year=2003 |page=228 |access-date=2017-10-17 }}</ref>

In 1960, Eddy signed a contract directly with Jamie Records, bypassing Sill and Hazlewood, which caused a temporary rift between Eddy and Hazlewood.<ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> The result was that for the duration of his contract with Jamie, Eddy produced his own singles and albums.

==Signature guitars==
Eddy's favored guitar was a 1957 Chet Atkins [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar that he bought at Ziggie's Music in Phoenix, Arizona in 1957.<ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> He traded in an early 1950s gold top [[Gibson Les Paul Standard]] guitar for it,<ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> plus monthly payments of $17.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celebrityrockstarguitars.com/rock/eddy.htm |title=Duane Eddy |website=Celebrityrockstarguitars.com |access-date=December 7, 2013 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233707/http://www.celebrityrockstarguitars.com/rock/eddy.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 1959's ''[[The "Twangs" the "Thang"]]'' LP he also used a [[Danelectro]] six-string bass.<ref name=Reverb>{{cite web |url=https://reverb.com/uk/news/interview-duane-eddy-bacons-archive |title=Twagin' the Golden Days |date=April 25, 2019 |author=Tony Bacon |website=Reverb.com |access-date=May 1, 2024 |archive-date=May 1, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240501210900/https://reverb.com/uk/news/interview-duane-eddy-bacons-archive |url-status=live }}</ref>

Eddy became the first [[rock and roll]] guitarist to have a signature guitar when, in 1961, the [[Guild Guitar Company]] introduced the Duane Eddy signature models DE-400 and the deluxe DE-500.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/five-reasons-duane-eddy-is-a-guitar-legend |title=Five Reasons Duane Eddy is a Guitar Legend |date=19 October 2021 |journal=Guitar Player |access-date=May 1, 2024 |archive-date=May 1, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240501211438/https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/five-reasons-duane-eddy-is-a-guitar-legend |url-status=live }}</ref> A limited edition of the DE-500 model was reissued briefly in 1983 to mark Eddy's 25th anniversary in the recording industry. In 1997, 40 years after he bought his Gretsch Chet Atkins 6120, [[Gretsch]] started production of the Duane Eddy Signature Model, the Gretsch 6120-DE. In 2004, the [[Gibson (guitar company)|Gibson]] Custom Art and Historic Division introduced the new Duane Eddy Signature Gibson guitar. A new Gretsch G6120DE Duane Eddy Signature model was released in spring 2011 and in 2018 Gretsch released the G6120TB-DE Duane Eddy 6-string bass model.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/duane-eddy-you-use-the-technology-and-dont-let-it-use-you-i-cant-get-that-through-to-people |journal=Music Radar |title=Duane Eddy: "You use the technology and don't let it use you.

'''Ray Edward Cochran''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|r|ən}} {{respell|KOK|rən}}; October 3, 1938 – April 17, 1960), known professionally as '''Eddie Cochran''',  was an American [[rock and roll]] musician. His songs, such as "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]", "[[Summertime Blues]]", "[[C'mon Everybody]]" and "[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.<ref name="RRHOF">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Eddie Cochran: Hall of Fame Essay|work=Inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|location=Cleveland, Ohio|year=1987|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/eddie-cochran/|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Cochran experimented with [[multitrack recording]], distortion techniques, and [[overdubbing]], even on his earliest singles.<ref name=Cochran2003>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Bobby|author-link=Bobby Cochran|last2=Van Hecke|first2=Susan|title=Three Steps to Heaven: The Eddie Cochran Story|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=2003|isbn=978-0634032523}}</ref> Cochran played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.<ref name=RRHOF/> His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death, Cochran achieved iconic status.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2020|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-cochran-mn0000793988/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>

Cochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.<ref name=Cochran2003/> In 1955, Cochran formed a duo with the guitarist [[Hank Cochran]] (no relation) and became known as the Cochran Brothers. When they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with [[Jerry Capehart]]. His first success came when he performed the song "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', starring [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] and his first record for the label, "[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]", rose to number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]].

Cochran died at the age of 21 in St Martin's Hospital, [[Bath, Somerset]], after a car accident in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]], at the end of his British tour with [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.  On April 16, after they had just performed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]], on their way to their next venue, Vincent, Cochran and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi. The other two passengers survived with major injuries, but Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.

Though Cochran's best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists. [[Paul McCartney]] himself chose Cochran's "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" as his audition piece, assured to impress [[John Lennon]] by his performance of it, which he did and was hired as a member of Lennon's [[skiffle]] group [[The Quarrymen]], which later was renamed [[The Beatles]].

==Early life==
Cochran was born on October 3, 1938, in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], to Alice and Frank R. Cochran. He was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name="Cochran2003" /> Cochran's parents were from Oklahoma. Cochran took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Additionally, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.

In 1952, Cochran's family moved to [[Bell Gardens, California]]. As his guitar playing improved, Cochran formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. In January 1955, Cochran dropped out of [[Bell Gardens High School]] in his first year to become a professional musician.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |year=2020 |title=Eddie Cochran Biography |url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/features/eddie-cochran |access-date=April 14, 2020 |work=Featured Pages |publisher=Gretsch Guitars |location=Savannah, Georgia}}</ref>

==Career==
=== The Cochran Brothers (1955–1956) ===
[[File:The Cochran Brothers.jpg|thumb|The Cochran Brothers]]
During a show featuring many performers at an [[American Legion]] hall, Cochran met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter. Although they were not related, they recorded as the Cochran Brothers and began performing together.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Alan|title=Eddie Cochran|work=Rockabilly Legends|publisher=[[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]|location=Nashville, Tennessee|year=2020|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/EddieCochran.html|access-date=April 14, 2020|archive-date=April 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411042315/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/EddieCochran.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> They recorded a few singles for [[Ekko Records]] that were fairly successful and helped to establish them as a performing act.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cochran Brothers |url=https://rcs-discography.com/rcs/search.php?type=acode&key=coch7500 |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=RCS-Discography.com}}</ref> Eddie Cochran also worked as a session musician and began writing songs, making a demo with [[Jerry Capehart]], his future [[music manager|manager]].

=== Solo and film appearances (1956–1959) ===
In July 1956, Eddie Cochran's first "solo artist" single was released by [[Crest Records]].<ref name=bigvjamboree>{{cite web|last=Vidal|first=Paul|title=The Crest Records Story|work=The Labels
|publisher=Paul Vidal Enterprises, Inc.|year=2020|url=http://www.bigvjamboree.com/CREST-RECORDS.html|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> It featured "Skinny Jim", now regarded as a rock-and-roll and rockabilly classic. In the spring of 1956, [[Boris Petroff]] asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956). Cochran agreed and performed the song "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" in the movie. In 1957, Cochran starred in his second film, ''[[Untamed Youth]]'' (1957), and had yet another hit, "[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]", one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case [[John D. Loudermilk]]). "Twenty Flight Rock" was written by AMI staff writer [[Ned Fairchild]] (a pen name—her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran's major changes and contributions to the final product.

==== ''Singin' to My Baby'' (1957) ====
In the summer of 1957, [[Liberty Records]] issued Cochran's only studio album released during his lifetime, ''[[Singin' to My Baby]]''. The album included John D. Loudermilk's "Sittin' in the Balcony". For the album, Cochran worked with manager and songwriter [[Jerry Capehart]], and wrote the songs "Completely Sweet", "Undying Love", "When I'm Mad", and Cochran original "One Kiss".<ref>{{Cite web |date=1957 |title=Eddie Cochran With The Johnny Mann Orchestra And Chorus – Singin' To My Baby |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/290087-Eddie-Cochran-With-The-Johnny-Mann-Orchestra-And-Chorus-Singin-To-My-Baby |access-date=May 25, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>

In 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem "[[Summertime Blues]]" (co-written with Jerry Capehart). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] recording no. 55144, charted at number&nbsp;8 in 1958.

Originally, Cochran toured with [[The Kelly Four]] as his backing band, guitarist [[Mike Deasy]], saxophonist Mike Henderson, bassist [[Dave Shriver]], and drummer [[Gene Riggio]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kelly Four Discography {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2874069-The-Kelly-Four |access-date=May 27, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref> They were known as The Hollywood Swingers, a reference to [[Dick D'Agostin]]'s band. The line-up of Cochran's touring band would change overtime, with saxophonist [[Seals and Crofts|Jim Seals]] and bassist [[Connie 'Guybo' Smith]], and the addition of pianist [[Jim Stivers]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Seals session with Eddie Cochran |url=http://thompsonian.info/sealsec.html |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=thompsonian.info}}</ref> They were eventually joined by various members from Dick D'Agostin and The Swingers. In 1959, The Swingers line-up became [[Multi-instrumentalist|muti-instrumentalist]] with pianist Dick D'Agostin, pianist Jim Stivers (briefly on bass), guitarist [[Larry D'Agostin]], saxophonist [[Paul Kaufman]], and drummer Gene Riggio. However, D'Agostin left and was called-up to enlist into the U.S. Army. Members from The Kelly Four returned, Deasy and Henderson, with Stivers and Riggio being accompanied by bassist Don Meyer (later replaced by Dave Shriver). This was the last line-up of Cochran's touring band, returning to the name of The Kelly Four.<ref name=":3" /> [[File:C'mon, Everybody - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, December 15, 1958]]

Cochran starred in his last film ''[[Go, Johnny, Go!]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051665/ |title=Go, Johnny, Go! (1959) ⭐ 5.8 {{!}} Drama, Music, Romance |language=en-US |access-date=2024-05-24 |via=m.imdb.com}}</ref> In January 1960, Cochran recorded his last session at [[Gold Star Studios]].<ref name=":4" /> His brief music career included a few more hits, such as "[[C'mon, Everybody]]", "[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]", "[[Teenage Heaven]]", and "[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]", which posthumously topped the charts in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1960. He remained popular in the United States and United Kingdom through the late 1950s and early 1960s, and more of his records were posthumous hits, such as "My Way", "[[Weekend (Eddie Cochran song)|Weekend]]", and "Nervous Breakdown".

=== Television appearances ===
Throughout his music career, Cochran made a few television appearances. On October 22, 1957 in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], Cochran appeared on [[KPTV]]'s ''High Time'', hosted by Gene Brendler, and sang "Am I Blue?".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oregon Historical Society |date=March 24, 2018 |title=KPTV's High Time - Studio Outtakes (1958, MI# 09905) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aPORttAbs4&t=0s |access-date=May 24, 2024 |website=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.facebook.com/thewheelgrinders/videos/on-this-day-62-years-ago-october-22nd-1957-eddie-cochran-guested-on-the-kptv-tee/411485446183229/ |title=On this day 62 years ago, October 22nd 1957, Eddie Cochran guested on the KPTV teenager's music show "High Time" in Portland, Oregon.

=== Session musician and producer ===
Another aspect of Cochran's short but brilliant career is his work as a session musician and producer.<ref name="bigvjamboree" /> In 1959, Cochran played lead for [[Skeets McDonald]] at Columbia's studios for "You Oughta See Grandma Rock" and "Heart Breaking Mama". In a session for [[Gene Vincent]] in March 1958, he contributed his trademark bass voice, as heard on "Summertime Blues". The recordings were issued on the album ''A Gene Vincent Record Date''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eddiecochran.info/Sessions/IV.htm|title=Remembering Eddie Cochran|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810005803/http://www.eddiecochran.info/Sessions/IV.htm |access-date=March 4, 2024|archive-date=August 10, 2016 }}</ref>

Cochran worked mainly as a guitarist, and sometimes as a vocalist and arranger for other artists, such as [[Mamie Van Doren]], [[Baker Knight]], [[Johnny Burnette]], [[Wynn Stewart]], and [[Al Casey (rock guitarist)|Al Casey]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Eddie Cochran: In Session |url=https://propermusic.com/products/eddiecochran-insession |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=Proper Music |language=en}}</ref> 

=== The Day the Music Died (1959) ===
{{Main article|The Day the Music Died}}
In early 1959, two of Cochran's friends, [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], along with [[the Big Bopper]], were [[The Day the Music Died|killed in a plane crash]] while on tour on February 3, 1959. Cochran's friends and family later said that he was badly shaken by their deaths, and he developed a morbid premonition that he also would die young. Shortly after their deaths, Cochran recorded a song (written by disc jockey Tommy Dee) in tribute to them, "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]". He was anxious to give up life on the road and spend his time in the studio making music, thereby reducing the chance of suffering a similar fatal accident while touring. Financial responsibilities, however, required that Cochran continue to perform live, and that led to his acceptance of an offer to tour the [[United Kingdom]] in 1960.

=== United Kingdom tour (1960) ===
Organized and promoted by [[Larry Parnes]], Cochran and [[Gene Vincent]] toured the United Kingdom from January through to April 1960.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk/tour/eddie-cochran-jan-april-1960/ |title = Eddie Cochran – Jan / April 1960 « American Rock n Roll the UK Tours|website=Americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk}}</ref> On the bill, they were accompanied by British acts [[Billy Fury]], [[Joe Brown (musician)|Joe Brown]], [[Vince Eager]], and [[Tony Sheridan]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Edwardian Teddy Boy - 1960 Tour of Vincent & Cochran |url=https://www.edwardianteddyboy.com/page64.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.edwardianteddyboy.com}}</ref> At the beginning of the tour, Cochran first performed a memorable show in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]] at the cinema venue [[Regent Theatre, Ipswich|Ipswich Gaumont]]. Cochran was backed by [[Marty Wilde]]'s band The Wildcats throughout the 1960 tour, exposing the British audience to live American rock 'n' roll. [[Georgie Fame]], then a member of the Beat Boys and the backing band for Vincent, recollected, "I remember Eddie playing guitar and we were astounded."<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2022-07-05 |title=MOJO Time Machine: Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran Join First All-Star Tour |url=https://www.mojo4music.com/time-machine/1960s/mojo-time-machine-gene-vincent-and-eddie-cochran-join-first-all-star-tour/ |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=Mojo |language=en}}</ref> During the progression of the tour, Cochran's fiancé [[Sharon Sheeley]] had flown in from America and joined them in late March.

== Personal life ==
Cochran dated singer-songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]]. As a songwriter, Sheeley worked in the music business and for manager Jerry Capehart. She wrote "[[Love Again (Sharon Sheeley song)|Love Again]]" and "Cherished Memories" for Cochran, and the 1959 hit song "Somethin' Else" with Eddie's brother Bill Cochran.<ref name=":5">[[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Leigh, Spencer]] (May 19, 2002).

In 1988, [[Levi Strauss & Co.]] promoted their Levi's 501 range with a television commercial called ''Eddie Cochran'', directed by Syd Macartney.<ref name=":5" /> It told the story of how Sheeley (played by actress Sharon Devlin) attracted Cochran at the 1958 party by wearing said product. It was supposedly narrated by Sheeley. The background song, "C'mon Everybody", was released as a promotional single, followed by a compilation album of Cochran's hits.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Levi's 501 commercial (Cochran) (1988) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOCMP3H2OCc |access-date=May 29, 2024 |website=YouTube| date=January 7, 2009 }}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Eddie Cochran Memorial, Rowden Hil, Chippenham - May 2021.jpg|thumb|Eddie Cochran Memorial, Rowden Hill, Chippenham]]
On the night of April 16, 1960, Cochran and his friend and fellow performing artist, [[Gene Vincent]], had just finished performing at the last of their scheduled concerts at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]]. They were traveling along the [[A4 road (England)#Chippenham to Bath (12.7 miles)|Bath Road]] in a taxi (a cream-coloured 1960 model [[Ford Consul#Ford Consul Mark II (1956–1962)|Ford Consul Mark II]] saloon) from [[Bristol]] towards [[London]] to [[Heathrow Airport]]. In addition to Cochran and Vincent, the other passengers in the vehicle were Sharon Sheeley, Patrick Tompkins (the tour manager, 29 years old), and George Martin (the 19-year-old taxi driver). At about 11:50&nbsp;p.m. that night, Martin lost control of the vehicle, which crashed into a concrete lamppost at Rowden Hill in [[Chippenham]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Simmonds|first=Jeremy|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|chapter=Introduction|page=xii|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago|year=2008|isbn=978-1-55652-754-8}}</ref> At the moment of impact, Cochran (who was seated in the center of the back seat) threw himself over Sheeley to shield her. The force of the collision caused the left rear passenger door to open,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eddie-cochran.info/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422182106/http://www.eddie-cochran.info/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=April 22, 2006|title=Link Alternatif SBOBET|website=Eddie-cochran.info}}</ref> and Cochran was ejected from the vehicle, sustaining a massive [[traumatic brain injury]] from [[blunt force trauma]] to the skull or a [[cerebral contusion]]. The road was dry, and the weather was good, but the vehicle was later determined to be travelling at an excessive speed.<ref name=Stanton2003>{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Scott|edition=2|title=The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians|chapter=Eddie Cochran|pages=50–53|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=2003|isbn=978-0743463300}}</ref> No other vehicle was involved in the incident.<ref name=Stanton2003/>

The occupants of the vehicle were all taken to Chippenham Community Hospital and later transferred to St. Martin's Hospital in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Cochran never regained consciousness and died, aged 21, at 4:10&nbsp;p.m. the following day – Easter Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eddie-cochran.info/IMAGES/The%20Crash_files/CR_17.JPG|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140130114505/http://www.eddie-cochran.info/IMAGES/The%20Crash_files/CR_17.JPG|url-status=usurped|archive-date=January 30, 2014|title=Certified Copy of an Entry of Death: Edward Ray Cochran|publisher=County Borough of Bath|date=July 2, 1960|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Sheeley suffered injuries to her back and thigh, Vincent suffered a fractured collarbone and severe injuries to his legs, and Tompkins sustained facial injuries and a possible fracture of the base of the skull. Martin did not sustain significant injuries.

Vincent and Sheeley returned to the United States after the accident. Cochran's body was flown home, and after a funeral service was buried on April 25, at [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Cypress, California]].<ref name=Cochran2003/> In August 1960, Sheeley told ''[[Photoplay]] magazine'', that Cochran said to her on his last day, just before entering the taxi to the airport, "You know, Shari, I've got a queer feeling that Fate’s not going to let us [be together]. Something awful is going to happen— I can feel it."<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Martin was convicted of dangerous driving, fined £50 (and in default of payment six months' imprisonment), and disqualified from driving for 15 years.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Gene Vincent & Eddie Cochran|last=Collis|first=John|date=August 19, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-7535-4783-0|language=en}}</ref> His driving disqualification was lifted on May 7, 1968, after the judge at [[Bristol Crown Court|Bristol Assizes]] determined that Martin "had suffered considerable financial hardship".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000560/19680508/009/0002?browse=False|title=15-year ban on driver lifted|access-date=February 26, 2020|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|page=2|date=May 8, 1968}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The car and other items from the crash were impounded at the local police station until a coroner's inquest could be held.

While they were preparing to board their taxi, Vincent and Cochran rebuffed musician [[Tony Sheridan]]'s request to ride along with them, resulting in Sheridan's avoiding involvement in the accident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/radio/doconone/771586-are-you-tony-sheridan|title=Are you Tony Sheridan?|date=February 29, 2016|website=Rte.ie}}</ref>

== Legacy ==

=== Posthumous releases and honors ===
A posthumous album, ''[[My Way (Eddie Cochran album)|My Way]]'', was released in 1964. Cochran was a prolific performer, and the British label Rockstar Records has released more of his music posthumously than was released during his life. The company is still looking for unpublished songs. One of his posthumous releases was "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]", a tribute to J.P. Richardson, better known as [[the Big Bopper]], and Cochran's friends [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], who had all [[The Day the Music Died|died in a plane crash]] just one year earlier. Written just hours after the tragedy by disc jockey Tommy Dee, it was recorded by Cochran two days later (Dee recorded his own version several weeks later). His voice broke during the spoken lyrics about Valens and Holly.

In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=RRHOF/> His pioneering contribution to the genre of rockabilly has also been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. Several of his songs have been re-released since his death, such as "C'mon Everybody", which was a number 14 hit in 1988 in the UK. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked him number 84 on its 2003 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

On September 27, 2010, the mayor of [[Bell Gardens, California]], declared October 3, 2010, to be "Eddie Cochran Day" to celebrate the famous musician who began his career when living in that city.

On June 10, 2022, Cochran's hometown of [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]] renamed James Street to Eddie Cochran Street in his honor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Leddy |first=Darian |date=June 10, 2022 |title=Albert Lea street renamed to honor musician Eddie Cochran |url=https://www.kttc.com/2022/06/10/albert-lea-street-renamed-honor-musican-eddie-cochran/ |website=[[KTTC]]}}</ref>

''The Very Best of Eddie Cochran'' was released by EMI Records on June 2, 2008.

==Style and influence==
Cochran was one of the first rock-and-roll artists to write his own songs and overdub tracks. He is also credited with being one of the first to use an unwound third string to "bend" notes up a whole tone—an innovation (imparted to UK guitarist Joe Brown, who secured much session work as a result) that has since become an essential part of the standard rock guitar vocabulary. 

Cochran was well known for playing the [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar, with a Wild West "G" branded into the body’s bass bout.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dregni |first=Michael |date=2022-08-10 |title=Eddie Cochran's Gretsch 6120 {{!}} Vintage Guitar® magazine |url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/39893/eddie-cochrans-gretsch-6120/ |access-date=2024-05-29 |language=en-US}}</ref> In 2010, [[Gretsch|Gretch]] and [[Fender (company)|Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]] announced the [https://www.gretschguitars.com/gear/build/hollow-body/g6120-eddie-cochran-signature-6120-hollow-body-with-bigsby/2401259822 G6120 Eddie Cochran Signature Hollow Body model], based on Cochran's original modified Gretsch.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fender Musical Instruments Corporation |title=G6120 Eddie Cochran Signature Hollow Body with Bigsby®, Rosewood Fingerboard, Western Maple Stain |url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/gear/build/hollow-body/g6120-eddie-cochran-signature-6120-hollow-body-with-bigsby/2401259822 |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=www.gretschguitars.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2010-01-06 |title=NAMM 2010: Gretsch announces Eddie Cochran tribute guitar |url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/namm-2010-gretsch-announces-eddie-cochran-tribute-guitar-231446 |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=MusicRadar |language=en}}</ref>

On July 6, 1957, McCartney met [[John Lennon]] at the [[St Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool|St. Peter's Church]] and performed a few songs for him, including Cochran's "Twenty Flight Rock". Lennon was so impressed that he invited McCartney to play in his band, [[the Quarrymen]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eh8BedNtLgC |title=Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now |date=1998-10-15 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-8050-5249-7 |pages=26 |language=en}}</ref>

'''Elvis Aaron Presley'''{{efn|name=name|Although some pronounce his surname {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɛ|z|l|i}} {{respell|PREZ|lee}}, Presley himself pronounced it {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɛ|s|l|i}} {{respell|PRESS|lee}}, as did his family and those who worked with him.{{sfn|Elster|2006|p=391}}<p>The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate. The physician who delivered him wrote "Elvis Aaron Presley" in his ledger.{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} The state-issued birth certificate reads "Elvis Aron Presley". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, "especially on legal documents".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as official.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}}}} (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), known [[Mononym|mononymously]] as '''Elvis''', was an American singer and actor. Known as the "'''King of Rock and Roll'''", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[civil rights movement|transformative era in race relations]], brought both great success and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley#Danger to American culture|initial controversy]].

Presley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]; his family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed him for the rest of his life. Presley's first RCA Victor single, "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular [[rock and roll]]; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans<ref name=":00" /> led to him being widely considered a [[moral panic|threat]] to the moral well-being of [[White Americans|white American]] youth.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=55}}

In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into [[Military career of Elvis Presley|military service in 1958]], he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.

Presley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time, with sales estimated around 500&nbsp;million records worldwide.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales}} He was commercially successful in many genres, including [[Traditional pop|pop]], country, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, [[adult contemporary]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. He won three [[Grammy Awards]], received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]]. He holds several records, including the most [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and the most number-one singles by any act on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], to Gladys Love ({{née|Smith}}) and Vernon Presley.{{sfn|Eames|2022a}}{{sfn|Eames|2022b}} Elvis' twin Jesse Garon was delivered 35 minutes before, [[Stillbirth|stillborn]].{{sfn|Earl|2017}} Presley became close to both parents, especially his mother. The family attended an [[Assembly of God]] church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}} Vernon moved from one [[Handyman|odd job]] to the next,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11–12, 23–24}}{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=419}} and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of [[Cheque fraud|altering a check]] and was jailed for eight months.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}}

In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as "average".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=15–16}} His first public performance was a singing contest at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang "Old Shep" and recalled placing fifth.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=17–18}} A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday;{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=19}}{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=101}} he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very [[shyness|shy]] about it."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}

In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a "trashy" kid who played [[hillbilly music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23–26}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s radio show. He was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates. Slim showed Presley chord techniques.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=19–21}} When his [[Mentorship|protégé]] was 12, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=95–96}}

In November 1948, the family moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=32–33}} Enrolled at [[Humes Preparatory Academy Middle School|L. C. Humes High School]], Presley received a C in [[Music education|music]] in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=36}} He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally [[bullying|bullied]] by classmates for being a "[[mama's boy]]".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=35–38}} In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of [[Lee Denson]], a neighbor. They and three other boys, including two future [[rockabilly]] pioneers, brothers [[Dorsey Burnette|Dorsey]] and [[Johnny Burnette]]—formed a loose musical collective.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=40–41}}

During his junior year, Presley began to stand out among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his [[sideburns]] and styled his hair. He would head down to [[Beale Street]], the heart of Memphis' thriving [[blues]] scene, and admire the wild, flashy clothes at [[Lansky Brothers]]. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} He competed in Humes' Annual "Minstrel" Show in 1953, singing and playing "[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: <blockquote>I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show&nbsp;... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=52–53}}</blockquote>

Presley, who could not [[Musical notation|read music]], played by ear and frequented record stores that provided [[jukebox]]es and listening booths. He knew all of [[Hank Snow]]'s songs,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} and he loved records by other country singers such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis]], and [[Bob Wills]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his [[ballad]]-singing style.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46–48, 358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48, 77–78}} Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as [[WDIA]], that played what were then called "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-heavy [[rhythm and blues]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=38–40}} Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights [[Racial segregation in the United States|designated for exclusively white audiences]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} Many of his future recordings were inspired by local [[African-American music]]ians such as [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus Thomas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=205}} [[B.B. King]] recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.{{sfn|Szatmary|1996|p=35}} By the time he graduated high school in June 1953, Presley had singled out music as his future.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=54}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=8}}

[[File:PresleyPromo1954PhotoOnly.jpg|alt=Elvis in a tuxedo|thumb|left|Presley in a [[Sun Records]] promotional photograph, 1954|upright=1.0]]
In August 1953, Presley checked into [[Sun Studio|Memphis Recording Service]], the company run by [[Sam Phillips]] before he started [[Sun Records]]. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: "[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]" and "[[That's When Your Heartaches Begin]]". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he "sounded like". Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62–64}} In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun—"I'll Never Stand in Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an [[audition]] for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} and another for the band of [[Eddie Bond]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}
{{Listen|type=speech|filename=That's All Right.ogg|title="That's All Right" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a "lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence."{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}
Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield "Scotty" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10–11}} The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "[[That's All Right]]". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them." Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94–97}} Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey [[Dewey Phillips]] (no relation to Sam Phillips) played "That's All Right" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–101}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song, [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury-rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A-side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102–104}}

==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====
The trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} Later that month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. Here Elvis pioneered "[[Rubber legs|Rubber Legs]]", his signature dance movement.{{sfn|Miller|2021}}{{sfn|Rodman|2013|p=151}} A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108–111}} Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}

Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]] became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house [[western swing]] band resumed.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=139}} Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117–127, 131}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on October 2; ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128–130}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37–38}}

==== ''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances ====
In November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''—the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127–128, 135–142}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175 ({{Inflation|US|175|1954|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) and his trio began playing in new locales, including [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}} Presley made his first television appearance on the [[KSLA-TV]] broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167–168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6–12}}
[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, September 1956 01.jpg|thumb|230px|Presley performing with [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] in 1956]]
In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed the top country star [[Eddy Arnold]], Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, [[Hank Snow]]. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167–168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6–12}}

By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a [[hillbilly]]."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as "rockabilly". At the time, Presley was billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}

Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him."{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217–219}}

At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28–29}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28–29}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary [[royalty payment|royalties]] in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=36, 54}}{{refn|In 1956–57, Presley was also credited as a co-writer on several songs where he had no hand in the writing process: "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]"; "[[Don't Be Cruel]]"; all four songs from his first film, including the title track, "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]"; "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]"; and "[[All Shook Up]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=35, 51, 57, 61, 75}} (Parker, however, failed to register Presley with such musical licensing firms as [[ASCAP]] and its rival [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], which eventually denied Presley annuity from songwriter's royalties.) Presley received credit on two other songs to which he did contribute: he provided the title for "[[That's Someone You Never Forget]]" (1961), written by his friend and former Humes schoolmate [[Red West]]; they collaborated with another friend, guitarist Charlie Hodge, on "[[You'll Be Gone]]" (1962).{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=157–158, 166, 168}}|name=cowriter|group=lower-alpha}} By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=29}}

=== 1956–1958: commercial breakout and controversy ===
==== First national TV appearances and debut album ====
[[File:Elvis Presley- Billboard ad 1956.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine advertisement, March 10, 1956]]
On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA Victor in Nashville.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} Extending his by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and ''Hayride'' pianist [[Floyd Cramer]]—who had been performing at live club dates with Presley—RCA Victor enlisted guitarist [[Chet Atkins]] and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular [[Jordanaires]] quartet.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=235–136}} The session produced the moody "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", released as a single on January 27.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} Parker brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'' for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]". In February, Presley's "[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}

RCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs, a bouncy pop tune, and what would centrally define the evolving sound of [[rock and roll]]: "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic [[Robert Hilburn]]—and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire, covers of [[Little Richard]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[The Drifters]]. As described by Hilburn, these <blockquote>were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}}</blockquote> It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for ten weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}

==== ''Milton Berle Show'' and "Hound Dog" ====
[[File:Elvis signs autographs in Minneapolis 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Presley signing autographs in [[Minneapolis]] in 1956]]
On April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''. His performance, on the deck of the [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS ''Hancock'']] in [[San Diego]], California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=262–263}} A few days later, Presley and his band were flying to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over [[Arkansas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=267}} Twelve weeks after its original release, "Heartbreak Hotel" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week [[concert residency|residency]] at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].{{sfn|Koch |Manning |Toplikar |2008}} The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests, "like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party", a ''[[Newsweek]]'' critic wrote.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=274}} Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} He began a tour of the [[American Midwest|Midwest]] in mid-May, covering fifteen cities in as many days.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=72–73}} He had attended several shows by [[Freddie Bell and the Bellboys]] in Vegas and was struck by their cover of "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]", a hit in 1953 for blues singer [[Big Mama Thornton]] by songwriters [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. It became his new closing number.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=273, 284}}

After a show in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. It warned that <blockquote>Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States.&nbsp;... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.&nbsp;... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium.&nbsp;... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls&nbsp;... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph.{{sfn|Fensch|2001|pp=14–18}}</blockquote>

Presley's second ''Milton Berle Show'' appearance came on June 5 at [[NBC]]'s Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. [[Milton Berle]] persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an up-tempo rendition of "Hound Dog" and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} His gyrations created a storm of controversy.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=49}} [[Jack Gould]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, <blockquote>Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.&nbsp;... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.&nbsp;... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body&nbsp;... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.{{sfn|Gould|1956}}</blockquote> Ben Gross of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.&nbsp;... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis&nbsp;... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and [[bordello]]s".{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}} [[Ed Sullivan]], whose [[The Ed Sullivan Show|variety show]] was the nation's most popular, declared Presley "unfit for family viewing".{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "childish".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=100}}

==== ''Steve Allen Show'' and first Sullivan appearance ====
[[File:Elvis Presley and Ed Sullivan October 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Photo of Elvis and Ed Sullivan|[[Ed Sullivan]] and Presley during rehearsals for his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', October 26, 1956]]
The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in New York. [[Steve Allen|Allen]], no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white bowtie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a [[basset hound]] wearing a top hat and bowtie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd&nbsp;... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition".{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=13}} Allen later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" and worked him into the "comedy fabric" of his program.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=270}} Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, "I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance."{{sfn|Rock 'N Roll Stars|1956|p=5}} Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=73}} Later that night, he appeared on ''[[Hy Gardner Calling]]'', a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him, Presley responded, "No, I haven't... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.&nbsp;... how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?"{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}}

The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", "[[Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be)|Any Way You Want Me]]" and "[[Don't Be Cruel]]". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on ''The Steve Allen Show''; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=51}} In August, a judge in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=80–81}} The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for thirty-six years.{{sfn|Whitburn|1993|p=5}} Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood in early September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog", contributed "[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=60–65}}

Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in the ratings. Sullivan booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.{{sfn|Edgerton|2007|p=187}} Actor [[Charles Laughton]] hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} According to legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows, Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock.&nbsp;... I think it's a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] bottle.&nbsp;... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=93}} Sullivan publicly told ''[[TV Guide]]'', "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots."{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=338}}{{sfn|Gibson|2005}} Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}} More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' that made Presley a national celebrity.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}}

Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the "biggest pop craze" since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp; and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: <blockquote>As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.{{sfn|Jezer|1982|p=281}}</blockquote>

==== Crazed crowds and film debut ====
[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, March 1957 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Elvis performing on stage|Presley performing live at the Mississippi-Alabama Fairgrounds in Tupelo, September 26, 1956]]

The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."{{sfn|Moore|Dickerson|1997|p=175}} At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=343}} ''[[Elvis (1956 album)|Elvis]]'', Presley's second RCA Victor album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick, "the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm" showed "the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=335}} Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through ''Elvis'', rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}

{{Listen|filename=Hound Dog & intro (live-Ed Sullivan 2).ogg|title="We're gonna do a sad song&nbsp;..." |description=Presley's definition of rock and roll included a sense of humor—here, during his second Sullivan appearance, he introduces one of his signature numbers.}}
Presley returned to ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] burned him in [[effigy]].{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} His first motion picture, ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original title—''[[Reno Gang|The Reno Brothers]]''—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.{{sfn|O'Malley|2016}}

On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] were recording, and had an impromptu [[jam session]] along with [[Johnny Cash]]. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the "[[Million Dollar Quartet]]" recordings.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=71}} The year ended with a front-page story in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22&nbsp;million on top of his record sales,{{sfn|Palladino|1996|p=131}} and ''Billboard''{{'}}s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=37}} In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}}

==== Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice ====
Presley made his third and final ''Ed Sullivan Show'' appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.{{sfn|Gibson|2005}}{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|pp=117–118}} In any event, as critic [[Greil Marcus]] describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a [[pasha]], if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', with all stops out."{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, "[[Peace in the Valley]]". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy".{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=90}} Two days later, the Memphis [[Conscription in the United States|draft board]] announced that Presley would be [[class 1-A|classified 1-A]] and would probably be drafted sometime that year.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=95}}

Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "[[Too Much (Elvis Presley song)|Too Much]]", "[[All Shook Up]]", and "[[(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released: ''The New York Times'' reported that pressings of his music on [[Ribs (recordings)|discarded X-ray plates]] were commanding high prices in [[Leningrad]].{{sfn|Salisbury|1957|p=4}} Presley purchased his 18-room mansion, [[Graceland]], on March 19, 1957.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=395–397}} Before the purchase, Elvis recorded ''[[Loving You (soundtrack)|Loving You]]''—the soundtrack to [[Loving You (1957 film)|his second film]], which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the ''Jailhouse'' sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck charm".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=406–408, 452}} "He was fast," said Leiber. "Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=178}} The [[Jailhouse Rock (song)|title track]] became another [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|number-one hit]], as was the [[Jailhouse Rock (EP)|''Jailhouse Rock'' EP]].{{sfn|Leigh|2017|p=187}}

Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=399–402, 428–430, 437–440}} A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} [[Villanova University|Villanova]] students pelted the singer with eggs in [[Philadelphia]],{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} and in [[Vancouver]] the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}} Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.&nbsp;... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.&nbsp;... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=104}} Asked for a response, Presley said: <blockquote>I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=437}}</blockquote>

Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of ''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]''. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: "[[Santa Claus Is Back in Town]]", an [[innuendo]]-laden blues.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=431}} The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the [[List of best-selling Christmas albums in the United States|best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States]],{{sfn|Grein|2008}}{{sfn|Caulfield|2016}} with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide.{{sfn|Baird|2017}} After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned, though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=431–435}}

On December 20, Presley received his draft notice, though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film ''[[King Creole]]''. A couple of weeks into the new year, "[[Don't (Elvis Presley song)|Don't]]", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number-one seller. Recording sessions for the [[King Creole (soundtrack)|''King Creole'' soundtrack]] were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=448–449}} As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off.{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=99, 105}}

On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the [[United States Army]] at [[Fort Chaffee Maneuver Training Center|Fort Chaffee]] in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers accompanied him into the installation.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=461–474}} Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=27}}

Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure at age 46.

While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to [[amphetamines]] and became "practically evangelical about their benefits", not only for energy but for "strength" and weight loss.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=21}} Karate became a lifelong interest: he studied with [[Jürgen Seydel]],{{sfn|Tillery|2013|p=60}}{{sfn|Eiland|2018}} and later included it in his live performances.{{sfn|Corcoran|1998}}{{sfn|Tillery|2013|loc=Chapter 5: Patriot}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=47, 49, 55, 60, 73}} Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity.

In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career. In [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]], he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve as a regular soldier.{{sfn|Presley|1985|p=40}} Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA Victor producer [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] and [[Freddy Bienstock]] of Hill and Range had carefully prepared: armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=107}} Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top-40 hits, including "[[Wear My Ring Around Your Neck]]", the bestselling "[[Hard Headed Woman]]", and "[[One Night (Elvis Presley song)|One Night]]" in 1958, and "[[(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I]]" and the number-one "[[A Big Hunk o' Love]]" in 1959.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=520}} RCA Victor also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully ''[[Elvis' Golden Records]]'' (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=278}}

(song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight?]]", along with the rest of ''[[Elvis Is Back!]]'' The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of [[Chicago blues]] "menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from [[Boots Randolph]]. Elvis' singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic."{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=279–280}} The record "conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things", according to music historian John Robertson: "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=50}} Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.{{sfn|"Red Carpet"|1960}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=124–127, 414}}

[[File:Juliet Prowse-Elvis Presley in G.I. Blues.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Presley with [[Juliet Prowse]] in ''[[G.I. Blues]]'']]
Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis|The Frank Sinatra Timex Special]]''. Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62–63}}

''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I. Blues]]'', the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'', followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely "a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}

==== Lost in Hollywood ====
Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted [[musical comedy|musical comedies]]. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein—''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a "pantheon of bad taste".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine, declared, "A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood."{{sfn|Fields|2007}}

Of Presley's films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—Presley frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: "three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew "progressively worse".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}}
[[File:Elvis Presley and Priscilla with Lisa Marie February 1968.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Presley and his wife, [[Priscilla Presley]], holding their newborn daughter, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in 1968]]
In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]" (1961) and "[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: "[[Crying in the Chapel]]" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was "arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}

Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261–263}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. "By then, of course, the damage had been done", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. "Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans."{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}

Presley's only child, [[Lisa Marie Presley|Lisa Marie]], was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=171}} Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, none higher than number 28.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=521}} His forthcoming soundtrack album, ''[[Speedway (album)|Speedway]]'', would rank at number 82. Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}

Recorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, simply called ''Elvis'', aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked: <blockquote>There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}}</blockquote> Marsh calls the performance one of "emotional grandeur and historical resonance".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}

By January 1969, the single "[[If I Can Dream]]", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what "he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man."{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.{{'"}}{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}}

==== ''From Elvis in Memphis'' and the International ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Power of My Love.ogg|title="Power of My Love" |description=Beginning with his American Sound recordings, [[soul music]] became a central element in Presley's fusion of styles. Here, he revels in lyrics full of sexual innuendos.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=277}}}}
Buoyed by the experience of the ''Comeback Special'', Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at [[American Sound Studio]], which led to the acclaimed ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]''. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is "a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single "[[In the Ghetto]]", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since "Bossa Nova Baby" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: "[[Suspicious Minds]]", "[[Don't Cry Daddy]]", and "[[Kentucky Rain]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=419}}

Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the ''Comeback Special'', offers came in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker {{US$|28,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|28000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for a one-week engagement. He responded, "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand-new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Costume designer [[Bill Belew]], responsible for the intense leather styling of the ''Comeback Special'', created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=343}} Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346–347}}

Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, "Can't Help Falling in Love" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149–150}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as "The King", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. "No," Presley said, "that's the real king of rock and roll."{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''[[Newsweek]]'' commented, "There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars."{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley "supernatural, his own resurrection."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis]]'' came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. "Suspicious Minds" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop number-one]] in over seven years, and his last.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|pp=521–522}}

[[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas. She recalled of their encounter, "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked [[marijuana]], and he was just appalled."{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley also rarely drank—several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.{{sfn|Mason|2007|p=81}}

==== Back on tour and meeting Nixon ====

Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album ''[[On Stage (Elvis Presley album)|On Stage]]''.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=94}} In late February, Presley performed six attendance-record–breaking shows at the [[Houston Astrodome]].{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=95}} In April, the single "[[The Wonder of You#Elvis Presley version|The Wonder of You]]" was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary]] chart as well. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|50000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows.

''[[That's the Way It Is (Elvis Presley album)|That's the Way It Is]]'', produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, <blockquote>The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}}</blockquote> After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the [[Southern United States|South]], his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], followed in November.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=99}}

On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]], where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the [[hippie]]s to help combat the [[drug culture]] he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge, to signify official sanction of his efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he "retain his credibility".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=419–422}} Presley told Nixon that [[the Beatles]], whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era,{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=284, 286, 307–308, 313, 326, 338, 357–358}} exemplified what he saw as a trend of [[anti-Americanism]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=420}} Presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the Beatles at his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air, California]], in August 1965. [[Paul McCartney]] later said that he "felt a bit betrayed.&nbsp;... The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's early death linked to [[prescription drug abuse]].{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=192}}

The [[United States Junior Chamber|U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce]] named Presley one of its annual [[Ten Outstanding Young Americans|Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation]] on January 16, 1971.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=321}} Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of [[U.S. Route 51|Highway 51 South]] on which Graceland is located "Elvis Presley Boulevard".

Best received by critics was ''[[Elvis Country]]'', a [[Concept album|concept record]] that focused on genre standards.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=319}} The biggest seller was ''[[Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas]]''. According to Greil Marcus, <blockquote>In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of "[[Merry Christmas Baby]]", a raunchy old [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]] blues.{{nbsp}}[...] If [Presley's] sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=284–185}}</blockquote>

MGM filmed Presley in April 1972 for ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'', which went on to win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film]] for [[30th Golden Globe Awards|that year's Golden Globe Awards]]. His gospel album ''[[He Touched Me (album)|He Touched Me]]'', released that month, would earn him his second [[Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance]].

''[[Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden]]'' became one of Presley's biggest-selling albums.

[[File:Elvis and Priscilla Presley after divorce hearing.jpg|left|thumb|259x259px|Elvis and [[Priscilla Presley]] after their divorce was finalized in 1973]]
Presley and his wife had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting.

In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the [[Kui Lee]] Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]'', which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, ''Aloha from Hawaii'' aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan, where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week, it smashed viewing records. The next night, it was simulcast to twenty-eight European countries, and in April an extended version aired in the U.S., receiving a fifty-seven percent share of the TV audience.{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|pp=61, 67, 73}} Over time, Parker's claim that it was seen by one billion or more people{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=73}} would be broadly accepted,{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=364}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=475}} but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention.{{sfn|Fessier|2013}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sun |first=Bruce Fessier |title=Director remembers landmark Elvis Presley performance |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/05/10/elvis-presley-aloha-from-hawaii/2151617/ |access-date=2024-08-12 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US |quote=Those figures now seem dubious.

At a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presley's defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, Presley raged, "There's too much pain in me&nbsp;... Stone [must] die." His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, [[Red West]], his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a [[contract killing]] and was relieved when Presley decided, "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=488–490}}

=== 1973–1977: health deterioration and death ===
==== Medical crises and last studio sessions ====
Presley's divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=329}} By then, his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his primary care physician, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley "felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519–520}}

Presley's condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] remembered his arrival at a [[University of Maryland]] concert: "He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, 'Is the tour gonna happen'?"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=547}} Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled: <blockquote>He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.&nbsp;... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.&nbsp;... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions.{{sfn|Hopkins|1986|p=136}}</blockquote>

RCA began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=560}} Parker delivered RCA another concert record, ''[[Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=336}} Recorded on March 20, it included a version of "[[How Great Thou Art]]" that won Presley his third and final [[Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=381}}{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} All three of his competitive Grammy wins{{snd}}out of fourteen total nominations{{snd}}were for gospel recordings.{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} Presley returned to the recording studio in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=584–585}} In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=593–595}} However, the recording process had become a struggle for him.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=595}}

==== Final months ====

After Presley's relationship with Linda Thompson ended,{{sfn|Gostin|2023}} he began dating Ginger Alden in November 1976; he proposed marriage to Alden two months later.{{sfn|Speakman|2023}}

Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that, by early 1977, "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts."{{sfn|Scherman|2006}} According to Andy Greene of ''Rolling Stone'', Presley's final performances were mostly "sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch."{{sfn|Greene|2018}} In [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], he was on stage for less than an hour and "was impossible to understand".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=628}} On March 31, he canceled a performance in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=628–630}}

Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualism]] books".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=634}} Presley's cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite [[Monty Python]] sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=212, 642}}

"[[Way Down]]", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, was released on June 6, 1977. That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special, ''[[Elvis in Concert]]'', to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Two days later, in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], South Dakota, "he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was "framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Presley's final concert was held in [[Indianapolis]] at [[Market Square Arena]], on June 26, 1977.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=23}}

On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to [[Portland, Maine]], to begin another tour. That afternoon, however, his fiancée Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion.{{sfn|Alden|2014}} Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at [[Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis|Baptist Memorial Hospital]] at 3:30&nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=645–648}} He was 42.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=242}}

President [[Jimmy Carter]] issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of American popular culture".{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted {{US$|18000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|18000|1977|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the ''[[National Enquirer]]''{{'}}s biggest-selling issue ever.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=386}} Alden struck a $105,000 ({{Inflation|US|105000|1977|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) deal with the ''Enquirer'' for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=660}} Presley left her nothing in his [[will and testament|will]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=581–582}}

Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on August 18. Outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third.{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=26}} About 80,000 people lined the processional route to [[Forest Hill Cemetery (Memphis, Tennessee)|Forest Hill Cemetery]], where Presley was buried next to his mother.{{sfn|Pendergast|Pendergast|2000|p=108}} Within a few weeks, "Way Down" topped the country and UK singles chart.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}}{{sfn|Warwick|Kutner|Brown|2004|pp=860–866}} Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=660}}

=== Cause of death ===
While an [[autopsy]] undertaken the same day Presley died was still in progress, Memphis [[Coroner|medical examiner]] Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that "drugs played no role in Presley's death".{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} In fact, "drug use was heavily implicated" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered "[[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported "fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651–653}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of [[depressant]]s had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: "Elvis had  an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call."{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}}

The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was [[cardiac arrhythmia]], a condition that can be determined only in a living person; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}} While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, George C. Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability, the facts were startling: "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of [[sedative]]s, [[amphetamine]]s, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name." Nichopoulos' license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}

In 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack."{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then."{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11–14}} One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, <blockquote>could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with [[diabetes]], glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and [[methadone]] treatments.{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11–14}}</blockquote>

=== Later developments ===
Between 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}} Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=433}} The residence was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2006.{{sfn|National Park Service|2010}}

Presley has been inducted into five music [[Hall of fame|halls of fame]]: the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1986), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1998), the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2001), the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] (2007), and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] (2012). In 1984, he received the [[Blues Music Award|W. C. Handy Award]] from the [[Blues Foundation]] and the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the [[American Music Award]]s' Award of Merit.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=33}}

A [[Tom Holkenborg|Junkie XL]] remix of Presley's "[[A Little Less Conversation]]" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") was used in a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertising campaign during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's number-one hits, ''[[ELV1S]]'', which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the ''Billboard'' chart for the first time in almost three decades.{{sfn|Garrity|2002}}

In 2003, a remix of "[[Rubberneckin']]", a 1969 recording, topped the U.S. sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of "That's All Right" the following year.{{sfn|Bronson|2004|p=1}} The latter was an outright hit in Britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in Canada.{{sfn|"Hits of the World"|2004}} In 2005, another three reissued singles, "Jailhouse Rock", "One Night"/"I Got Stung", and "It's Now or Never", went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all eighteen of Presley's previous chart-topping UK singles. The first, "All Shook Up", came with a collectors' box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top five.{{sfn|Sexton|2007}}

In 2005, [[Forbes (magazine)|''Forbes'' magazine]] named Presley the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid dead celebrity|top-earning deceased celebrity]] for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of $45&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Goldman|Ewalt|2007}} He was placed second in 2006,{{sfn|Rose|2006}} returned to the top spot the next two years,{{sfn|Goldman|Paine|2007}}{{sfn|Hoy|2008}} and ranked fourth in 2009.{{sfn|Pomerantz et al.|2009}} The following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income ever—$60&nbsp;million—spurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s ''[[Viva Elvis]]'' show in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Rose et al.|2010}} In November 2010, ''[[Viva Elvis (album)|Viva Elvis: The Album]]'' was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks.{{sfn|Baillie|2010}}{{sfn|Bouchard|2010}} As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products,{{sfn|Lynch|2011}} and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity.{{sfn|Pomerantz|2011}} Six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of $35&nbsp;million, up $8&nbsp;million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, Elvis Presley's Memphis, and hotel, The Guest House at Graceland.{{sfn|Greenburg|2017}}

In 2018, RCA/[[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]] released ''[[Where No One Stands Alone (album)|Elvis Presley – Where No One Stands Alone]]'', a new album focused on Presley' love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and [[Andy Childs]], the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album's title track.{{sfn|Legacy|2018}}

In 2022, [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s film ''[[Elvis (2022 film)|Elvis]]'', a biographical film about Presley's life, was released. Presley is portrayed by [[Austin Butler]] and Parker by [[Tom Hanks]]. As of August 2022, the film had grossed $261.8 million worldwide on a $85 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all-time behind ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' (2018), and the [[List of highest-grossing films in Australia|fifth-highest-grossing Australian-produced]] film.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Presley's earliest musical influence came from [[gospel music|gospel]]. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, "he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=14}} In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the [[Ellis Auditorium]], where groups such as the [[The Statesmen Quartet|Statesmen Quartet]] led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:

{{blockquote|The Statesmen were an electric combination&nbsp;... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world&nbsp;... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's.&nbsp;... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. "He went about as far as you could go in gospel music," said [[Jake Hess]]. "The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows." Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements&nbsp;... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48}}}}

[[Early life of Elvis Presley#Teenage life in Memphis|As a teenager]], Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, "He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, "I know practically every religious song that's ever been written."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}

=== Musicianship ===
Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.{{sfn|Graceland Blog|2015}} Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums. Presley played piano on songs such as "[[Old Shep]]" and "First in Line" from his 1956 album ''[[Elvis (1956 album)|Elvis]]''.{{sfn|Osborne|2017|p=[{{GBurl|id=CE6JPQyNKawC|p=73}} 73]}} He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' and "[[Moody Blue (Elvis song)|Moody Blue]]", and on "[[Unchained Melody]]", which was one of the last songs that he recorded.{{sfn|Duffett|2018|p=[{{GBurl|id=a7hJDwAAQBAJ|p=189}} 189]}} Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight]]".{{sfn|Murray|1961|p=65}} At one point during the [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]], Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as "[[Baby What You Want Me to Do]]" and "[[One Night (Elvis Presley song)|One Night]]".{{sfn|Marcus|2015|p=[{{GBurl|id=trEBDAAAQBAJ|p=341}} 341]}} The album ''[[Elvis is Back!]]'' features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as "[[I Will Be Home Again]]" and "[[Like a Baby]]".{{sfn|Eder|2013|p=[{{GBurl|id=XcYIAgAAQBAJ|pg=PT149}} 149]}}

=== Musical styles and genres ===

Presley was a central figure in the development of [[rockabilly]], according to music historians. "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label," writes Craig Morrison.{{sfn|Morrison|1996|p=x}} Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as "essentially&nbsp;... an Elvis Presley construction", with the defining elements as "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} In "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, "a combination of [[Merle Travis]]–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} While Katherine Charlton calls Presley "rockabilly's originator",{{sfn|Charlton|2006|p=103}} [[Carl Perkins]], another pioneer of rock'n'roll, said that "[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly".{{sfn|Jancik|1998|p=16}} According to [[Michael Campbell (pianist and author)|Michael Campbell]], the first major rockabilly song was recorded by [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]].{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=161}} In Moore's view, "It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old."{{sfn|Guralnick|1989|p=104}}

At RCA Victor, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars,{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense manner.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=39}} While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard "[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]" at Sun Records to the country ballad "How's the World Treating You?" on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of "Santa Claus Is Back in Town". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Run On.ogg|title="Run On" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition. The arrangement evokes "the percussive style of the 1930s [[Golden Gate Quartet]]."{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=22}}{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=184}}}}
After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five "[[She's Not You]]" (1962) "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as "[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]" and "[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number-one in 1960. "It's Now or Never", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song "{{lang|nap|[['O sole mio]]|italic=no}}" and concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142–143}}

While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become "hard to find".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis in Memphis'', as well as "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}

=== Vocal style and range ===
[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the [[CBS]] program ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'', January 16, 1956]]

The developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from "high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the "vocal stutter" on 1955's "[[Baby Let's Play House]]".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on "Don't Be Cruel", Presley "slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses," he shows "how masterful his relaxed style really is."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on "Can't Help Falling in Love" as one of "gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing", with the line {{"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}

Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions", as Presley "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax", becoming "a kind of one-man quartet".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds "[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand by Me]]" from the same gospel sessions "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on "Where No One Stands Alone", resorting "to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: "The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}

Marsh praises his 1968 reading of "[[U.S. Male]]", "bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on "In the Ghetto" is, according to Jorgensen, "devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms", instead relying on the exceptional "clarity and sensitivity of his voice".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of "almost translucent eloquence&nbsp;... so quietly confident in its simplicity".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On "Suspicious Minds", Guralnick hears essentially the same "remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise", but supplemented with "an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}

Music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that "Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, "from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was "variable and unpredictable" at the bottom, "often brilliant" at the top, with the capacity for "full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all."{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}

=== Relationship with the African-American community ===
[[File:BillyWard n Elvis Presley circa 1955.jpg|thumb|Elvis Presley and [[Billy Ward (singer)|Billy Ward]], circa 1955]]
When Dewey Phillips first aired "That's All Right" on Memphis' [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–101}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]—the originator of "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw."{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley "cracked Memphis' segregation laws" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its "colored night".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex."<ref name=":00" />

Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." A journalist with the national African American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''Jailhouse Rock'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: <blockquote>I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.{{sfn|Williams|2012}}</blockquote> Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}

The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had "stolen" black music still found adherents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ushe |first1=Naledi |title=Appropriation or appreciation?

Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that]."{{sfn|Osborne|2000|p=207}} Nine years earlier, he had said, "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=198}}

Girls!]]'' (1962), visualizing Presley's sex symbol image]]
Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", according to critic [[Mark Feeney]].{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} Television director Steve Binder reported, "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence."{{sfn|Ashley|2009|p=76}} His performance style was equally responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Critic [[George Melly]] described him as "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=58}} In his Presley obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him with bringing "overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58–59}} Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.{{sfn|Garber|1997|p=366}}

While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, ''[[Sight and Sound]]''{{'}}s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as "aggressively bisexual in appeal".{{Sfn|Dyer|1959–1960|p=30}} Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the title dance sequence in ''Jailhouse Rock'' within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image".{{sfn|Farmer|2000|p=86}} In the analysis of [[Yvonne Tasker]], "Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display."{{sfn|Tasker|2007|p=208}}

Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with Hollywood stars and starlets, from [[Natalie Wood]] in the 1950s to [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1960s to [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Cybill Shepherd]] in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=109}}

Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.{{sfn|Collins|2002}} As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.{{sfn|Sadie|1994|p=638}} With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=94}}

In this regard, [[Little Richard]] said of Presley, "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=193}} [[Al Green]] agreed: "He broke the ice for all of us."{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=356}}

President [[Jimmy Carter]] remarked on Presley's legacy in 1977: "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture."{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.{{sfn|Arnett|2006|p=400}}

For much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the [[American Dream]].{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=xv}}{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=149}} In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony.{{sfn|Cosby|2016|p=144}}{{sfn|Doll|2016|p=186}} Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy [[Southern cooking]] of his upbringing, foods such as [[chicken-fried steak]] and [[biscuits and gravy]].{{sfn|Martin|2000}}{{sfn|Smith|2002}} In particular, his love of fried [[peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich|peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches]],{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=227, 256}}{{sfn|Martin|2000}} now known as "Elvis sandwiches",{{sfn|Wilson|2010|p=121}} came to symbolize this characteristic.{{sfn|Slater|2002}}

Since 1977, there have been numerous [[Elvis sightings|alleged sightings of Presley]]. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death.{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=42, 157–160, 169}}{{sfn|Clarke|2006|pp=77, 80}} Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=159–160}} An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=10}} On the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual.{{sfn|Segré|2002}} "With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death", writes Ted Harrison. "He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation."{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=10}}

On the 25th anniversary of Presley's death, ''The New York Times'' asserted: <blockquote>All the talentless impersonators and appalling [[velvet Elvis|black velvet paintings]] on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.&nbsp;... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.{{sfn|New York Times|2002}}</blockquote>

He was ranked third on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of greatest artists. [[Bono]] wrote in appreciation: <blockquote>In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness — the gospel highs. The mud — the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.{{sfn|Bono|2010|loc="Elvis"}}</blockquote>

 Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:<blockquote>Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.&nbsp;... Elvis has emerged as a great ''artist'', a great ''rocker'', a great ''purveyor of schlock'', a great ''heart throb'', a great ''bore'', a great ''symbol of potency'', a great ''ham'', a great ''nice person'', and, yes, a great American.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=141–142}}</blockquote>

''Billboard'' now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens. ''Billboard'' now states that they yielded just two number ones and a total of two top tens, voiding the separate chart appearances of "Hound Dog" and "I Beg of You".|name=billboard|group=lower-alpha}} According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with [[Madonna]];{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=875}} per ''Billboard''{{'}}s current assessment, he ranks second with 36.{{sfn|Hasty|2008}} Whitburn and ''Billboard'' concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that [[Mariah Carey]] is second with 19.{{sfn|Trust|2022}} Whitburn has Presley with 18:{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=875}} ''Billboard'' has him third with 17.{{sfn|Moody|2008}} According to&nbsp;''Billboard'',&nbsp; Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone at 80, according to Whitburn and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=876}}{{sfn|RRHF|2010}} with only Mariah Carey having more with 91 weeks.{{sfn|Trust|2023}} He holds the records for most number-one singles on the UK chart with 21 and singles reaching the top ten with 76.{{sfn|Myers|2022}}{{sfn|Myers|2021}}

As an album artist, Presley is credited by ''Billboard'' with the record for the most albums charting in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]: 129, far ahead of second-place Frank Sinatra's 82. He also holds the record for most cumulative weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 for a male solo artists: 67 weeks{{sfn|Trust|2015}} In 2015 and 2016, two albums setting Presley's vocals against music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, ''[[If I Can Dream (album)|If I Can Dream]]'' and ''[[The Wonder of You (Elvis Presley album)|The Wonder of You]]'', both reached number one in the UK. This gave him a new record for number-one UK albums by a solo artist with 13, and extended his record for longest span between number-one albums by anybody—Presley had first topped the British chart in 1956 with his self-titled debut.{{sfn|Sexton|2016}}

== Discography ==
{{Main|Elvis Presley albums discography|Elvis Presley singles discography|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley}}

A vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as 665{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=438}} and 711.{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} His career began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music. For his albums, the distinction between "official" studio records and other forms is often blurred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

'''Vincent Eugene Craddock''' (February 11, 1935 – October 12, 1971), known as '''Gene Vincent''', was an American [[rock and roll]] musician who pioneered the style of [[rockabilly]]. His 1956 top ten hit with his backing band [[the Blue Caps]], "[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly.<ref name=pc8/> His chart career was brief, especially in his home country of the US, where he notched three top 40 hits in 1956 and 1957, and never charted in the top 100 again.  In the UK, he was a somewhat bigger star, racking up eight top 40 hits from 1956 to 1961.

Vincent was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker the "Screaming End".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-12 |title=Gene Vincent: The hero before The Beatles |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/gene-vincent-heror-the-beatles/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|title=GENE VINCENT|first=Ian|last=Chaddock|website=Vivelerock.net|access-date=May 22, 2021|archive-date=December 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228151827/https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Craddock was born February 11, 1935, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=Concise |page=1218}}</ref> to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock.<ref name="musicianguide.com">{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000576/Gene-Vincent.html|title=Gene Vincent Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>  His musical influences included [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. His favorite composition was [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont overture]]. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now [[Virginia Beach]]), in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]], Virginia, near the [[North Carolina]] line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.

Craddock's father volunteered to serve in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German [[U-boat]]s during [[World War II]]. Craddock's mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop.

Craddock dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler {{USS|Chukawan|AO-100|6}}, with a two-week training period in the repair ship {{USS|Amphion|AR-13|6}}, before returning to the ''Chukawan''. He never saw combat but completed a [[Korean War]] deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} but was not part of the ship's company.

Craddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycle. On July 4, 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was shattered in an auto crash.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henderson|first=Derek|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70671058|title=Gene Vincent: a companion|year=2005|publisher=Spent Brothers Productions|isbn=0-9519416-7-4|location=Southampton|page=3|oclc=70671058}}</ref> He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain. He wore a steel sheath as a [[leg brace]]<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean-Éric |last1=Perrin |author-link1=:fr:Jean-Éric Perrin |first2=Jerôme |last2=Rey |first3=Gilles |last3=Verlant |author-link3=Gilles Verlant |title=Les Miscellanées du rock |year=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Fetjaine / La Martinière |page=252 |isbn=978-2-35425-130-7 |quote=Gene choisit de se faire poser une gaine d'acier autour des restes de son membre}}</ref> for the rest of his life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John

===Early music career===
Craddock became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene Vincent and formed a rockabilly band, Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LatestNewsGV.html|title=Official Gene Vincent website|publisher=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=2014-04-24|archive-date=November 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105110313/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LatestNewsGV.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band included Willie Williams on rhythm guitar (replaced in late 1956 by [[Paul Peek]]), Jack Neal on upright bass, Dickie Harrell on drums (died May 31, 2023, at age 82),<ref name="obiDH">{{cite web |url=https://www.lovingfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Richard-Harrell-6/#!/Obituary|title=Richard Dickie Be-Bop Harrell Sr.|date=|accessdate=July 8, 2023|website=lovingfuneralhome.com}}</ref> and [[Cliff Gallup]] on lead guitar.<ref name="Larkin"/> He also collaborated with another rising musician, [[Jay Chevalier]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]]. Vincent and His Blue Caps soon gained a reputation playing in various [[country music|country]] bars in Norfolk. There they won a talent contest organized by a local radio DJ, "Sheriff Tex" Davis, who then became Vincent's manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711034403/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 11, 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London, UK|title=Sheriff Tex Davis|date=September 13, 2007|access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Biggest hits===

"Be-Bop-a-Lula" was not on Vincent's first album and was picked by Capitol producer [[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]] as the B-side of his first single, "Woman Love". Prior to the release of the single, Lowery pressed promotional copies of "Be-Bop-a-Lula" and sent them to radio stations throughout the country. By the time Capitol released the single, "Be-Bop-a-Lula" had already gained attention from the public and radio DJs. The song was picked up and played by other U.S. radio stations (obscuring the original A-side song) and became a hit, peaking at number 7 and spending 20 weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=152}} and reaching number 5 and spending 17 weeks on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' chart,<ref>{{cite web|date=|title=Cash Box Country Singles 11/03/56|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210311111104/http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|archive-date=March 11, 2021|website=CASHBOX Magazine|access-date=March 11, 2021}}</ref> and launching Vincent's career as a rock-and-roll star.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32014167|title=Billboard's hottest hot 100 hits|date=1995|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=0-8230-7646-6|edition=|location=New York|pages=253|oclc=32014167}}</ref>

After "Be-Bop-a-Lula" became a hit, Vincent and His Blue Caps were unable to follow it up with the same level of commercial success, although they released critically acclaimed songs like "Race with the Devil" (number 96 on the ''Billboard'' chart and number 50 on the ''Cash Box'' chart) and "[[Bluejean Bop]]" (number 49 on the ''Billboard'' chart and another million-selling disc).<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

Cliff Gallup left the band in 1956, and Russell Williford joined as the new guitarist for the Blue Caps. Williford played and toured Canada with Vincent in late 1956 but left the group in early 1957. Gallup came back to do the next album and then left again. Williford came back and exited again before Johnny Meeks joined the band.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dregni|first=Michael|date=2019-04-22|title=Cliff Gallup|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/32416/cliff-gallup/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210303103647/https://www.vintageguitar.com/32416/cliff-gallup/|archive-date=March 3, 2021|website=Vintage Guitar® magazine|access-date=March 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Kevin|date=2009-02-01|title=Russell Williford.

Vincent and His Blue Caps also appeared several times on ''[[Town Hall Party]]'', California's largest country music barn dance, held at the Town Hall in Compton, California.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hillbilly-Music.com |url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/programs/story/index.php?prog=170 |title=Town Hall Party|publisher=hillbilly-music.com |access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref> They appeared on October 25, 1958, and July 25 and November 7, 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808469645/details |title=Gene Vincent – At Town Hall Party Production Details|publisher=Movies.yahoo.com|access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref>  However, by the end of 1959 the Blue Caps were no longer part of the billing on Gene Vincent records.  The late 1959 single "Wild Cat" was credited solely to Gene Vincent, and this would be the case on all subsequent Gene Vincent releases.

===Europe===
A dispute with the [[Internal Revenue Service|US tax authorities]] and the American Musicians' Union over payments to his band and his having sold the band's equipment to pay a tax bill led Vincent to leave the United States for Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farren|first=Mick|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/784882138|title=The Mammoth Book of Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll.|publisher=Constable & Robinson|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84901-461-8|editor-last=Driver|editor-first=Jim.|location=London|pages=50–51|chapter=Gene Vincent – The Genesis of the Dark Side|oclc=784882138}}</ref>

On December 15, 1959, Vincent appeared on [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]]'s TV show, ''Boy Meets Girl'', his first appearance in England. He wore black leather, gloves, and a medallion, and stood in a hunched posture.<ref name="Larkin"/> Good is credited with the transformation of Vincent's image.<ref name="Larkin"/> After the TV appearance he toured France, the Netherlands, [[West Germany|Germany]] and the [[UK]] performing in his US stage clothes.<ref>Farren, Mike (2004).

On April 16, 1960, while on tour in the UK, Vincent, [[Eddie Cochran]] and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]]. Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and further damaged his weakened leg.<ref name="Larkin"/> Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day. Vincent returned to the United States after the accident.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While they were preparing to board their taxi, Vincent and Cochran had rebuffed [[Tony Sheridan]]'s request to ride along with them to the next venue. After escaping that fateful road accident,<ref>https://www.rte.ie/radio/doconone/771586-are-you-tony-sheridan Martin Duffy. ''Are You Tony Sheridan?'' (RTÉ [[Doc on One]] radio documentary), 17 July 2010.</ref> Sheridan soon relocated to Hamburg, where he helped influence the musical training of many British groups who would later become part of the [[British Invasion]], including one of his backing bands, [[the Beatles]].

Promoter [[Don Arden]] had Vincent return to the UK in 1961 to do an extensive tour in theatres and ballrooms,<ref name="Larkin"/> including the Agincourt Ballroom, Camberley<ref name=":0">Ronnie Wood (Show) in conversation with Paul McCartney confirmed meeting Vincent at the venue. sky.com/ronnie</ref> with Chris Wayne and the [[The Echoes (English group)|Echoes]]. In 1962 Vincent was on the same bill as the Beatles in Hamburg; Paul McCartney recalled an incident with a pistol at Vincent's girlfriend's hotel.<ref name=":0" /> In 1963 Vincent appeared in court for pointing a gun at his then wife Margaret Russell and threatening to kill her, though his wife said in court that she had forgiven him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spentbrothers.com/archives/2005/06/02/singer_who_pointed_gun_at_wife_says_she_forgives_me/|title=Gene Vincent &#124; Singer who pointed gun at wife says 'She forgives me'|website=Spentbrothers.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref> After the overwhelming success of the UK tour, Vincent moved to Britain in 1963.

Vincent toured the UK again in 1963 with the [[The Outlaws (UK band)|Outlaws]], featuring future [[Deep Purple]] guitar player [[Ritchie Blackmore]], as a backing band. Vincent's alcohol problems marred the tour, resulting in problems both on stage and with the band and management.<ref>Bloom, Jerry (2008). ''Black Knight''. Omnibus Press.</ref>

===Later career===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2014}}
Vincent's attempts to re-establish his American career in [[folk rock]] and [[country rock]] proved unsuccessful; he is remembered today for recordings of the 1950s and early 1960s released by [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In the early 1960s, he also put out tracks on EMI's [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, including a cover of [[Arthur Alexander]]'s "Where Have You Been All My Life?" A backing band called the Shouts joined him.

[[File:Genevincent015e.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Vincent, 1967]]
In 1966 and 1967, in the United States, he recorded for [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]], backed by ex-members of the [[the Champs|Champs]] and [[Glen Campbell]]. Challenge released three singles in the US, and the UK [[London Records|London]] label released two singles and collected recordings on to an LP, ''Gene Vincent'', on the UK London label in 1967. Although well received, none sold well. In 1968 in a hotel in Germany, Vincent tried to shoot Paul Raven, later to find fame as [[Gary Glitter]]. He fired several shots but missed and a frightened Raven left the country the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channelhopping.onthebox.com/2012/12/14/regrettable-television-this-your-life-gary-glitter|title=Regrettable Television: This Is Your Life, Gary Glitter|publisher=Channelhopping.onthebox.com|date=December 14, 2012|access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref>
 
In 1969, he recorded the album ''I'm Back and I'm Proud'' for long-time fan [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]],<ref name="Larkin"/> produced by [[Kim Fowley]] with arrangements by [[Skip Battin]] (of the [[the Byrds|Byrds]]), [[Mars Bonfire]] on rhythm guitar, Johnny Meeks (of Blue Caps and Merle Haggard's [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]]) on lead guitar, [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] on drums, and backing vocals by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and Jackie Frisco.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=34}} While recording the track "Sexy Ways" for the album Vincent threatened to get a gun from his car and shoot [[Paul A. Rothchild]] and [[John Densmore]] if they did not leave the studio; the pair then left the studio quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spentbrothers.com/archives/2011/03/16/im_back_and_im_proud/|title=Gene Vincent &#124; I'm Back and I'm Proud|website=Spentbrothers.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref> He recorded two other albums for [[Kama Sutra Records]], reissued on one CD by Rev-Ola in March 2008. On his 1969 tour of the UK he was backed by the [[The Wild Angels (band)|Wild Angels]], a British band that had performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. Because of pressure from his ex-wife Margaret Russell, the [[Inland Revenue]] and promoter [[Don Arden]], Vincent returned to the US.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagarty|first=Britt|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11869138|title=The day the world turned blue: a biography of Gene Vincent|date=1984|publisher=Blandford|isbn=0-7137-1531-6|location=Poole|pages=245|oclc=11869138}}</ref>

His final US recordings were four tracks for Rockin' Ronny Weiser's Rolling Rock label, a few weeks before his death. These were released on a compilation album of tribute songs, including "Say Mama", by his daughter, Melody Jean Vincent, accompanied by Johnny Meeks on guitar. On 19 September 1971, he began his last series of gigs in Britain.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=4}} He was backed by Richard Cole and Kansas Hook (Dave Bailey, Bob Moore, and bass player Charlie Harrison from Poco and Roger McGuinn's Thunderbyrd). They recorded four tracks ("Say Mama", "Be-Bop-A-Lula", "Roll Over Beethoven", "[[Distant Drums (song)|Distant Drums]]") at the BBC studios in [[Maida Vale]], London, for [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker's]] [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show. The fifth record ("[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]") remained unfinished.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=36}} He managed one show at the Garrick Night Club in [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], [[Lancashire]], and two shows at the Wookey Hollow Club in [[Liverpool]] on October 3 and 4. Vincent then returned to the US and died a few days later. In September, 1974, BBC launched pop label BEEB with a maxi single by Vincent ("Roll Over Beethoven", BEEB 001). The single comprised three of these tracks.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=BBC's BEEB to Bow With Maxi-Single |url= |magazine=Billboard |location= |publisher= |date=1974-09-14|page=56 |access-date=}}</ref> The four tracks are now on Vincent's album ''White Lightning''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Writing for [[AllMusic]], [[Ritchie Unterberger]] called Vincent "an American rockabilly legend who defined the greasy-haired, leather-jacketed, hot rods 'n' babes spark of rock and roll."<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Ritchie|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-vincent-mn0000803720|title=Gene Vincent|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] was less impressed by the musician's career, saying "Vincent was never a titan – his few moments of rockabilly greatness were hyped-up distillations of slavering lust from a sensitive little guy who was just as comfortable with 'Over the Rainbow' in his normal frame of mind." However, he included Vincent's [[compilation album]] ''The Bop That Just Won't Stop'' (1974) in his "basic record library", published in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981).<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: V|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=V&bk=70|access-date=March 21, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

'''Walter Louis Garland''' (November 11, 1930 – December 27, 2004), known professionally as '''Hank Garland''', was an American guitarist and songwriter. He started as a country musician, played rock and roll as it became popular in the 1950s, and released a jazz album in 1960. His career was cut short when a car accident in 1961 left him unable to perform.

The Hank Garland biopic ''Crazy'' was released in 2008.<ref name="Crazy">{{cite web |title=Crazy|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443474/|website=IMDB|access-date=11 November 2022}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Cowpens, South Carolina]],<ref name="AMbio">{{cite web |last1=Ginell |first1=Richard S. |title=Hank Garland |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hank-garland-mn0000666285/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> Garland began playing guitar at the age of six, and began to appear on local radio shows at 12.  At 14 he moved to [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] where he met [[Don Reno]] who gave him lessons, and worked with him on the [[WSPA-FM]] station in Spartanburg, both playing lead guitar. <ref name="Guitarist">{{cite magazine |title=Guitarist Hank Garland Dies |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65186/guitarist-hank-garland-dies |magazine=Billboard |access-date=16 January 2019 |date=28 December 2004}}</ref>

He moved to Nashville at age 16, staying in Ma Upchurch's boarding house, where he roomed with [[Bob Moore (musician)|Bob Moore]] and Dale Potter. At age 18, he recorded his million-selling hit "[[Sugarfoot Rag]]".<ref name="Campilongo">{{cite web |last1=Campilongo |first1=Jim |title=Listen to Hank Garland's 'Jazz Winds From a New Direction' – the Album That Made George Benson Want to Play Jazz |url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/listen-to-hank-garlands-jazz-winds-from-a-new-direction-the-album-that-made-george-benson-want-to-play-jazz |website=Guitar Player |language=en |date=20 January 2023}}</ref> He appeared on the ''Jubilee'' program with [[Grady Martin]]'s band and on ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]''. Garland is perhaps best known for his Nashville studio work with [[Elvis Presley]] from 1958 to 1961 which produced such rock hits as: "I Need Your Love Tonight", "A Big Hunk o' Love", " I'm Coming Home", "I Got Stung", "[[A Fool Such As I]]", "Stuck on You", "[[Little Sister (Elvis Presley song)|Little Sister]]", "[[(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame]]", and "I Feel So Bad". He worked with many country music and rock and roll musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s, such as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Mel Tillis]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Boots Randolph]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Moon Mullican]].

Garland's guitar drove such classic recordings as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]]' "I Got a Hole in My Pocket"; [[Benny Joy]]'s "Bundle of Love" and "I'm Gonna Move"; Jimmy Lloyd's (recorded under pseudonym of ([[Jimmie Logsdon]]) "You're Gone Baby" and "I've Got a Rocket in My Pocket"; [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s "You're Humbuggin' Me"; [[Simon Crum]]'s "Stand Up, Sit Down, Shut Your Mouth"; and [[Johnnie Strickland]]'s (1935-1994) "She's Mine"; plus, seasonal staples "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]" with [[Bobby Helms]], and [[Brenda Lee]]'s seasonal "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]". [[Don Gibson]]'s "Sweet Sweet Girl" and "Don't Tell Me Your Troubles"; [[Patsy Cline]]'s "Let the Teardrops Fall"; [[Ronnie Hawkins]]' "[[Jambalaya]]"; and [[Faron Young]]'s "Alone with You" spotlighted Garland's guitar work.

He played with [[George Shearing]] and [[Charlie Parker]] in New York and went on to record ''Jazz Winds from a New Direction''<ref name="Ginell">{{cite web |last1=Ginell |first1=Richard S. |title=Jazz Winds from a New Direction |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jazz-winds-from-a-new-direction-mw0000615502 |website=AllMusic |access-date=16 January 2019 }}</ref> with [[Gary Burton]] on vibraphone, [[Joe Benjamin]] on double bass, and [[Joe Morello]] on drums.<ref name="Campilongo" /> That session took place in Nashville in 1960.  

That same year, Garland, along with other members of the [[The Nashville A-Team|Nashville "A-Team"]] of session players, was invited to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].  For years, these musicians unwound by playing jazz after hours at Nashville's Carousel Club. The group included Gary Burton on vibes, guitarist [[Chet Atkins]], pianist [[Floyd Cramer]], saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]], bassist [[Bob Moore (musician)|Bob Moore]], drummer [[Buddy Harman]] and African-American violinist [[Brenton Banks]], who played in the string sections that adorned many Nashville recordings.  [[RCA Victor]] had a mobile recording unit there to record their performance, but when rioting prematurely ended the festival, the group performed (with the tapes rolling) on the porch of the mansion where they were staying.  The album was released as ''[[After the Riot in Newport]]''.

At the request of [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Guitar]] company president [[Ted McCarty]], Garland and guitarist [[Billy Byrd]]<ref name="Campilongo" /> influenced the design of the [[Gibson Byrdland|Byrdland]] guitar, which derived from the [[Gibson L-5]], having a slimmer body and shorter scale for ease of playing.<ref name="gibson">{{cite book |last1=Duchossoir |first1=Andre R. |title=Gibson Electrics: The Classic Years |date=1998 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corp |isbn=0-7935-9210-0 |pages=57–60}}</ref>

In September 1961, a car crash left Garland in a coma.<ref name="Guitarist" /> He regained consciousness and recovered with the help of his wife, Evelyn, and two daughters, but due to a brain injury sustained in the car accident, he was unable to return to the studios. After Evelyn died at the age of 38 in a car crash in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] on December 2, 1965, Garland's parents took care of him until their deaths. He then went to live with his brother, Billy and wife Amy. 

Garland suffered from constant ill health in his later years and died in [[Orange Park, Florida]] on December 27, 2004, of complications from a staph infection. He was 74 years old. He is interred in Jacksonville Memory Gardens in Orange Park.

'''Randall Hank Williams''' (born May 26, 1949), known professionally as '''Hank Williams Jr.''' or '''Bocephus''', is an American singer-songwriter and musician. His musical style has been described as a blend of [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]], and [[country music|country]]. He is the son of country musician [[Hank Williams]] and the father of musicians [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]] and [[Hank Williams III]], and the grandfather of [[Coleman Williams]]. He is also the half brother of [[Jett Williams]].

Williams began his career following in his famed father's footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a December 1963 episode of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ''[[Shindig!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929947/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t130|title=Hank Williams, Jr.|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref>

As Williams struggled to define his own voice and place within the [[country music]] genre, his style began slowly to evolve. His career was interrupted by a near-fatal fall while Williams was climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak in Montana]] on August 8, 1975.<ref name="People">{{cite journal|last=Buchalter|first=Gail|date=October 22, 1979|title=Hank Williams Jr. Fell Down a Mountain and Lived Now He's Climbing High on the C&w Charts|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=12|issue=17|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074883,00.html|access-date=August 3, 2013|archive-date=April 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425141320/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074883,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="TheFall">{{cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/the-fall/|title=The Fall|publisher=[[Country Music Hall of Fame]]|access-date=August 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104074223/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/the-fall/|archive-date=November 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After an extended recovery, he rebuilt his career in the [[country rock]] scene.<ref name=Burns/> As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of musical instrument skills includes guitar, bass guitar, [[upright bass]], [[steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[dobro]], piano, keyboards, saxophone, [[harmonica]], [[fiddle]], and drums.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hankjr.com/about/?id=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716224600/http://www.hankjr.com/about/?id=2|url-status=dead|title=Hank Williams Jr. – Official Website|archive-date=July 16, 2011|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> In 2020, Williams Jr. was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Paulson">{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/08/12/hank-williams-jr-marty-stuart-dean-dillon-country-music-hall-fame/3352839001/|title=Hank Williams Jr., Marty Stuart, Dean Dillon to enter the Country Music Hall of Fame|first=Matthew Leimkuehler and Dave|last=Paulson|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
Williams was born Randall Hank Williams on May 26, 1949, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. His [[Hank Williams|father]] nicknamed him Bocephus (after [[Grand Ole Opry]] comedian [[Rod Brasfield]]'s ventriloquist dummy).<ref>{{cite magazine|url =https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-awkward-enduring-influence-of-hank-williams-jr|title =The Awkward, Enduring Influence of Hank Williams, Jr.|magazine =The New Yorker|first =David|last =Cantwell|date =March 24, 2016}}</ref> After his father's death in 1953, he was raised by his mother, [[Audrey Williams]].

While he was a child, Williams was influenced by a <!--really? vast--> number of contemporary musicians who visited his family and taught him various musical instruments and styles. {{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Among these figures of influence were [[Merle Haggard]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. Williams first stepped onto the stage and sang his father's songs when he was eight years old.

He attended [[John Overton High School]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances with the choir.

== Career ==
In 1964, Williams made his recording debut with "[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]", one of his father's many classic songs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944–2006, Second edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=388 |language=en |isbn=0823082911 }}</ref>

He provided the singing voice of his father<ref name="pc9">{{Pop Chronicles |9 |4|Hank Williams Jr.}}</ref> in the 1964 film ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058765/ |title=Your Cheatin' Heart |date=December 1, 1964 |website=IMDb.com}}</ref> He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.<ref name="pc9" />

===A change in appearance and musical direction===
Although Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a "Hank Williams impersonator", he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.

By the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a pattern of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to [[Alabama]], in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with [[Southern rock]] musicians including [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Toy Caldwell]], and [[Charlie Daniels]]. ''[[Hank Williams Jr. and Friends]]'' (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.

On August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed while mountain climbing in southwestern [[Montana]]. While climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] ([[Idaho]] border) west of [[Jackson, Montana|Jackson]], the snow beneath Williams collapsed and he fell almost {{convert|500|ft}} onto rock, causing multiple severe skull and facial fractures.<ref name=singfll>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8R9OAAAAIBAJ&pg=1923%2C4536621 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Singer injured in fall |date=August 11, 1975 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-01-11-williams-miner-visit_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=USA Today | title=Hank Williams visits W.Va. mine survivor | date=January 11, 2006}}</ref> Williams spent two years recovering, re-learning how to talk and sing, and undergoing 17 surgeries to repair his skull and reconstruct his face. The accident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film ''[[Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story]]''. To hide his scars and disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a [[cowboy hat]]. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become Williams' [[trademark look|signature look]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

In 1977, Williams recorded and released ''One Night Stands'' and ''The New South'', and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song "Once and For All".{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} In 1980, he appeared on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-[[Dana Cooper]] Band.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

===Country music career===

[[File:HankWilliamsJrCollage-1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Williams performing at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, 2006]]

In 1976, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that Williams' "mainstream country material has always been among [[Nashville Tennessee|Nashville]]{{'}}s best".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Hank Williams Jr.: Hank William Jr. and Friends. By John Morthland : Articles, reviews and interviews from Rock's Backpages.| access-date = June 25, 2018| url = https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/hank-williams-jr-ihank-william-jr-and-friendsi|via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

He was prolific throughout the 1980s, sometimes recording and releasing two albums a year. ''[[Family Tradition (album)|Family Tradition]]'', ''[[Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound (album)|Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound]]'', ''[[Habits Old and New]]'', ''[[Rowdy (Hank Williams, Jr. album)|Rowdy]]'', ''[[The Pressure Is On]]'', ''[[High Notes]]'', ''[[Strong Stuff]]'', ''[[Man of Steel (album)|Man of Steel]]'', ''[[Major Moves (album)|Major Moves]]'', ''[[Five-O (album)|Five-O]]'', ''[[Montana Cafe]]'', and many others resulted in a long string of hits.

Between 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums—18 studio albums and three compilations—that were all certified at least [[Music recording certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No.&nbsp;1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No.&nbsp;1 singles, during his career.

In 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987–88, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the [[Academy of Country Music]]. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was ''[[Born to Boogie (album)|Born to Boogie]]''.

During the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams' songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as "Family Tradition", "Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound", "Old Habits", "Ain't Misbehavin{{'"}}, "[[Born to Boogie (song)|Born to Boogie]]", and "My Name Is Bocephus".

The hit single "[[Wild Streak]]" (1987) was co-written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]], for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records. In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, "[[If the South Woulda Won]]". The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

His 1989 hit "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]" was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named ''Video of the Year'' by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].

He is well known for his hit "[[A Country Boy Can Survive]]" and as the performer of the theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', based on his 1984 hit "[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]". In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for ''Monday Night Football'' earned him four [[Emmy Award]]s.

In 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]''. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit "A Country Boy Can Survive" after 9/11, renaming it "America Can Survive". In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on ''CMT Outlaws''. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.

He has also made a cameo appearance along with [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Kid Rock]], and [[Charlie Daniels]] in [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s music video for the song "[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]". He and Kid Rock also appeared in Wilson's "[[Redneck Woman]]" video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock's video "Only God Knows Why", and "Redneck Paradise".

In April 2009, Williams released a new single, "Red, White & Pink-Slip Blues", which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams' album ''[[127 Rose Avenue]]''. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, ''127 Rose Avenue'' was announced as his last album for Curb Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725202808/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 25, 2009|title=Hank Williams Jr. says new album is his last for Curb Records|last=Morris|first=Edward|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2009}}</ref>

For the [[2000 U.S. Presidential election|2000 U.S. presidential election]], he rerecorded his song "We Are Young Country" to "This is Bush-Cheney Country". On October 15, 2008, at a rally in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] for Republican presidential nominee [[John McCain]], he performed "McCain-Palin Tradition", a song in support of McCain and his running mate, [[Sarah Palin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/the_mccainpalin_tradition.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023625/http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/the_mccainpalin_tradition.php|url-status=dead|title="McCain–Palin Tradition"|archive-date=February 6, 2009|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> He has contributed to federal election campaigns, mostly to Republicans, including [[Michele Bachmann]]'s 2012 presidential campaign. However, he has donated to some Democrats in the past, most notably [[Jim Cooper]] and [[John S.

In November 2008, Williams considered a run for the 2012 Republican nomination as a [[U.S. Senator]] from Tennessee for the seat held by GOP incumbent [[Bob Corker]], although his publicist said regarding Williams "no announcement has been made".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2008/11/25/hank-williams-jr-for-senate |title=Hank Williams Jr. For Senate? - Real Clear Politics – TIME.com |publisher=Realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com |date=November 25, 2008 |access-date=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128170506/http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2008/11/25/hank-williams-jr-for-senate/|archive-date=January 28, 2012 }}</ref> Williams ultimately did not run.

===2011 ''Fox and Friends'' controversy===
In an October 3, 2011, interview with [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', Williams discussed a June golf game where President [[Barack Obama]] and Republican House Speaker [[John Boehner]] had teamed against Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]], saying the match was "one of the biggest political mistakes ever". When asked why the golf game troubled him, Williams stated, "Come on. That'd be like Hitler playing golf with [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]&nbsp;... in the shape this country is in?" He also said that the President and Vice President were "the enemy" and compared them to "the [[Three Stooges]]". Later, anchor [[Gretchen Carlson]] said to him, "You used the name of one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe, ''I think'', the president." Williams replied, "Well, that is true. But I'm telling you like it is." As a result of his statements, [[ESPN]] dropped Williams' opening song from its ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] versus the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and replaced it with the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Williams later said his analogy was "extreme – but it was to make a point", and "some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood&nbsp;... I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me – how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don't see eye to eye and never will". Additionally, Williams said he has "always respected the office of the president ... Working-class people are hurting – and it doesn't seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change". ESPN later said it was "extremely disappointed" in Williams' comments, and pulled his opening from that night's broadcast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |title=ESPN pulls Hank Williams Jr. intro after singer links Obama with Hitler |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=October 3, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113134647/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |archive-date=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

Three days later, ESPN announced Williams and his song would not return to ''Monday Night Football'', ending the use of the song that had been part of the broadcast on both ABC and ESPN since 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7066449/espn-hank-williams-jr-theme-song-return-monday-night-football|title=ESPN, Hank Williams Jr. part ways|date=October 6, 2010|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Williams expressed defiance and indifference on his website, and said he was the one who had made the decision. "After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision," he wrote. "By pulling my opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE. It's been a great run."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7066449/espn-hank-williams-jr-theme-song-return-monday-night-football |title=ESPN – Hank Williams Jr. theme song won't return to Monday Night Football – ESPN |publisher=ESPN |date=October 6, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011}}</ref> Williams' son, [[Hank Williams III]], stayed neutral in the debate, telling [[TMZ.com]] that most musicians, including his father, are "not worthy" of a political discussion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/10/04/hank-williams-jr-monday-night-football-son-politics-obama-hitler-fox-news-channel-jello-biafra-green-party-politics/ |title=Hank Williams Jr.'s Son – My Dad Should NOT Talk Politics |publisher=TMZ.com |date=November 22, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011}}</ref>

After his song was pulled from ''Monday Night Football,'' Williams recorded a song criticizing Obama, ESPN and ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', titled "[[Keep the Change (Hank Williams Jr. song)|Keep the Change]]". He released the track on [[iTunes]] and via free download at his website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2011/10/hank-williams-jr-retaliates-with-song-that-slams-fox/1|title=Hank Williams Jr. retaliates with song that slams Fox|first=Tom|last=Weir|date=October 10, 2011|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> The song garnered over 180,000 downloads in two days.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1672429/hank-williams-jr-thrives-with-downloads-media-coverage-surrounding-controversy.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104416/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1672429/hank-williams-jr-thrives-with-downloads-media-coverage-surrounding-controversy.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 14, 2011|title=Hank Williams Jr. Thrives With Downloads, Media Coverage Surrounding Controversy|date=October 12, 2011|publisher=[[CMT News]]}}</ref>

'''Hayden Thompson''' (born March 5, 1938) is an American singer, songwriter, and [[rockabilly]] musician.<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|page=442}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/HaydenThompson1.html |title=Hayden Thompson |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-02 |archive-date=October 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020062502/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/HaydenThompson1.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Thompson was born in [[Booneville, Mississippi]], United States.<ref name="Larkin50"/> At high school Thompson formed the Southern Melody Boys, who made a recording which led from a radio session. "I Feel the Blues Coming On" was sung by Thompson and gave them another radio appearance on the "[[Louisiana Hayride]]" show. Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  "Love My Baby" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Thompson's recording of "$16.88" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name="Larkin50"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades. These included ''The Time Is Now'' (1990).<ref name="Larkin50"/>

In 1978, Clement released a solo album, ''All I Want to Do in Life'', which generated three charting country singles.<ref name=MixDec2003/>

In 1987, Clement was approached by Irish rock band [[U2]] to record at [[Sun Studio]] in Memphis. He was not familiar with the band's music  but agreed to arrange the session. The resulting work appeared on U2's next album, ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'', ("[[When Love Comes to Town]]", with [[B.B. King]]; "Angel of Harlem", a tribute to [[Billie Holiday]]; and "Love Rescue Me", with backing vocals by [[Bob Dylan]]),<ref name="LarkinGE"/> as well as the [[Woody Guthrie]] song "Jesus Christ", which was included on the 1988 album ''Folkways: A Vision Shared — A Tribute to Woody Guthrie & Leadbelly''.

===Later life and death===
In November 2003, Clement performed his song made famous by Johnny Cash, "Guess Things Happen That Way", on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s ''Johnny Cash Memorial Tribute'' concert TV special.

He recorded a second solo album, ''Guess Things Happen That Way'', in 2004. His documentary, ''Cowboy Jack's Home Movies'' was named Best Documentary at the 2005 Nashville Film Festival. In 2005, a documentary about Clement, ''Shakespeare Was a Big George Jones Fan'', was created by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville.

'''Janis Darlene Martin''' (March 27, 1940 &ndash; September 3, 2007) was an American [[rockabilly]] and [[country music]] singer. She was one of the few women working in the male-dominated rock and roll music field during the 1950s and one of country music's early female innovators. Martin was nicknamed the Female Elvis for her dance moves on stage, similar to those of [[Elvis Presley]].

==Biography==
{{More citations needed |date=June 2018}}

===Early life and rise to fame===
Martin was born in [[Sutherlin, Virginia]], east of [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]. Her mother was a stage mother, and her father and uncle were both musicians. Before she was six, Martin was already singing and playing the guitar, inspired by [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Hank Williams]]. 
Over the years, this resulted in statewide contests with over 200 contestants, which she won. As a result, Janis was asked to play on the same bill as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Sunshine Sue]].  Through them Martin became a member of the [[Old Dominion Barn Dance|Old Dominion Barndance]] on [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]], which came out of Richmond every Saturday Night on CBS network. When she was in her mid-teens, she was appearing with country singers including Arnold, [[Hank Snow]], [[The Browns]] and [[Jim Reeves]].  She soon claimed she was tired of country music and began a rock and roll career.

===Teen rock and roll star===
The WRVA station announcer, Carl Stutz, wrote a song titled "Will You Willyum", and asked Martin to sing the song live on stage that Saturday night so that he could make a demo tape to send to his publisher in New York. A week later, Stutz called Martin to tell her that [[RCA Victor]] was interested in recording "Will You Willyum". As it happened, the publisher offered "Will You Willyum" to [[Steve Sholes]], a producer at RCA Victor, and asked whether Sholes had an artist to record it. Apparently Sholes replied "Well, who's the girl doin' the demo?"

At age 15, Martin signed with RCA Victor in March 1956, just two months after Elvis Presley joined the label. She recorded "Will You Willyum" on March 8, 1956, backed by her own composition "Drugstore Rock 'n Roll".

The song became the biggest hit of her career, selling 750,000 records. Soon Martin was performing on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]''. She also appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'', and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming one of the younger performers to ever appear. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her Most Promising Female Vocalist that year.

Presley and RCA were so impressed with Martin's stage presence that they dubbed her the Female Elvis.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 7, 1956 |title=Review spotlight on... |pages=44 |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=janis+martin+female+elvis&pg=PA44 |access-date=March 29, 2022}}</ref><ref>[[Sun Records]] also dubbed [[Jean Chapel]] the female Elvis Presley in 1956 when she began recording rockabilly songs including "I Won't Be Rocking Tonight".</ref> Presley sent a dozen red roses to her when she appeared at the RCA Victor convention in [[Miami, Florida]]. [[Colonel Tom Parker]], Elvis' manager, offered to take over her management seeing the potential of a successful double "boy-girl" bill. Just before, due to his extremely taxing touring schedule, Elvis had collapsed on stage in New York due to exhaustion. Safeguarding the young Janis Martin from this, her parents decided to not accept Parker's offer, and instead go with the head of the Old Dominion shows. RCA chose Martin to tour as a member of the [[Jim Reeves]] show and continued recording rock and roll and country material that ended up being successful on both charts, including "My Boy Elvis", "Let's Elope Baby", her cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s song "[[Ooby Dooby]]", and "[[Love Me to Pieces]]".

On January 7, 1956, Martin eloped with her boyfriend, a paratrooper. She told her parents of her marriage only after her husband was safely shipped overseas in Germany. Her father tried to have it annulled because she was only 15 years old. Eventually, the matter was left, but Janis' mother ordered her to keep her marriage a secret to safeguard her career. In 1957, Janis went on a [[USO]] tour in Europe with [[Jim Reeves]], [[Del Wood]] (a pianist famous for performing the song "Down Yonder"), [[The Browns]], and [[Hank Locklin]]. Her husband got a 30-day leave and went on the road with her, which resulted in her getting pregnant with her son. Martin's teenage pregnancy caused RCA Victor to drop her in 1958. It was probably during this period that a 10" LP album titled ''Janis and Elvis'' was released in South Africa. This was recalled immediately upon request from the U.S. because it suggested the idea that the two performers were singing together. Although [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] and [[Decca Records]] were interested, she signed with the Belgian label [[Palette Records|Palette]] in 1960.

===Later career===
By 1960, Martin was on her second marriage, and her husband demanded she leave the music business. In the 1970s, she began performing again with her newly formed band, The Variations. In 1975, she was working for the [[Halifax, Virginia]], Police Department when music historian Dennis West tracked her down. Edd Bayes, a record collector from Maryland, asked Dennis for her address, which Dennis gave to him. He then coaxed her to appear locally and tell her story in ''Goldmine'' magazine. Martin toured through Europe as part of the rockabilly revival there, and in 1979 Bayes convinced RCA to pull four Martin songs from their vault, which were then released on [[Dog Gone Records]] in 1977. Edd Bayes took one of the songs that had been recorded twice ("Love Me Love") at different tempos and added the 'cha cha' to the title. In the 1980s, the [[Bear Family]] label gathered Martin's complete record history with the compilation album ''The Female Elvis''. Since the early 1980s Janis started performing again at Rockabilly shows through Europe and the US. One of her live shows was released on a CD called ''Here I Am'' on [[Hydra Records]].  In 1995, Martin appeared on [[Rosie Flores]]'s ''Rockabilly Filly'' album for [[HighTone Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockabilly Filly Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263|website=AllMusic.com|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Flores recorded an album with Martin six months before her death, but it was not released until September 18, 2012, as [[The Blanco Sessions]] by [[Cow Island Music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Janis Martin, 'The Female Elvis,' Returns|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/30/161968431/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-returns|website=NPR Music|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Flores|first1=Rosie|title=JANIS MARTIN " The Female Elvis", Final Recording Sessions|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1383637978/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-final-recording-sess|website=Kickstarter|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref>

===Death===
Martin died from cancer on September 3, 2007, at [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Her only son, Kevin Parton, had died that January.

==Honors==
In 2010 the [[Library of Virginia]] posthumously honored Martin as a [[Virginia Women in History]] because of her musical career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Women in History: Janis Martin|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2010/honoree.asp?bio=8|publisher=Library of Virginia|access-date=4 March 2015}}</ref>

'''Jerry Lee Lewis''' (September 29, 1935{{snd}}October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer and songwriter. Nicknamed "'''The Killer'''", he was described as "[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. "[[Crazy Arms]]" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", "[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]", and "[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]".

His rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]] and had hits with songs such as "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321082649/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |url-status=live }}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included "[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]", "[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]", "[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]", and "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]".

Lewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s "Rockin' My Life Away". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.

Lewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Music Hall of Fame |url=http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |access-date=October 12, 2016 |website=Memphismusichalloffame.com |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009220210/http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022.

Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said of Lewis: "His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable [[boogie]]-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of [[The Void (philosophy)|the void]] make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller."<ref name="Christgau"/>

==Early life==
Jerry Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, to Elmo Kidd Lewis Sr. and Mary "Mamie" Herron Lewis in [[Ferriday, Louisiana]]. He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular televangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon – Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday. The hit of his set was his performance of [[R&B]] artist [[Stick McGhee]]'s "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Palmer |first=Robert |date=December 13, 1979 |title=The Devil and Jerry Lee Lewis |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-devil-and-jerry-lee-lewis-2-179111/ |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620171628/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-devil-and-jerry-lee-lewis-2-179111/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On the live album ''By Request, More of the Greatest Live Show on Earth'', Lewis is heard naming [[Moon Mullican]] as an artist who inspired him.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{Cite web |title=Moon Mullican {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=AllMusic |archive-date=August 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210804185528/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |url-status=live }}</ref>

His mother enrolled him at the [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University|Southwest Bible Institute]] in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], so that he could sing evangelical songs exclusively. When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of "My God Is Real" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some "worldly" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. After that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], becoming part of the burgeoning new [[rock and roll]] sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1952 for [[Cosimo Matassa]] in New Orleans.<ref name=jms>{{Cite web |last=Halsey |first=Jay |year=2021 |title=The Killer Rocks J&M |url=http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |website=The Cosimo Code |access-date=October 29, 2022 |archive-date=September 2, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220902142443/http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tomko|first=Gene|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Louisiana Musicians: Jazz, Blues, Cajun, Creole, Zydeco, Swamp Pop, and Gospel|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2020|isbn=978-0807169322|location=Baton Rouge|pages=160|access-date=December 1, 2021|archive-date=July 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173501/https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Around 1955, he traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he was already at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in [[Shreveport]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2012 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 21, 2021 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204174946/https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Career==
===J&M Studio===
Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s [[J&M Recording Studio]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. He covered [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s "Don't Stay Away (Till Love Grows Cold)" and his own instrumental composition "Jerry's Boogie" ({{aka}} New Orleans Boogie).<ref name=jms/>

===Sun Records===

[[File:GreenbackDollar.ogg|right|thumb|[[Sun Records]] artist [[Ray Harris]] singing the song "Greenback Dollar", with Lewis playing the piano]]
In November 1956, Lewis traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to audition for [[Sun Records]]. Label owner [[Sam Phillips]] was in Florida, but producer and engineer [[Jack Clement]] recorded Lewis's rendition of [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]'s "[[Crazy Arms]]" and his own composition "[[End of the Road (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|End of the Road]]". In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]", "[[Your True Love]]", and "Put Your Cat Clothes On" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s "Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll".

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]] and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8 /> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, were released on CD as ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's "[[Don't Be Cruel]]" and "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]", [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]", and [[Pat Boone]]'s "Don't Forbid Me".
[[File:Great Balls of Fire - You Win Again - Cash Box ad 1957.jpg|thumb|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' advertisement, November 16, 1957]] 
Lewis's own singles (on which he was billed as "Jerry Lee Lewis And His Pumping Piano") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]", a [[Big Maybelle]] cover, and "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame and criticism of the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. According to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to [[Hell]].<ref>Cash, Johnny (1997). ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. p. 98.</ref> This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.

As part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the [[piano bench]] aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keys, sat on the keyboard and stood on the piano. He told ''the [[Pop Chronicles]]'' that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act.<ref name="pc8">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19756/m1/ |title=Show 8 – The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the Rock-a-Billies.

His dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'' (he sang the title song from the back of a [[flatbed truck]]), and ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''.

In 1960, Phillips opened a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sam Phillips: The Sound and Legacy of Sun Records |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2001/nov/phillips/011128.sam.phillips.html |access-date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=npr.org |archive-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016031755/http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2001/nov/phillips/011128.sam.phillips.html |url-status=live }}</ref> abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Carl Perkins]], Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]], and others, and also opened a studio in [[Nashville]]. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of "[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]" (September 1962 UK) and "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]" (March 1963) entered the [[hit parade]]. On popular EPs, "Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes", "I've Been Twistin{{'"}}, "Money", and "Hello Josephine" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent [[discothèque]]s. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]]'s "[[In the Mood]]" was issued on the [[Phillips International Records|Phillips International]] label under the pseudonym "The Hawk".<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2012 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 22, 2021 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204174946/https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Marriage controversy===
Lewis's turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a May 1958 British tour where Ray Berry, a news agency reporter at London's [[Heathrow Airport]] (the only journalist present), learned about Lewis's third wife, Myra Gale Brown. She is Lewis's first cousin once removed<ref>{{Cite web |last=Devin Miller |date=April 17, 1998 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Online Wild One's Clubhouse: The Largest Jerry Lee Lewis Homepage on the Internet! |url=http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Jerry9.tripod.com |archive-date=June 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623135413/http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cecil Adams |date=October 1, 2004 |title=What's wrong with cousins marrying? |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041001.html |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=The Straight Dope |archive-date=May 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526033048/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041001.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><!-- DO NOT CHANGE COUSIN STATEMENT - SEE TALK PAGE --> and was 13 years old when they married—though Lewis, who was 22 years old at the time, claimed she was actually 15.

===Smash Records===
Lewis's Sun recording contract ended in 1963, and he joined [[Smash Records]], where he made several rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of [[Mercury Records]]) came up with "I'm on Fire", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as [[Colin Escott]] writes in the sleeve to the retrospective ''A Half Century of Hits'', "Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if [[the Beatles]] hadn't arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn't really know what to do with Lewis after that."<ref name="Escott">{{citation|title=A Half Century Of Hits|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/A_Half_Century_Of_Hits.html|type=CD liner|date=January 2006|author=Colin Escott|publisher=[[Time Life]]|access-date=October 30, 2022|archive-date=April 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420104332/http://albumlinernotes.com/A_Half_Century_Of_Hits.html|url-status=live}}</ref> One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European fans had shown for Lewis's firebrand rock and roll. In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the ''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV Royal Daffodil]]'', for a [[English Channel|cross-channel]] rock and roll cruise from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend, Essex]], to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]]. For this performance, he was backed by [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[The Outlaws (band)|the Outlaws]].<ref name="Bloom2009">{{Cite book |last=Jerry Bloom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5 |title=Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore |date=November 5, 2009 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=978-0-85712-053-3 |pages=100 |access-date=March 10, 2020 |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173507/https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5 |url-status=live }}</ref> None of Lewis's early Smash albums, including ''[[The Return of Rock]]'', ''[[Memphis Beat]]'', and ''[[Soul My Way]]'', were commercial successes.

===''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg''===
One major success during these lost years was the concert album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'', recorded with [[the Nashville Teens]] in 1964, which is considered one of the greatest live albums ever.<ref name="Checksfield">Checksfield, Peter (1995).

The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, "Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll..." The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that "''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion."

===Country comeback===
[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]
Frustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the [[Jerry Chesnut]] song "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 "looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956." The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with "Pen and Paper" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but "Another Place, Another Time" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.

Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", "To Make Love Sweeter For You", "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", "Since I Met You Baby", "Once More With Feeling", "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick "[[Nashville sound]]" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".

In a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, "[[One Minute Past Eternity]]", was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit "She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye". Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.

===Grand Ole Opry appearance===
Lewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', he had maintained an ambivalence to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: "It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't [[schmooze]] there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different."<ref name="Escott"/>

As recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]". Ignoring his allotted time constraints—and, thus, commercial breaks—Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]—the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager—out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On", "Workin' Man Blues", "Good Golly, Miss Molly", and a number of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021172629/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===
[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]
Lewis returned to the pop charts with "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]" in 1971 and "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut "Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee" was the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' was his highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, "the Killer" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: "During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog." During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, "Do you wanna try one?", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, "If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=The Vinyl District |archive-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115110247/http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was "Middle Age Crazy", which made it to number 4 in 1977.

===Later career===
[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]
In 1979, Lewis switched record labels to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.

In 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called "It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart had a complex relationship over the years.

Receiving positive reviews, the album charted on four different Billboard charts, including a two-week stay at number one on the Indie charts. A DVD entitled ''[[Last Man Standing Live]]'', featuring concert footage with many guest artists, was released in March 2007.

In June 1989, Lewis was honored for his contribution to the recording industry with a star along [[Hollywood Boulevard]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. On October 10, 2007, Lewis received the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's American Music Masters Award. His next album, ''[[Mean Old Man (album)|Mean Old Man]]'', was released in September 2010 and reached No. 30 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

On November 5, 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, honored Lewis with six days of conferences, interviews, a DVD premiere, and film clips, dedicated to him and entitled ''The Life And Music of Jerry Lee Lewis''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=https://www.classicbands.com/jerrylee.html |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=Classicbands.com |archive-date=April 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423140656/http://www.classicbands.com/jerrylee.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On November 10, the week culminated with a tribute concert compered by [[Kris Kristofferson]]. Lewis was present to accept the American Music Masters Award and closed his own tribute show with a rendition of "[[Over the Rainbow]]". On February 10, 2008, he appeared with [[John Fogerty]] and [[Little Richard]] on the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards|50th Grammy Awards]], performing "Great Balls of Fire" in a medley with "[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]". On June 4, 2008, Lewis was inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] and appeared on ''[[A Capitol Fourth]]'' and performed the finale's final act with a medley of "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]", "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On", and "Great Balls of Fire".

In December 2019, Lewis was honored with a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker at his ranch in [[Nesbit, Mississippi]] to celebrate his contributions to country music.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 19, 2019 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Receives Mississippi Country Music Trail Marker |url=https://visitmississippi.org/jerry-lee-lewis-receives-mississippi-country-music-trail-marker/ |website=Visit Mississippi |access-date=February 4, 2020 |archive-date=February 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204105154/https://visitmississippi.org/jerry-lee-lewis-receives-mississippi-country-music-trail-marker/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In May 2022, Lewis was announced as a member-elect to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], to be inducted in October 2022.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://eu.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/country-music-hall-fame-class-2022-inductees/9805843002/ |website=The Tennessean |first1=Marcus K. |last1=Dowling |first2=Dave |last2=Paulson |first3=Matthew |last3=Leimkuehler |date=May 17, 2022 | title=Keith Whitley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Joe Galante are headed to the Country Music Hall of Fame | access-date=May 17, 2022 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240823203032/https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/country-music-hall-fame-class-2022-inductees/9805843002/ |archive-date= 23 Aug 2024  }}</ref> "This year's inductees are trailblazers who each paved their own unique path within country music," Sarah Trahern, CMA chief executive officer, said.

In very different ways, they all have left a lasting impact on the industry and generations of fans alike. I am thrilled to welcome this deserving class to the Country Music Hall of Fame." "I'm just overwhelmed that they asked me here today," Lewis, 86, said during an event earlier that week at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, adding that his career had taught him to "be a good person and treat people right."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-rotunda/induction-ceremony-medallion/|title=Induction Ceremony Medallion |website=Country Music Hall of Fame |access-date=May 25, 2022|archive-date=July 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190714152827/https://countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-rotunda/induction-ceremony-medallion/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>supertalk.fm/jerry-lee-lewis-to-be-inducted-into-country-hall-of-fame/</ref>

===Piano style===
Lewis was an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Robert Fontenot |date=March 4, 2019 |title=Did Jerry Lee Lewis Really Set His Pianos on Fire Onstage? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/jerry-lee-lewis-setting-his-pianos-on-fire-on-stage-2523388 |access-date=October 1, 2019 |website=Thoughtco.com |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417065338/https://www.thoughtco.com/jerry-lee-lewis-setting-his-pianos-on-fire-on-stage-2523388 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style became synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players.

In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, [[Elton John]] recalls that up until "Great Balls of Fire", "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. My dad collected [[George Shearing]] records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." Lewis was primarily known for his "[[boogie-woogie]]" style, which is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on ''Memphis Sounds with [[George Klein (disc jockey)|George Klein]]'' in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice-looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much." Lewis also cited [[Moon Mullican]] as a source of inspiration.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Episode 59: "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" by Jerry Lee Lewis - A History Of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs |url=https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1437402802/a-history-of-rock-music-in-five-hundred-songs/episode-59-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on-by-jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=Poddtoppen |language=sv |archive-date=September 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922062821/https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1437402802/a-history-of-rock-music-in-five-hundred-songs/episode-59-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on-by-jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lewis's second marriage to Sally Jane Mitcham in September 1953, was of dubious validity because it occurred 23 days before his divorce from Barton was final. They had two children: Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. (1954–1973) and Ronnie Guy Lewis (b. 1956). After four years, he filed for divorce in October 1957.

===Religious beliefs===
As a teenager, Lewis studied at the Southwest Bible Institute in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], before being thrown out for playing a 'worldly' [[boogie-woogie]] version of "My God Is Real", and that early incident foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing "the devil's music". Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous ("How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because "only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]", and {{"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words... they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October–November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>

In the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, "The Bible doesn't even speak of religion. No word of religion is even in the Bible. ''Sanctification!'' Are you sanctified? Have you been ''saved''? See, I was a good preacher, I know my Bible? I find myself falling short of the glory of God."

Gospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire. After a string of hit country albums, he recorded [[In Loving Memories: The Jerry Lee Lewis Gospel Album|a gospel album]] for the first time in 1970 (it was released in 1971).<ref>{{Citation |title=Jerry Lee Lewis - In Loving Memories Album Reviews, Songs & More |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/in-loving-memories-mr0002561399 |work=AllMusic |language=en |access-date=October 30, 2022 |archive-date=October 30, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221030134931/https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/in-loving-memories-mr0002561399 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lewis was also a cousin of the televangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Jimmy Swaggart |url=https://archive.org/details/tocrossriver00swag |title=To cross a river |author2=Robert Paul Lamb |publisher=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-88270-221-6 |edition=3rd |location=Baton Rouge, La. |pages=1 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

===Graceland arrest===
[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis 1976 mugshot.jpg|thumb|Mugshot in 1976]]

On September 29, 1976 (Lewis's 41st birthday), Lewis fired a [[.357 Magnum]] at a Coke bottle in his bedroom. The bullet ricocheted and accidentally hit bassist Butch Owens in the chest. Owens survived.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Young |first=Charles M. |date=October 19, 2006 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: The Killer Reloaded |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jerry-lee-lewis-the-killer-reloaded-39491/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818111954/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jerry-lee-lewis-the-killer-reloaded-39491/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On November 23, 1976, Lewis was arrested outside [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[Graceland]] home for allegedly intending to shoot him.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Dan Epstein |first=Richard Bienstock |date=February 27, 2014 |title=30 Most Embarrassing Rock-Star Arrests |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/30-most-embarrassing-rock-star-arrests-22579/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818111948/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/30-most-embarrassing-rock-star-arrests-22579/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography, ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', Lewis said that the reclusive Presley had been trying to reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to "come out to the house." Lewis replied that he would if he had time, but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] for [[driving under the influence]]. Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.

Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but "Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The [[Memphis police]] found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs." Lewis said, "The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world. Presley himself died at Graceland nine months later.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tosches |first=Nick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |title=Country: The Twisted Roots Of Rock 'n' Roll |date=2009 |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=978-0-7867-5098-6 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173511/https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=November 4, 2014 |title=The Killer at Peace: Jerry Lee Lewis' Golden Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |page=3 |access-date=October 14, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818112008/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |website=The Smoking Gun |date=June 12, 2014 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915081623/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1980, an auction was held, but only 150 potential bidders showed up. The auction amassed $91,382, a third of the debt.<ref name=":0" />

In 1984, Lewis was found innocent of evading taxes, but he still owed the IRS money. The next year, the IRS seized property from his Nesbit, Mississippi ranch.<ref name=":0" />

In 1988, Lewis filed for bankruptcy, petitioning that he was more than $3&nbsp;million in debt, including $2&nbsp;million he owed to the IRS.<ref name=":0" />

'''James Frederick Rodgers''' (September 18, 1933 – January 18, 2021) was an American pop singer. Rodgers had a run of hits and mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. His string of crossover singles ranked highly on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]], [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]], and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm and Blues Sides]] charts; in the 1960s, Rodgers had more modest successes with [[adult contemporary music]].

He was not related to country music pioneer [[Jimmie Rodgers|Jimmie C. Rodgers]] (1897–1933), who died the same year the younger Rodgers was born. Among country audiences, and in his official songwriting credits, the younger Rodgers, Jimmie Frederick, was often credited as '''Jimmie F. Rodgers''' to differentiate the two.

==Career==
===Early years===
Rodgers was born in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref name="auto4">Wayne Harada. "Spotlighted Singer." ''Honolulu Advertiser'', September 15, 1957, p. 36.</ref>  He was the second son of Archie and Mary Rodgers.<ref name="auto2">John Vergara, "Oh, Oh, He's Done It Again." ''New York Daily News'', April 27, 1958, p. M4.</ref>  Rodgers was taught music by his mother, a piano teacher,<ref name="auto1">"Jimmie Rodgers Returns to the Stage." ''Reno (NV) Gazette'', February 24, 1983, p. 16.</ref> and began performing as a child, first entertaining at a Christmas show when he was only five.<ref name="auto4" /> He learned to play the piano and guitar, and performed locally.

After attending [[Camas High School]], he briefly took courses at Clark College in Vancouver, Washington.<ref name="auto2" /> He later went to work at the [[Crown Zellerbach]] paper mill in Camas.  Although he loved music, he was uncertain whether he could turn it into a career. He was subsequently drafted and served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.<ref name="auto">Dick Kleiner. "Honeycomb Started Here." ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 3, 1957, p. 7C.</ref>

=== 1950s ===
While in the Air Force, Rodgers joined a band named The Melodies started by violinist Phil Clark. During his service, he was transferred to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was stationed at Sewart Air Force Base from 1954 to 1956.<ref name="auto3">Robert K. Oermann. "Jimmie Rodgers: There's No Stopping Him Now." ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 27, 1985, p. D1.</ref> It was during this time that he began expanding his musical repertoire. While he was in Nashville, he first heard "[[Honeycomb (song)|Honeycomb]]", the song that became his first hit.<ref name="auto" />

Like a number of other entertainers of the era, he was one of the contestants on [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s talent show on CBS television, winning $700.<ref name="auto5">{{Cite web |title=Jimmie Rodgers on singing and surviving |url=https://www.thespectrum.com/story/entertainment/2016/05/26/jimmie-rodgers-singing-and-surviving/84813944/ |website=The Spectrum & Daily News}}</ref>  When [[Hugo Peretti]] and [[Luigi Creatore]] left [[RCA Records#Beginnings and history|RCA Victor]] for [[Morris Levy]]'s company, [[Roulette Records]], they became aware of Rodgers' talent and signed him to a recording contract.

In the summer of 1957, he recorded his version of "[[Honeycomb (song)|Honeycomb]]", written by [[Bob Merrill]] and recorded by [[Georgie Shaw]] three years earlier.<ref>Rod Ellis. "WDXN's Disc Digest." ''(Clarksville TN) Leaf-Chronicle'', September 6, 1957, p. 3.</ref>  The tune was Rodgers' biggest [[Hit song|hit]], staying on the top of the charts for four weeks. It sold over 1 million copies,<ref>"Honeycomb Passes Million." ''Cashbox'', October 5, 1957, p. 32.</ref> and was awarded a [[Music recording certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{Cite book |last=Murrells |first=Joseph |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |year=1978 |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |edition=2nd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 95] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Over the following year, he had a number of other hits that reached the top 10 on the charts: "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]"; "[[Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again]]"; "[[Secretly]]"; and "[[Are You Really Mine?]]". Other hits include "[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]]", "Bimbombey", "Ring-a-ling-a-lario", "Tucumcari", "Tender Love and Care (T.L.C)", and a version of ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' as a film [[tie-in]] with the apocalyptic movie ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' in 1959.

In the United Kingdom, "Honeycomb" reached number 30 pn the UK Singles Chart in November 1957, and "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]" climbed to number 7 the following month.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{Cite book |last=Roberts |first=David |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |year=2006 |isbn=1-904994-10-5 |edition=19th |location=London |page=467}}</ref> Both "Kisses Sweeter than Wine" and "Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again" were million sellers.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" />

The success of "Honeycomb" earned Rodgers guest appearances on numerous variety programs during 1957, including the "Shower of Stars" program, hosted by [[Jack Benny]], on October 31, 1957,<ref>Barbara Sammons. "Your TV Favorites on New Time Schedule Starting Today." ''Greenville (SC) News'', October 27, 1957, p. 28.</ref> and the Big Record with [[Patti Page]], on December 4, 1957.<ref>"Wednesday Television Programs." ''(New Brunswick NJ) Sunday Home News'', December 1, 1957, p. 13.</ref>  Rodgers also made several appearances on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'', including on September 8, 1957, when he was seen by 48,500,000, the largest television audience of his entire career,<ref>"TV News." ''(Salem OR) Capital Journal'', September 7, 1957, Section 2, p. 6.</ref> and November 3, 1957.<ref>"Famous Dancers From Bali Will Be on KOIN-TV." ''(Longview WA) Daily News'', November 2, 1957, p. 19.</ref>  In 1958, he appeared on NBC's ''[[The Gisele MacKenzie Show]]''. Also in 1958, he sang the opening theme song of the film ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]], [[Joanne Woodward]] and [[Orson Welles]].<ref>"Folk Song Rodgers to Do Title Number." ''Los Angeles Times'', December 27, 1957, part 3, p. 10.</ref> He then had his own short-lived televised variety show on NBC in 1959.<ref>William Ewald. "Television in Review." ''Naugatuck (CT) News'', May 27, 1959, p. 7.</ref>

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, Rodgers' [[Sloop John B|"Wreck of the John B"]] was a number 1 hit in Canada, and reached No. 64 on the U.S.charts. His biggest hit of the decade in the UK was "English Country Garden", a version of the folk song "[[Country Gardens]]", which reached number 5 in the chart in June 1962.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />  In 1962, he moved to the [[Dot Records|Dot]] label, and four years later to [[A&M Records]]. He also appeared in some films, including ''[[The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1961 film)|The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[Back Door to Hell]]'', which he helped finance.

In 1966, a long dry spell ended for Rodgers when he re-entered the Top 40 with "[[It's Over (Jimmie Rodgers song)|It's Over]]" (later to be recorded by [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Mason Williams]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], and [[Sonny James]]). In 1967, he changed record labels, signing with [[A&M Records]].<ref>Bill Rumfelt. "Easy Listening." ''Rocky Mount (NC) Telegram'', September 17, 1967, p. 2A.</ref> It was with that label that Rodgers had his final charting Top 100 single, "Child of Clay", written by [[Ernie Maresca]] (of "[[Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)]]" fame).<ref>David F. Wagner. "Under the Album Covers." ''Appleton (WI) Post-Crescent'', September 24, 1967, p. S10.</ref> He performed the song on several television variety shows, including ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'',<ref>"Channel Choices," ''Allentown (PA) Morning Call'', November 11, 1967, p. 10</ref> but it never became a big hit; it reached number 31 on the ''Billboard'' charts.

===Later career===
Recovery from injuries sustained mysteriously on a highway in 1967 caused an approximately year-long period in which Rodgers ceased to perform. Meanwhile, his voice was still being heard: Several of his earlier hits were used in jingles in the 1970s, one for [[SpaghettiOs]] and another for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb]] breakfast cereal.<ref name="auto3" /> And Rodgers' songs continued to make the ''Billboard'' Country and Easy Listening charts until 1979. During the summer of 1969, he made a brief return to network television with a summer variety show <ref>Paul Henniger. "TV People." ''San Francisco Examiner'', December 2, 1970, p. TV 19</ref> on ABC (which later bought the rights to Rodgers' [[Dot Records]] releases, now owned by [[Universal Music Group]]). It was not until the early 1980s when he began doing some limited live appearances again. Among the earliest was a series of shows in late February 1983: he performed at [[Harrah's Reno]] Casino Cabaret.<ref name="auto1" /> He also performed a few shows in other cities, including at a nightclub named Mister Days in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in late 1983.<ref>Tim Smith. "Jimmie Rodgers Rides Sweet Nostalgia Wave." ''Fort Lauderdale News/Sun-Sentinel'', May 27, 1983, p. 22.</ref>

Rodgers appeared in the 1999 video ''Rock & Roll Graffiti'' by American Public Television, along with about 20 other performers.<ref name="auto6">{{Cite news |title=Street signs point to Jimmie Rodgers Avenue |work=The Columbian |url=https://www.columbian.com/news/2013/sep/13/street-signs-point-to-jimmie-rodgers-avenue/}}</ref> Nevertheless, he gave "Honeycomb" a try, and he mentioned that he had a show in Branson, Missouri.

Rodgers returned to his hometown of Camas, Washington in 2011 and 2012, performing to sell-out crowds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 2013, his neighbors successfully got a street named after him, in the neighborhood where he grew up.<ref name="auto6" />

==Head injuries==
On December 1, 1967, Rodgers suffered traumatic head injuries after the car he was driving was stopped by an off-duty police officer near the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles. He had a fractured skull and required several surgeries.<ref name="sreimp">{{Cite news |date=December 11, 1967 |title=Singer reported improved after two brain operations |page=3A |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=Associated Press |location=(Oregon) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8OVVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4741%2C2607319}}</ref> Initial reports in the newspapers attributed his injuries to a severe beating with a blunt instrument by unknown assailants.<ref name="sgrhosp">{{Cite news |date=December 4, 1967 |title=Singer hospitalized |page=8 |work=Spartanburg Herald |agency=Associated Press |location=(South Carolina) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aX0sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vMwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6810%2C713954}}</ref><!--<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bWIwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3886,1691466&hl=en] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> --> Rodgers had no specific memory of how he had been injured, remembering only that he had seen blindingly bright lights from a car pulling up behind him.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BAAqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7361,530374&dq=jimmie+rodgers+bright+lights&hl=en |website=News.google.com |access-date=2016-09-20 |archive-date=2020-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309185307/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BAAqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7361,530374&dq=jimmie+rodgers+bright+lights&hl=en |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A few days later, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) stated that off-duty LAPD officer Michael Duffy (at times identified in the press as Richard Duffy) had stopped him for erratic driving, and that Rodgers had stumbled, fallen and hit his head. According to the police version, Duffy then called for assistance from two other officers, and the three of them put the unconscious Rodgers into his car and left the scene.<ref name="ppapltf">{{Cite news |date=December 20, 1967 |title=Jimmie Rodgers' injury linked to fall |page=11 |work=Pittsburgh Press |agency=UPI |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CsQbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pU8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7177%2C1546271}}</ref> That account was supported by the treating physicians, who had first blamed the skull fracture on a beating but, by the latter part of December, they concluded that Rodgers had in fact fallen and that had caused his injuries.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dmIwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=918,4276394&hl=en "New Disclosure Hints Rodgers Hurt By Fall," ''The Modesto Bee'', December 20, 1967, p.

== Lawsuits ==
The following month, Rodgers filed an $11 million lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles, claiming that the three officers had beaten him.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bronson |first=Fred |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits: Updated and Expanded 5th Edition |publisher=Billboard Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-823-07677-2 |location=New York |page=27}}</ref> The police and the L.A.

The three officers and the LA Fire and Police Protective League filed a $13 million slander suit against Rodgers for his public statements accusing them of brutality.<ref name="njrbsu">{{Cite news |last=Villasenor |first=Rudy |date=April 11, 1968 |title=Now Jimmie Rodgers being sued - for $13 million |page=5 |work=Tuscaloosa News |agency=(Los Angeles Times) |location=(Alabama) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=agAdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OZsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7089%2C2021890}}</ref>

Neither suit came to trial; the police slander suit was dropped, and in 1973 Rodgers elected to accept a $200,000 settlement from the Los Angeles City Council, which voted to give him the money rather than to incur the costs and risks of further court action.<ref name="fssetsu">{{Cite news |date=August 23, 1973 |title=Folk singer settles suit for $200,000 |page=15-A |work=St. Petersburg Times |agency=UPI |location=(Florida) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gepRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-HIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7055%2C1376958}}</ref> Rodgers and his supporters still believe that one or more of the police officers beat him, although other observers find the evidence inconclusive.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nashville Sound: Jimmie Rodgers |url=https://apnews.com/4c81ad015fac57cb988e8525ce047ad7 |website=Apnews.com}}</ref> In his 2010 biography ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', singer [[Tommy James]] wrote that [[Morris Levy]], the Mafia-connected head of Roulette Records, had arranged the attack in response to Rodgers' repeated demands for unpaid royalties he was due by the label. All of Rodgers' most successful singles had been released by Roulette, who were notorious for not paying their artists for their record sales.<ref>James, Tommy, ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', Scribner Publishing, 2010, p. 205</ref>

In 1993, Raymond Virgil Whisman, one of the three officers who were alleged to have assaulted Rodgers, was arrested for assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her.  The arrest occurred after sheriff's deputies stormed his house after being informed that he was holding his wife at gunpoint. Deputies found 11 rifles, four shotguns, and two handguns in the home.  Whisman was charged with two counts of assault and two counts of making terroristic threats.<ref>The Signal,Santa Clarita, California

== Publication ==
In 2010, Rodgers wrote and published his autobiography, ''Dancing on the Moon: The Jimmie Rodgers Story.''<ref name="auto5" /> 

== Personal life ==
Rodgers and his first wife Colleen (''née'' McClatchey) divorced in 1970, and she died May 20, 1977.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lodi News-Sentinel - Google News Archive Search |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19770520&id=QMMzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wjIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=4723,2163053 |website=News.google.com}}</ref>  They had two children, Michael and Michele. He had remarried in 1970, and Jimmie and Trudy Rodgers had two sons, Casey and Logan. He and Trudy divorced in the late 1970s, and he remarried again. Jimmie and Mary Rodgers were still married when he died, and they have a daughter, Katrine, who was born in 1989.

Rodgers suffered from [[spasmodic dysphonia]] for a number of years and could hardly sing. After a 2012 concert, he returned home for open heart surgery, following a heart attack he had suffered three weeks earlier. 

Rodgers died from kidney disease on January 18, 2021 at the age of 87.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Best Classic Bands Staff |date=19 January 2021 |title=Jimmie Rodgers, Early Rock 'n' Roll Star, Dies at 87 |work=Best Classic Bands |url=https://bestclassicbands.com/jimmie-rodgers-obituary-pop-singer-honeycomb-1-19-21 |access-date=2021-01-20}}</ref>

==Early life==
Hopkins was raised in [[Gainesville, Georgia]], the eldest of four brothers. He graduated from [[Florida State University]] 1993 with a degree in general theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johndriskellhopkins.com/press |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=John Driskell Hopkins |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>
During college at Florida State University, Hopkins was the front man of a band called The Woodpeckers.

==Career==
After college, Hopkins moved to Atlanta. In 1996, he formed his rock band Brighter Shade, with whom he still plays. Brighter Shade recorded two albums by the early 2000s. During that time, Hopkins got involved with the production end of the scene: producing, recording, and collaborating on several projects in the Atlanta area, including one with Zac Brown.
After several years of friendship with Brown, in 2005, Hopkins joined the Zac Brown Band on bass guitar and vocals.
In 2011, Hopkins joined forces with bluegrass band [[Balsam Range]].  In January 2013, they released their debut CD called ''Daylight'' to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zacbrownband.com/john-driskell-hopkins.html |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=Zac Brown Band |access-date=2014-06-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001053/http://www.zacbrownband.com/john-driskell-hopkins.html |archive-date=2014-05-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johndriskellhopkins.com |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=John Driskell Hopkins |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>

In 2019, Hopkins, along with fellow musicians Greg Lee, Mike Rizzi, Mark Dannells, and Mick Murphy, a formed heavy rock band, The Bloody Wolves of Venice.  The Bloody Wolves of Venice released a five-song EP, ''The Revelation EP'', which was featured in the 2018 film ''Adolescence''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-03-04 |title=John Driskell Hopkins' Heavy Revelation With The Bloody Wolves Of Venice |url=https://atlantamusicgrapevine.com/2019/03/04/john-driskell-hopkins-heavy-revelation-with-the-bloody-wolves-of-venice/ |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=Atlanta Music Grapevine |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Collaborations===
Hopkins heard Balsam Range on bluegrass radio in 2011 and was so impressed, he immediately bought all their music. They later met and made an immediate personal and musical connection. They decided to join forces and record a CD. In September 2012, the album ''Daylight'' was completed, and officially released January 2013.
{{blockquote|If you drew line graphs plotting the changes each song brings to a CD – tempo, subject, mood … – some CDs would flatline and the majority would show moderate spikes up and down. Daylight's graph would look like the EKG of a person on speed, and every song is a good one. I hope Hopkins is already planning his next CD.<ref>Larry Stephens, ''The lonesome Road Review''</ref>}}

Balsam Range is a five-piece bluegrass powerhouse from [[Haywood County, North Carolina]], and include members Buddy Melton (fiddle, vocals), Darren Nicholson (mandolin, vocals), Marc Pruett (banjo), Caleb Smith (guitar, vocals), and Tim Surrett (bass, dobro, vocals). Their accolades include being voted Best Old-Time/Bluegrass Band of 2012 in Asheville's Mountain Xpress and receiving the [[International Bluegrass Music Awards|IBMA]] Song of the Year award for "Trains I Missed 2011" and the 2013 IBMA "Album of the Year" award for ''Papertown'', and  the 2014 IBMA "Entertainer of the Year". Hopkins and Balsam Range continue to play shows together often.

Dobro master and 14-time Grammy winner [[Jerry Douglas]] was also featured on Hopkins' 2013 release, ''Daylight''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Daylight – John Driskell Hopkins |url=https://johndriskellhopkins.com/music/daylight/ |access-date=2022-05-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2014, Hopkins has also collaborated with Georgia native bluegrass group the "[[Dappled Grays]]" on several shows, including two sold-out nights at the [[Georgia Theater]] opening for [[The String Cheese Incident]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://balsamrange.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Balsam Range |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>

===Brighter Shade===
Hopkins formed aggressive songwriter band [[Brighter Shade]] in 1996. The original line-up consisted of Hopkins on vocals and guitar, Andy Birdsall on vocals and guitar, Sean McIntyre on bass, and Marcus Petruska on drums. They recorded their eponymous debut album in 1996.

Later, a second line-up followed, featuring Hopkins and Birsdall, but added Wilder Embry on bass, Damian Cartier on keyboards, and John Woodward and Eric Sanders on drums. They recorded Brighter Shade's sophomore album, ''Divine Ignorance'', in 2001. Brighter Shade still plays periodic gigs in and around the Atlanta area.

Hopkins' recording studio, Brighter Shade Studios, shares the name of his band, and was where the Zac Brown album ''Home Grown'' was recorded in 1998. Brighter Shade Studios was also used in the recording of first two major albums of the Zac Brown Band - ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'' and ''[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/brightershade |title=Brighter Shade &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/m/cd/brightershade/from/greatindiemusic |title=CD Baby Mobile |publisher=Cdbaby.com |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>

==Early life==
Fogerty was born in [[Berkeley, California]], and grew up in [[El Cerrito, California]], the third of five boys born to Galen Robert and Edith Lucile (Lytle) Fogerty. His father was born in [[Iowa]], and worked as a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator for the ''Berkeley Gazette'' in California. Lucile Fogerty taught second grade and was from [[Great Falls, Montana]]. John first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley, California. In his memoir, ''Fortunate Son'', Fogerty was critical of the school, saying when in class he was not permitted to go to the bathroom when he asked, and frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his wet clothing.<ref name="fortunate">{{Cite book|last=Fogerty|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/917202092|title=Fortunate son : my life, my music|date=2015|others=Jimmy McDonough|isbn=978-0-316-24457-2|location=New York|oclc=917202092}}</ref>

After one year, Fogerty enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School. In his book, he stated that his parents were [[alcoholic]]s and that they divorced when he was in the third or fourth grade.<ref name="fortunate"/> He later attended [[Saint Mary's College High School|St. Mary's High School]], then transferred to [[El Cerrito High School]], where he met the other future members of CCR and took guitar lessons from Berkeley Folk Festival creator/producer [[Barry Olivier]].<ref name="fortunate"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Hurd Anyaso|first=Hilary|title=Founder of Berkeley Folk Festival to Visit Northwestern|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2011/05/folk-festival-berkeley.html|website=Northwestern.edu|date=May 2011|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> Fogerty's older brother Tom was a guitarist and bandmate in the group that eventually became CCR. Fogerty spent summer vacations at [[Putah Creek]], near [[Winters, California]], which became the subject of the CCR song "[[Green River (song)|Green River]]".<ref name=Thompson>Thompson, Art.

While in junior high school in 1959, Fogerty formed a [[cover band]] with [[bassist]] Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford called the Blue Velvets. The band was inspired by [[rock and roll]] pioneers, especially [[Little Richard]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/levitin/fogerty.html |title=John Fogerty|website=Psych.mcgill.ca|access-date=2009-08-10|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715024129/http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/levitin/fogerty.html|archive-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> and [[Bo Diddley]]. Later, Fogerty's brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with [[Fantasy Records]], which, without the band's knowledge or approval, changed the band's name from the Blue Velvets to [[The Golliwogs]]. This group recorded seven singles that were not commercially successful.<ref name="hall-of-fame">{{cite web|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/creedence-clearwater-revival|website=rockhall.com|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=July 24, 2017|date=1993}}</ref>

[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival 1968.jpg|thumb|right|Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1968, from left to right: [[Tom Fogerty]], [[Doug Clifford]], [[Stu Cook]], and John Fogerty]]
After Fogerty's military service, the Golliwogs resumed playing, releasing an album in late 1967. In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|eponymous debut album]] and also had their first hit single, "[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with "[[Proud Mary]]" and the album ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]''.

Fogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band.<ref>{{cite journal|date=January 1998|title=Blue Moon Rising: The John Fogerty Interview (Cover Story)|journal=Audio Magazine}}</ref> These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit "[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]", and "[[Someday Never Comes]]", which made it into the ''Billboard'' Top 20.

Cook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept ''Mardi Gras'' as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, "My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs."{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} According to the two bandmates, Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or 
Fogerty would quit immediately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2022}} They accepted Fogerty's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status, though it generated weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly after the album was released.

The only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th El Cerrito high school class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion.

Even early in his career, “Fogerty's attitude toward music [was] serious, practiced, even perfectionistic. He drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal, insisting that his songs be performed his way. ...[He] was known for not indulging in drugs, and although John struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances.” <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sandefur |first1=Timothy |title=John Fogerty's Disciplined Focus |journal=The Objective Standard |volume=14 |issue= 4 |pages=84–85 |publisher=Glen Allen Press |date=Winter 2019 |url=https://theobjectivestandard.com/2019/08/john-fogertys-disciplined-focus/}}</ref> “Not in my band,” he writes in his memoir, ''Fortunate Son''. “You dare not be stoned playing music around me....

== Solo career ==
=== 1972–1985 ===
As CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of [[country and western]] [[Cover version|covers]], on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers—a band of which he was the only member.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=476}}</ref>

The eponymous ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'' was released in 1973; it spun off the [[top 20|top-20]] hit "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]", as well as a lesser hit in "Hearts of Stone".<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty, still using "The Blue Ridge Rangers" name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single: "You Don't Owe Me" b/w "Back in the Hills" (Fantasy F-710). It was a commercial flop, failing to make the US [[Billboard Hot 100]], though "You Don't Owe Me" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 79. Fogerty thereafter abandoned the "Blue Ridge Rangers" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name.<ref name="Larkin"/> In early 1974, Fogerty released "Comin' Down The Road"&mdash;backed with the instrumental "Ricochet".

His first official solo album, ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]'', was released in 1975.<ref name="Larkin"/> Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded "[[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|Rockin' All Over the World]]", a No. 27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, the British rock band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] recorded their version of "Rockin' All Over the World", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous.<ref name="Larkin"/> Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert.

In 1976, Fogerty finished an album called ''[[Hoodoo (John Fogerty album)|Hoodoo]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> A single, "You Got the Magic" backed with "Evil Thing", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by [[Asylum Records]] a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for ''Hoodoo'' sometime in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/hoodoo_john_fogertys_lost_occult_tinged_disco_rock_album |title= 'Hoodoo', John Fogerty's Lost, Occult-Tinged Disco Album |website= Dangerous Minds |date= May 20, 2016 |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref>

===1985–1997===
{{See also|The Old Man Down the Road|Fogerty v. Fantasy}}
After a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', his first album for [[Warner Bros. Records]], which had taken co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty.<ref name="Larkin"/> ''Centerfield'' went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in "[[The Old Man Down the Road]]".<ref name="Larkin"/> The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty.

Two songs on the album, "Zanz Kant Danz" and "Mr. Greed", were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at [[Fantasy Records]], [[Saul Zaentz]].<ref name="Larkin"/> "Zanz Kant Danz" was about a pig that cannot dance, but would "steal your money". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: "Vanz Kant Danz" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (''Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty'') claimed that "The Old Man Down the Road" shared the same chorus as "[[Run Through the Jungle]]", a song from Fogerty's days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights.<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions and also that sounding like himself was not plagiarizing. Fogerty then [[counterclaim|countersued]] for attorney fees (''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]''). After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs.<ref name="Larkin"/>

On May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called ''John Fogerty's All-Stars''. The setlist consisted of [[rhythm and blues]] tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the ''Centerfield'' LP and the song "No Love in You" written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the [[Textones]]' debut album ''Midnight Mission'' and he later recorded with Textones' band leader Carla Olson. ''John Fogerty's All-Stars'' was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&M Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included [[Albert Lee]], [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Duck Dunn]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], and [[Prairie Prince]].

The follow-up album to ''Centerfield'' was ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]'' in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor.<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. ''Eye of the Zombie'' took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the ''Eye of the Zombie'' tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, "Change in the Weather" was included in the setlist for his 2009 tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year's solo release, ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.

Fogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, D.C., for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on [[HBO]]. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at [[Oakland Coliseum]] for the Concert Against AIDS. His backing band that night consisted of [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] on guitars, [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, and [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maniacpaul.thejakubowskis.com/details.php?b_id=112v|title=John Fogerty – In Concert Against AIDS |year=2004 |publisher=thejakubowskis.com|access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 1990, his brother Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, survived by his second wife and six children. Tom contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. Specifically, he died from a tuberculosis infection. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were barely speaking to each other.<ref>VH1 Legends: John Fogerty—''Viacom International, VH1, 1996''</ref> In fact, even in the brothers' very last conversation with each other, Tom at one point referred to Creedence Clearwater Revival's former manager Saul Zaentz as his "best friend".<ref name= "Autobiography"/> Given that Zaentz had swindled the band out of millions of dollars and had just recently attempted to sue John, this revelation made it painfully difficult for John to reconcile with Tom. In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: "We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview|title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules.

Fogerty traveled to [[Mississippi]] in 1990 for inspiration, and visited the gravesite of blues legend [[Robert Johnson]]. According to him, while there, he had the realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, thus Fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old CCR material regularly in concert.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1518067/john-fogerty-embraces-his-past.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510095507/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1518067/john-fogerty-embraces-his-past.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2008|title=John Fogerty Embraces His Past|last=Gilbert|first=Calvin|date=December 13, 2005|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] News|access-date=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/ENT0501/807310303/1052/ENT|title=John Fogerty's epiphany at a bluesman's plot|last=Spevak|first=Jeff|date=July 31, 2008|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|access-date=2008-08-02|archive-date=December 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220064118/http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/ENT0501/807310303/1052/ENT|url-status=dead}}</ref> At this time, visiting the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church cemetery, Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation, the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]], to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty subsequently funded headstones for [[Charlie Patton]], [[James Thomas (blues musician)|James “Son” Thomas]], [[Mississippi Joe Callicott]], Eugene Powell, and [[Lonnie Pitchford]], and helped with financial arrangements for numerous others.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9901E0D9163CF933A0575AC0A961958260.html |title=Homage at Last for Blues Makers; Through a Fan's Crusade, Unmarked Graves Get Memorials |last=Yellin|first=Emily|date=September 30, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2008-06-10}}</ref>

Creedence Clearwater Revival was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony, citing the Zaentz lawsuit as a reason. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]] in performing three songs: "[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]", "[[Born on the Bayou]]", and "[[Green River (song)|Green River]]".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sweeting|first1=Adam|title=The saddest story in rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3|access-date=March 30, 2015|work=theguardian.com|date=July 11, 2000}}</ref> The other two surviving members were believed to have laughed it off in disappointment. During the induction speech, Springsteen said, "As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty]. He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. Funny, too. He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and he got out of there."<ref>Barker, Derek (2009). Liner notes to ''Bruce Springsteen's Jukebox: The Songs that Inspired the Man'' [CD].

[[File:John Forgerty in 2000.jpg|thumb|Fogerty in Washington, D.C., in 1998]]

Fogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 with ''[[Blue Moon Swamp]]''. The layoff between ''Zombie'' and ''Swamp'' had been longer than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful than ''Zombie'' and won the [[Grammy]] for best rock album in 1997. A live album, named ''[[Premonition (John Fogerty album)|Premonition]]'', of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour, was released to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998. A track from ''Blue Moon Swamp'' titled "Blue Moon Nights," was used in the 2002 film ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''.

On October 1, 1998, Fogerty was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 7000 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Calendar/CalendarPast2.shtml#walk |title=Recent Hollywood Events |website=Seeing-stars.com |access-date=2010-03-30}}</ref>

In 2004, Fogerty released ''[[Deja Vu All Over Again (album)|Deja Vu All Over Again]]'' through [[DreamWorks Records]], which had taken over distribution of Fogerty's Warner catalog. ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: "The title track is Fogerty's indictment of the [[Iraq War]] as another [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], a senseless squandering of American lives and power". On the album, Fogerty squeezed ten songs into only 34 minutes.

The sale of Fantasy Records to [[Concord Records]] in 2004 ended the 30-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label, as the new owners took steps to restore [[royalties|royalty]] rights Fogerty had given up to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid-1970s. In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records, made possible when DreamWorks Records' noncountry-music unit was absorbed by [[Geffen Records]], which dropped Fogerty, but continued to distribute his earlier solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was ''[[The Long Road Home (album)|The Long Road Home]]'' (November 2005), a compilation CD combining his CCR hits with solo material. A live CD and concert [[The Long Road Home - In Concert|DVD]] were released the following year.

Fogerty's touring schedule increased in the period after ''Deja Vu All Over Again''. In October 2004, Fogerty appeared on the [[Vote for Change]] tour, playing seven of the concerts in U.S. [[swing states]]. He also appeared in a Christmas special video produced by the Australian children's group [[The Wiggles]]. <!-- "Centerfield" was also played at the 2008 Republican National Convention when John McCain introduced Sarah Palin as his running mate. Fogerty's numbers were played with [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]].--> Fogerty toured with [[John Mellencamp]] in the summer of 2005 and with [[Willie Nelson]] in the summer of 2006. On June 29, 2006, he played his first headlining British concert since 1972, at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] theater in London, as part of the European leg of the tour. During that leg, he also performed in Sundsvall, Sweden, where 25,000 people came to see him perform at the town square. On Thanksgiving Day of 2006, Fogerty performed at halftime at the [[Miami Dolphins]]/[[Detroit Lions]] game and at the [[Denver Broncos]]/[[Kansas City Chiefs]] halftime later that evening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/thanksgiving |title=''NFL.com'', 20 November 2006 |website=Nfl.com |date=November 23, 2009 |access-date=2010-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403094240/http://www.nfl.com/thanksgiving |archive-date=April 3, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregamehalftime.com/ |title=Website for the Kansas City/Denver Thanksgiving game halftime promoters |website=Pregamehalftime.com |date=September 13, 2009 |access-date=2010-03-30}}</ref><ref>[http://kcchiefs.com/news/2006/11/13/broncos_vs_chiefs__1123__volunteers_needed Thanksgiving game – Volunteers needed!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181654/http://kcchiefs.com/news/2006/11/13/broncos_vs_chiefs__1123__volunteers_needed |date=September 30, 2007 }} ''KCChiefs.com'', November 13, 2006.</ref>

Fogerty was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2005.

In 2005, Fogerty received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] presented by Awards Council member [[B.B.

On February 10, 2008, Fogerty appeared with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]] on the [[Grammy Awards]] show. Along with these rock icons and his regular touring band, he played his 1973 single "Comin' Down The Road", leading into Lewis and Richard's performances of "Great Balls of Fire" and "Good Golly Miss Molly", respectively.

On March 16, 2008, Fogerty kicked off an Australian tour.

After meeting with the then-[[laird]] of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] in [[Fife]], Major Michael Crichton-Stuart, Cash became interested in his Scots ancestry. He traced his Scottish surname to 11th-century Fife. {{Sfn|Miller|2003|p=11}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dalton |first=Stephanie |date=January 15, 2006 |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/people.cfm?id=66542006 |title=Walking the line back in time |newspaper=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |access-date=June 28, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021235805/http://heritage.scotsman.com/people.cfm?id=66542006 |archive-date=October 21, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page= 3 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0-06-072753-5 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the surname of his father.{{Sfn|Miller|2003|p=11}} He is a distant cousin of British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Bill Cash|Sir William Cash]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/me-and-my-cousin-johnny-by-william-cash-q8gvzxml5|title=Me and my cousin Johnny, by William Cash|first=William|last=Cash|date=October 24, 2019|website=Thetimes.co.uk}}</ref> He also had English ancestry.

In March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in [[Dyess, Arkansas]], a [[New Deal]] colony established during the [[Great Depression]] under the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. It was intended to give poor families the opportunity to work land that they might later own.<ref name=Bowden>{{cite news|last1=Bowden|first1=Bill|title=National Register accepts Johnny Cash boyhood home in Arkansas|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|access-date=May 7, 2018|work=ArkansasOnline|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505231153/http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|archive-date=May 5, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> 

From the age of five, Cash worked in cotton fields with his family, singing with them as they worked. Dyess and the Cash farm suffered a flood during his childhood. Later he wrote the song "[[Five Feet High and Rising (song)|Five Feet High and Rising]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=20  |url=https://books.google.com/books |isbn=0-06-072753-5 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression gave him a lifelong sympathy for the poor and working class, and inspired many of his songs.

Cash often spoke of the guilt he felt over the incident. He would say that he looked forward to "meeting [his] brother in Heaven".<ref name="Streissguth_profile" />

Cash's early memories were dominated by [[gospel music]] and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a [[tenor|high-tenor]] voice, before becoming a [[baritone|bass-baritone]] after his [[voice change]]d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gross |first1=Terry |title=All I Did Was Ask: Conversations with Writers, Actors Musicians, and Artists |date=2004 |publisher=[[Hachette Books]] |page=31 |edition=Hardcover}}</ref> 

In high school, he sang on a local Arkansas radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs called ''[[My Mother's Hymn Book]]''. He was also strongly influenced by traditional [[Music of Ireland|Irish music]], which he heard performed weekly by [[Dennis Day]] on the [[Jack Benny]] radio program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Johnny Cash: The 'Fresh Air' Interview |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=503138966 |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=February 27, 2019 |date=November 24, 2016 |quote=And I'd sing Dennis Day songs like. ...Yeah, songs that he sang on the Jack Benny show.

Cash enlisted in the Air Force on July 7, 1950, shortly after the start of the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|first=William|last=Abbott|url=http://www.southernmusic.net/johnnycash.html|title=Johnny Cash&nbsp;– February 26, 1932&nbsp;– September 12, 2003|website=Southernmusic.net|access-date=December 31, 2011}}</ref> After [[basic training]] at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] and technical training at [[Brooks Air Force Base]], both in [[San Antonio, Texas]], Cash was assigned to the 12th Radio Squadron Mobile of the [[U.S. Air Force Security Service]] at [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]], [[West Germany]]. While in San Antonio, he met [[Vivian Cash|Vivian Liberto]], an attractive girl of Sicilian, Irish and German ancestry. They dated briefly before his departure. During the years he served overseas, they exchanged thousands of letters.

He worked in West Germany as a [[Morse code]] operator, intercepting [[Soviet Army]] transmissions.

=== Early career ===
[[File:Johnny Cash Promotional Photo 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Publicity photo for Sun Records, 1955]]
In 1954, Cash and his first wife Vivian moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to "go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell". In a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|newspaper=NPR|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, "[[Hey Porter]]" and "[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.

Cash's next record, "Folsom Prison Blues", made the country top five. His "[[I Walk the Line]]" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. "[[Home of the Blues]]" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Cash felt that Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.

In 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single "[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]" became one of his biggest hits. He recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind such a backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.{{Efn|When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it had also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.}}

Early in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname "the Undertaker" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|title=10 Things you didn't know about Johnny Cash|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=October 31, 2013|archive-date=October 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016134501/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], June, and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]''. It was later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.

Cash's career was handled by [[Saul Holiff]], a [[London, Ontario]], promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com|title=My Father and The Man in Black|website=Johnny-and-saul.com|access-date=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517093414/http://johnny-and-saul.com/|archive-date=May 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his "nervousness" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].

Although he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by [[June Carter]]'s sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash.<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles|10|3}}</ref> He said that it had come to him in a dream. 

His first wife Vivian (Liberto) Cash claimed a different version of the origins of "Ring of Fire". In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'' (2007), Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Vivian |last2=Sharpsteen |first2=Ann |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1416532927 |page=294 |edition=Hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmkBUE0f3HAC&pg=PA294 |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>

In June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California.

Although Cash cultivated a romantic [[outlaw]] image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he was held only one night each time. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this incident as the basis for the song "Starkville City Jail". He discussed this on his live ''At San Quentin'' album.)<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[At San Quentin]]'', [[Columbia Records]] CS 9827, 1969</ref> 

While on tour later that year, he was arrested October 4 in [[El Paso, Texas]], by a [[narcotic]]s squad. The officers suspected he was [[smuggling]] [[heroin]] from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules (amphetamines) and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, Cash received a [[suspended sentence]]. He posted a $1,500 bond and was released until his arraignment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219065356/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 19, 2013|title=Johnny Cash's dark California days|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=October 12, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

In this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s. His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. 

In 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.

Reaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash and his first wife divorced after having separated in 1962. Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]", won a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22johnny+cash%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All/|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

Cash was last arrested in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills when in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> 

Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: "I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me."<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref> June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in [[Franklin, Kentucky]]. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had "cleaned up."<ref>{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone: The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music|url=https://archive.org/details/willyoumissmewhe0000zwon|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-85763-3}}</ref>

Cash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an "[[altar call]]" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend [[Hank Snow]]. According to [[Marshall Grant]], though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968; and did not fully end drug use for another two years. He was drug-free for a period of seven years. In his memoir about time with Cash, Grant said that the birth of Cash's son, [[John Carter Cash]], inspired the singer to end his dependence.<ref name="Grant page 92">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92 92, 177]|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92}}</ref>

Cash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was deeply addicted again. He entered rehab at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]] for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. 

In 1989, he entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he started care at the Loma Linda Behavioral Medicine Center in [[Loma Linda, California]], for his final rehabilitation treatment. (Several months later, his son followed him into this facility for treatment.)<ref name=Grant>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars}}</ref><ref name="John Carter Cash">{{cite book|last=Cash|first=John Carter|title=Anchored in Love|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8499-0187-4}}</ref>

=== Folsom and other prison concerts ===
In the late 1950s Cash began performing concerts at prisons. He played his first notable prison concert on January 1, 1958, at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in California.<ref name="cash1958">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/inmate-merle-haggard-hears-johnny-cash-play-san-quentin-state-prison "Inmate Merle Haggard hears Johnny Cash play San Quentin State Prison"], history.com; accessed June 24, 2014.</ref> These performances were recorded live, and released on highly successful albums: ''[[At Folsom Prison|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison]]'' (1968) and ''[[At San Quentin|Johnny Cash at San Quentin]]'' (1969). Both live albums reached number one on ''Billboard'' country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the ''Billboard'' pop album chart. In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even [[The Beatles]] by selling 6.5&nbsp;million albums.<ref>Edwards, Leigh H. "Cash, Johnny." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as ''Strawberry Cake'' recorded in London and ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.

The [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his "Folsom Prison Blues", while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single "[[A Boy Named Sue]]", a [[Shel Silverstein]] novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. [[Top 40|top-10]] pop charts.

In 1972 Cash performed at the [[Österåker Prison]] in Sweden. The live album ''[[På Österåker]]'' (''At Österåker'') was released in 1973. "San Quentin" was recorded with Cash replacing "San Quentin" with "Österåker". In 1976, a concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]] was videotaped for TV broadcast. It was posthumously released after Cash's death as a CD entitled ''[[A Concert Behind Prison Walls]]''.

=== Activism for Native Americans ===
Cash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Johnny Cash and the paradox of American Identity|last=Edwards|first=Leigh|publisher=Bloomington : Indiana University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-253-35292-7}}</ref> Cash sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S. government.

{{blockquote|In '57, I wrote a song called "Old Apache Squaw" and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.<ref>{{cite episode |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny| title=Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash |series=[[Rainbow Quest]] |season=1 |number=39 |year=1966}}</ref>}}

Columbia Music, the label for which Cash was recording then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it "too radical for the public".<ref>Cash, J., & Carr, P. (1997). ''Cash: The autobiography'' (p. 408). San Francisco, CA: HarperSanFrancisco.</ref> Cash singing songs of Indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country music in the 1950s, which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy who makes the native's soil his own.<ref>Tahmahkera, D. (2011). Volume 63. In ''American Quarterly'' (p. 597). Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

In 1964, coming off the chart success of his previous album ''[[I Walk the Line (1964 album)|I Walk the Line]]'', he recorded the aforementioned album ''[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian]]''.

The album featured stories of a multitude of Indigenous peoples, emphasizing their violent oppression by white settlers: the [[Pima people]] ("The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]"), [[Navajo]] ("Navajo"), [[Apache]] ("Apache Tears"), [[Lakota people|Lakota]] ("Big Foot"), [[Seneca people|Seneca]] ("As Long as the Grass Shall Grow"), and [[Cherokee]] ("The Talking Leaves"). Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one with the help of [[Johnny Horton]]. 

The majority of these protest songs were written by folk artist [[Peter La Farge]] (son of [[Oliver La Farge]], an activist and Pulitzer prizewinner.) Cash met the younger La Farge in New York in the 1960s and admired him for his activism.<ref>{{cite web|date=1965|title=Johnny Cash and June Carter (Television series episode). In Rainbow Quest.

([[Ira Hayes]] was a Native American who was one of the six soldiers featured in a photo raising the U.S. flag at [[Iwo Jima]] during World War II.)

The record label denied it promotion due to what it considered a provocative and "unappealing" nature. Cash faced resistance and was urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the [[Country Music Association]], who said: "You and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks, country artists, and country DJs."<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2009/11/09/johnny_cash_2/|title=The bitter tears of Johnny Cash|date=November 9, 2009|website=Salon.com|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>

In reaction, on August 22, 1964, Cash posted a letter as an advertisement in [[Billboard Magazine|''Billboard'']], calling the record industry cowardly: "D.J.s – station managers – owners{{nbsp}}[...] where are your guts? I had to fight back when I realized that so many stations are afraid of Ira Hayes. Just one question: WHY???

[[File:JohnnyCashHouse1969.jpg|thumb|right|Cash in 1969]]

Later, on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', he continued telling stories of Native-American plight, both in song and through short films, such as the history of the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1970|title=[Television series episode].

In 1966, in response to his activism, Cash was adopted by the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] Nation's Turtle Clan.<ref name=senecaadopted>[https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s960x960/84588691_2675377689224578_3648699607011033088_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=TLq_Vb72ulYAX_Aud0G&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=349f5d9cc6e83e4ae11978728a19d504&oe=5ED2CBF5 Singer Johnny Cash adopted by Senecas]{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===''The Johnny Cash Show''===
From June 1969 to March 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/08/10/johnny-cashs-excellent-music-variety-tv-show-ran-58-episodes-but-was-canceled-in-a-rural-purge/|title=Johnny Cash's excellent music variety TV show ran 58 episodes but was canceled in a "rural purge"|date=August 10, 2017|work=The Vintage News|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Produced by [[Screen Gems]], the show was performed at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville. [[The Statler Brothers]] opened for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend Carl Perkins were also part of the regular show entourage. Cash also enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including [[Linda Ronstadt]] in her first TV appearance, [[Neil Young]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition]] (who appeared four times), [[James Taylor]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=":0" />

From September 15–18, 1969, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], he performed a series of four concerts at the [[New Mexico State Fair]] to promote the first season of ''The Johnny Cash Show''.<ref name="Johnny Cash Infocenter Albuquerque">{{cite web | title=Johnny Cash Live Performances | website=Johnny Cash Infocenter | date=September 11, 1956 | url=http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/concerts.php?search=Albuquerque&col=date&sort=ASC&filter1=&filter2=&submit=+Search+&x= | access-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-date=February 24, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224145334/http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/concerts.php?search=Albuquerque&col=date&sort=ASC&filter1=&filter2=&submit=+Search+&x= | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="JC Infocenter 1969">{{cite web | title=Details | website=Johnny Cash Infocenter | date=September 15, 1969 | url=http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/details.php?show=1969-09-15 | access-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-date=February 25, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225042925/http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/details.php?show=1969-09-15 | url-status=dead }}</ref> These live shows were produced with help from ABC and local concert producer Bennie Sanchez; during these sets, Johnny Cash and [[Al Hurricane]] performed together.<ref name="Jojola 2011">{{cite web | last=Jojola | first=Lloyd | title=ABQJOURNAL PROFILES: Sanchez: Matriarch to Musicians | website=Albuquerque Journal | date=January 31, 2011 | url=https://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/3192721214obitsprofiles01-31-11.htm | access-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205221219/https://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/3192721214obitsprofiles01-31-11.htm | url-status=dead }}</ref> Also during ''The Johnny Cash Show'' era, he contributed the title song and other songs to the film ''Little Fauss and Big Halsy'', which starred [[Robert Redford]], [[Michael J.

Cash had first met with Dylan in the mid-1960s and became neighbors in the late 1960s in [[Woodstock, New York]]. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan, "[[Girl from the North Country]]", on Dylan's country album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' and also wrote the album's [[Grammy]]-winning [[liner notes]].

Another artist who received a major career boost from ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was [[Kris Kristofferson]], who was beginning to make a name for himself as a singer-songwriter. During a live performance of Kristofferson's "[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]", Cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] intact:

The closing program of ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was a gospel music special. Guests included the [[The Blackwood Brothers|Blackwood Brothers]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Stuart Hamblen]], and [[Billy Graham]].<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash'', Relevant Books, 2003, p. 91.</ref>

=== The "Man in Black" ===
[[File:President Richard Nixon and Johnny Cash.jpg|thumb|Cash advocated [[prison reform]] at his July 1972 meeting with President [[Richard Nixon]]]]

By the early 1970s, Cash had established his public image as the "Man in Black". He regularly performed in entirely black suits with a long, black, knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the [[rhinestone]] suits and [[cowboy boots]] worn by most of the major country acts of his day.

[[File:Johnny-Cash 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Cash performing in [[Bremen]], West Germany, in September 1972]]
Cash said he wore all black on behalf of the poor and hungry, the "prisoner who has long paid for his crime", and those who have been betrayed by age or drugs.<ref name="85-86">{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |pages= 85–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> He added, "With the [[Vietnam War]] as painful in my mind as it was in most other Americans, I wore it 'in mourning' for the lives that could have been'&nbsp;... Apart from the Vietnam War being over, I don't see much reason to change my position&nbsp;... The old are still neglected, the poor are still poor, the young are still dying before their time, and we're not making many moves to make things right. There's still plenty of darkness to carry off."<ref name="85-86"/>

[[File:One piece at a time.jpg|thumb|right|Cash in the "one piece at a time" Cadillac]]
Initially, he and his band had worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color.<ref name="Page 64"/> The outdated [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|US Navy's winter blue uniform]] used to be referred to by sailors as "Johnny Cashes", as the uniform's shirt, tie, and trousers are solid black.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.navytimes.com/legacy/new/0-NAVYPAPER-356961.php|title=The good, bad and ugly of proposed uniforms|newspaper=[[Navy Times]]|date=October 4, 2004}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Cash's popularity and number of hit songs began to decline. He made commercials for [[Amoco]] and [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]], an unpopular enterprise at the time of the [[1970s energy crisis]]. In 1976, he made commercials for [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel Trains]], for which he also wrote the music.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lionel Trains: A Pictorial History of Trains and Their Collectors|page=19|author=Turner Publishing|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|year=2004|isbn=978-1-56311-958-3}}</ref> However, his first autobiography, ''Man in Black'', was published in 1975 and sold 1.3&nbsp;million copies. A second, ''Cash: The Autobiography'', appeared in 1997.

Cash's friendship with [[Billy Graham]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Allmond, Joy|date=September 13, 2015|title=Johnny Cash's Faith and Friendship with Billy Graham|publisher=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|url=https://billygraham.org/story/johnny-cashs-faith-and-friendship-with-billy-graham/}}</ref> led to his production of a film about the life of Jesus, ''[[Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus]]'', which Cash co-wrote and narrated. It was released in 1973. Cash viewed the film as a statement of his personal faith rather than a means of proselytizing.<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash.'' Relevant Books, 2003, p. 117.</ref>

Cash and June Carter Cash appeared several times on the ''Billy Graham Crusade'' TV specials, and Cash continued to include gospel and religious songs on many of his albums, though Columbia declined to release ''[[A Believer Sings the Truth]]'', a gospel double-LP Cash recorded in 1979 and which ended up being released on an independent label even with Cash still under contract to Columbia. On November 22, 1974, CBS ran his one-hour TV special entitled'' Riding The Rails'', a musical history of trains.

He continued to appear on television, hosting Christmas specials on [[CBS]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Later television appearances included a starring role in an episode of ''[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 3|Columbo]]'', entitled "Swan Song". June and he appeared in an episode of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', entitled "The Collection". He gave a performance as abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in the 1985 [[American Civil War]] television miniseries ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]''. In the 1990s, Johnny and June appeared in ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' in recurring roles.

He was friendly with every US president, starting with [[Richard Nixon]]. He was closest to [[Jimmy Carter]], with whom he became close friends and who was a distant cousin of his wife, June.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

Cash declined to play the first two and instead selected other songs, including "The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]" and his own compositions, "[[What Is Truth]]" and "Man in Black". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=304 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn= 9780062515001 |edition=hardcover| access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed "antihippie and antiblack" sentiments might have backfired.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page= 212 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> In his remarks when introducing Cash, Nixon joked that one thing he had learned about him was one did not tell him what to sing.<ref>[[Richard Nixon]], April 17, 1970, released on Johnny Cash, ''Bootleg Vol. III: Live Around the World'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]]/Legacy 88697 93033 2), released 2011</ref>

=== Highwaymen and departure from Columbia Records ===
[[File:Highwaymen.jpg|thumb|[[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] members [[Kris Kristofferson]], Johnny Cash, [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]]]]
In 1980, Cash became the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]'s youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s, his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;– The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.

During that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County (film)|Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life [[Murder in Coweta County|Georgia murder]] case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis.

Cash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an [[ostrich]] on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005}}</ref>

At a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a "[[near-death experience]]".

{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}
In 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled "[[The Chicken in Black]]" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash – who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as "A Boy Named Sue" and "One Piece at a Time" – accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked "like a buffoon" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores—interrupting its bona fide chart success—and termed the venture "a fiasco".<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 500–502</ref>

Between 1981 and 1984, he recorded several sessions with famed [[countrypolitan]] producer [[Billy Sherrill]] (who also produced "The Chicken in Black"), which were shelved; they would be released by Columbia's sister label, [[Legacy Recordings]], in 2014 as ''[[Out Among the Stars]]''.<ref name="ats">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-lost-album-out-among-the-stars-20131210,0,2223681.story|title='Lost' Early-'80s Johnny Cash Album Slated for March 25 Release|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=December 10, 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Around this time, Cash also recorded [[Believe in Him|an album of gospel recordings]] that ended up being released by another label around the time of his departure from Columbia (this due to Columbia closing down its Priority Records division that was to have released the recordings).

After more unsuccessful recordings were released between 1984 and 1985, Cash left Columbia.

In 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with [[Roy Orbison]], Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''; according to Hilburn, Columbia still had Cash under contract at the time, so special arrangements had to be made to allow him to participate.<ref>Hilburn, p. 506</ref> Also in 1986, Cash published his only novel, ''Man in White'', a book about [[Paul the Apostle|Saul]] and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. He recorded ''Johnny Cash Reads The Complete [[New Testament]]'' in 1990.

=== ''American Recordings'' ===
[[File:Johnny Cash sings a duet with a Navy lieutenant.jpg|thumb|Johnny Cash sings with a Navy lieutenant during a military event {{circa}} January 1987]]
After Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with [[Mercury Records]] from 1987 to 1991. During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.

Though Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death, his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a "morale booster"; Rosanne Cash later said "he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it". The album attracted press attention on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/28/johnny-cash-indie-1980s-resurrection |title=The Resurrection of Johnny Cash |last=Thomson |first=Graeme |date=April 28, 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> In 1991, he sang a version of "Man in Black" for the [[Christian punk]] band [[One Bad Pig]]'s album ''I Scream Sunday''. In 1993, he sang "[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]", the closing track of [[U2]]'s album ''[[Zooropa]]''. According to ''Rolling Stone'' writer Adam Gold, "The Wanderer" – written for Cash by Bono, "defies both the U2 and Cash canons, combining rhythmic and textural elements of Nineties synth-pop with a Countrypolitan lament fit for the closing credits of a Seventies western."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Gold |first1=Adam |title=How U2 Fell in Love with Nashville and Influenced Today's Country Music |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-u2s-love-affair-with-nashville-country-music-w491992 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 26, 2019 |date=July 13, 2017 |archive-date=December 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209095057/http://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-u2s-love-affair-with-nashville-country-music-w491992 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

No longer sought-after by major labels, he was offered a contract with producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] label, which had recently been rebranded from Def American, under which name it was better known for rap and [[hard rock]]. Under Rubin's supervision, he recorded ''[[American Recordings (album)|American Recordings]]'' (1994) in his living room, accompanied only by his [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] Dreadnought guitar&nbsp;– one of many Cash played throughout his career.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/the-guitars-of.html |website=Fretbase.com |title=The Guitars of Johnny Cash |date=August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001225814/http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/the-guitars-of.html |archive-date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> The album featured covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin. The album had a great deal of critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 [[Glastonbury Festival]] was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and commercial success. He teamed up with [[Brooks & Dunn]] to contribute "Folsom Prison Blues" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. On the same album, he performed Bob Dylan's  "[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Cash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the television series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. He also lent his voice for a [[cameo role]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)]]", as the "Space Coyote" that guides [[Homer Simpson]] on a spiritual quest.

Cash was joined by guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] of [[Soundgarden]], bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] of [[Alice in Chains]] for a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Red Headed Stranger|Time of the Preacher]]", featured on the tribute album ''Twisted Willie'', released in January 1996.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-01-27-ca-29172-story.html |title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP : 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=January 27, 1996 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 1996, Cash collaborated with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] on ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'' (also known as ''American Recordings II''), which won the [[Best Country Album]] Grammy in 1998. The album was produced by Rick Rubin with [[Sylvia Massy]] engineering and mixing. A majority of ''Unchained'' was recorded at [[Sound City Studios]] and featured guest appearances by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], and [[Marty Stuart]]. Believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography ''Man in Black'', he wrote ''Cash: The Autobiography'' in 1997.

In 1997, during a trip to New York City, Cash was diagnosed with the [[neurodegenerative]] disease [[Multiple system atrophy|Shy–Drager syndrome]], a form of [[multiple system atrophy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Cash: The Autobiography |url=https://archive.org/details/cashautobiograph00cash |url-access=registration |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |date=1998 |orig-year=1997  |isbn=0061013579 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cashautobiograph00cash/page/400 400–403] |author-link=Johnny Cash}}</ref> According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]], and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson's after nearly collapsing on stage in [[Flint, Michigan]], on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 568–570</ref> The diagnosis was later again altered to [[Dysautonomia|autonomic neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]]. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe [[pneumonia]], which damaged his lungs.

During the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'' (2000) and ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' (2002). ''American IV'' included [[Cover version|cover songs]] by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably "[[Hurt (Johnny Cash song)|Hurt]]" by [[Nine Inch Nails]] and "[[Personal Jesus]]" by [[Depeche Mode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/|title=Johnny Cash, ''American IV: The Man Comes Around''|last=Carr|first=Eric|date=November 7, 2002|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=May 12, 2017}}</ref> [[Trent Reznor]] of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash's plan to cover "Hurt", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |title=Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor |magazine=Alternative Press |date=June 26, 2004 |access-date=October 15, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015203101/http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |archive-date=October 15, 2017 }}</ref> The video for "Hurt" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos – Johnny Cash, Hurt|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085375,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214843/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085375,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 26, 2011|magazine=Time|access-date=August 19, 2011|first=Glen|last=Levy| date=July 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|url=https://www.nme.com/list/100-greatest-music-videos/217342/page/10|publisher=[[NME]]|access-date=December 15, 2012|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>

He even performed surprise shows at the [[Carter Family Fold]] outside [[Bristol, Virginia]]. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing "Ring of Fire", Cash read a statement that he had written shortly before taking the stage:

{{blockquote|The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She's never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart.}}

Cash continued to record until shortly before his death. "When June died, it tore him up", Rick Rubin recalled. "He said to me, 'You have to keep me working because I will die if I don't have something to do.' He was in a wheelchair by then and we set him up at his home in Virginia… I couldn't listen to those recordings for two years after he died and it was heartbreaking when he died."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The Q Interview: Rick Rubin|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=October 2009|page=98}}</ref> Cash's final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of "Like the 309", which appeared on ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' in 2006, and the final song he completed, "Engine 143", recorded for his son John Carter Cash's planned Carter Family tribute album.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of [[love letter]]s.{{Sfn|Turner|2004|pp=43–44}} On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. They had four daughters: [[Rosanne Cash|Rosanne]], Kathy, [[Cindy Cash|Cindy]], and Tara. In 1961, Cash moved his family to a hilltop home overlooking [[Casitas Springs, California]]. He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement. Liberto later said that she had filed for divorce in 1966 because of Cash's severe drug and alcohol abuse, as well as his constant touring, his repeated acts of [[adultery]] with other women, and his close relationship with singer [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]]. Their four daughters were then raised by their mother.

Cash met June of the famed [[Carter Family]] while on tour, and the two became infatuated with each other. In 1968, thirteen years after they first met backstage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], Cash proposed to June, during a live performance in [[London, Ontario]].<ref>{{Citation|place=London, UK|last=Sweeting|first=Adam|date=September 12, 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/sep/12/johnnycash|type=Obituary|title=Johnny Cash|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=January 26, 2009}}</ref> The couple married on March 1, 1968, in [[Franklin, Kentucky]].

Cash and Carter continued to work, raise their child, create music, and tour together for 35 years until June's death in May 2003. Throughout their marriage, June attempted to keep Cash off [[amphetamines]], often taking his drugs and flushing them down the toilet. June remained with him even throughout his multiple admissions for rehabilitation treatment and decades of [[drug addiction]]. After June's death in May 2003, Cash believed that his only reason for living was his music; he died only four months later.<ref>Puterbaugh, Parke. "Essential Johnny Cash."

Cash nurtured and defended artists (such as Bob Dylan<ref name="pc10" />) on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment's most visible symbol. At an all-star concert which aired in 1999 on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Dylan, [[Chris Isaak]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Norah Jones]], Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, [[Dom DeLuise]], and U2. Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year. Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; ''[[Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash|Kindred Spirits]]'' contains works from established artists, while ''[[Dressed in Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash|Dressed in Black]]'' contains works from many lesser-known musicians.

In total, he wrote over 1,000 songs and released dozens of albums. A [[box set]] titled ''[[Unearthed (Johnny Cash album)|Unearthed]]'' was issued posthumously.

{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote=If there were a hall of fame for creating larger-than-life personae, Cash would no doubt have been elected to it as well. His 1971 song "Man in Black" codified an image that the singer had assumed naturally for more than fifteen years at that point. Part rural preacher, part outlaw Robin Hood, he was a blue-collar prophet who, dressed in stark contrast to the glinting rhinestones and shimmering psychedelia of the time, spoke truth to power.|source=—Johnny Cash: Remembering the Incomparable Legend of Country, Rock and Roll, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="RS Cash"/>}}
Cash received multiple [[Country Music Association Awards]], Grammys, and other awards, in categories ranging from vocal and spoken performances to album notes and videos. In a career that spanned almost five decades, Cash was the personification of country music to many people around the world. Cash was a musician who was not defined by a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]], and exerted an influence on each of those genres.

His diversity was evidenced by his presence in five major music halls of fame: the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1980), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992), GMA's [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2010). and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] (2013).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/johnny-cash|publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash|access-date=May 2, 2017|archive-date=May 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504125420/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/johnny-cash|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/johnny-cash|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash}}</ref> Marking his death in 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' stated other than [[Elvis Presley]] Cash was the only artist inducted as a performer into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<ref name="RS Cash">{{cite news |title=Johnny Cash: Remembering the Incomparable Legend of Country, Rock and Roll |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/johnny-cash-remembering-the-incomparable-legend-of-country-rock-and-roll-244037/ |access-date=April 1, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

[[Judy Collins discography|Her discography]] consists of 36 studio albums, nine live albums, numerous compilation albums, four holiday albums, and 21 [[single (music)|singles]].

Collins' debut studio album, ''[[A Maid of Constant Sorrow]]'', was released in 1961 and consisted of traditional [[Folk music|folk songs]]. She had her first charting single with "Hard Lovin' Loser" (No. 97) from her fifth studio album ''[[In My Life (Judy Collins album)|In My Life]]'' (1966), but it was the [[lead single]] from her sixth studio album ''[[Wildflowers (Judy Collins album)|Wildflowers]]'' (1967), "[[Both Sides, Now]]" – written by [[Joni Mitchell]] – that gave her international prominence. The single reached No. 8 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Singles chart]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/305342/judy-collins/chart |title=Judy Collins – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 30, 2015}}</ref> and won Collins her first [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording|Best Folk Performance]].<ref name="Gram">{{cite news |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/judy-collins/12213 |title=Judy Collins |access-date=January 19, 2021}}</ref> She enjoyed further success with her recordings of "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]", "[[Chelsea Morning]]" (also written by Mitchell), "[[Amazing Grace]]", "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", and "Cook with Honey".

Collins experienced the biggest success of her career with her recording of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s "[[Send in the Clowns]]" from her tenth studio album ''[[Judith (album)|Judith]]'' (1975). The single peaked at No. 36 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart in 1975 and then again in 1977 at No. 19, spending 27 non-consecutive weeks on the chart and earning her a Grammy Award nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female]], as well as a Grammy Award for Sondheim for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/stephen-sondheim/12557 |title=Stephen Sondheim |access-date=January 19, 2021}}</ref> ''Judith'' also became her best-selling studio album; it was certified [[Music recording certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1975 for sales of over 500,000 copies and [[Music recording certification|Platinum]] in 1996 for sales of over 1,000,000 copies.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite certification |region=United States|certyear=2014|type=album|artist=Judy Collins}}</ref>

In 2017, Collins's rendition of the song "[[Amazing Grace (song)|Amazing Grace]]" was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref name="Library of Congress">{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-029/ | title=National Recording Registry Picks Are "Over the Rainbow" | work=Library of Congress | date=March 29, 2016 | access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> That same year, she received a Grammy Award nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album|Best Folk Album]] for ''[[Silver Skies Blue]]'' with [[Ari Hest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/features/singer-judy-collins-grammy-nomination-1201979543/ |title=Judy Collins Talks Her First Grammy Nomination in 40 Years: 'I've Been Working All This Time |work=Variety.com |date=February 8, 2017 |access-date=October 27, 2017}}</ref> In 2019 at the age of 80, she scored her first No. 1 album on an American ''Billboard'' Chart with ''[[Winter Stories (album)|Winter Stories]]'', a duet album with Norwegian singer, songwriter, and guitarist [[Jonas Fjeld]] featuring [[Chatham County Line]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546731/judy-collins-first-career-billboard-number-one-winter-stories/item/prn-17-029/ | title= Judy Scores First Career Number 1 | magazine= Billboard | date=June 13, 2020 | access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> In 2022, she released her first studio album of all original material, titled ''[[Spellbound (Judy Collins album)|Spellbound]]'', and it earned her another Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album.

==Early life==
Collins was born the eldest of five siblings in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] where she lived for the first ten years of her life. Her father, Chuck Collins (a [[visual impairment|blind]] singer, pianist, and radio show host) took a job in [[Denver]] in 1949 and the family moved there. Her grandfather on her father's side was Irish.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ellie |last=O'Byrne |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30977085.html |title=The songs that matter most to Judy Collins from her 60-year career |newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]] |issn=1393-9564 |location=Cork |language=en-ie |date=January 22, 2020 |access-date=March 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.irishmusicdaily.com/blog/judy-collins-on-her-love-of-irish-music |title=Judy Collins speaks about her love of Irish music |first=Patrick |last=Kehoe |date=November 29, 2021 |website=irishmusicdaily.com}}</ref> 

Judy Collins contracted [[polio]] at the age of 11 and spent two months in isolation in a hospital.<ref>{{cite web|author=Interview by Wendy Schuman|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Celebrities/Judy-Collins-Tell-The-Truth-No-Matter-How-Hard.aspx|title=Judy Collins tells Beliefnet how she used meditation and prayer to cope with illness and her son's suicide.|publisher=Beliefnet.com|date=February 17, 2011|access-date=October 16, 2012}}</ref> She grew up listening to the [[Irish traditional music|traditional Irish music]] her father sang. She did not know what folk music was when she was young. She said, "I just thought it was probably [[Rodgers and Hart]]. Those were the songs he (her father) sang on the radio. I didn't understand until I discovered [[The Whistling Gypsy|''The Gypsy Rover'']] and [[Barbara Allen (song)|''Barbara Allen'']] when I was 15. I didn't realize I had been singing ''[[Danny Boy]]'' all of that time... ''Danny Boy'' was a folk song.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://irishmusicdaily.com/blog/judy-collins-on-her-love-of-irish-music |title=Judy Collins Speaks About Her Love of Irish Music|first=Patrick|last=Kehoe|date=November 29, 2021|access-date=June 6, 2024|website=irishmusicdaily.com}}</ref>

==Career==
===Beginnings===
[[File:Judy Collins Hootenanny 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|Collins during a 1963 appearance on ''[[Hootenanny (TV series)|Hootenanny]]'']]
Collins studied classical piano with [[Antonia Brico]], making her public debut at age 13 performing [[Piano Concerto No. 10 (Mozart)|Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos]]. She also played [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] as a child.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ellie|last=O'Byrne |url=https://irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30977085.html|title=The Songs that Matter Most to Judy Collins from Her 60-year Career|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|issn=1393-9564 |location=Cork|language=en-ie|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=June 6, 2024}}</ref> Brico took a dim view of her developing interest in folk music, which led her to the difficult decision to discontinue her piano lessons. Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico to one of her concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins' hands into hers, looked wistfully at her fingers and said, "Little Judy—you really could have gone places." Still later, she discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing [[jazz]] and [[ragtime]] piano (''Singing Lessons'', pp.&nbsp;71–72). In her early life, she met many professional musicians through her father.<ref>{{cite book|last=Malkoski|first=Paul A.|title=The Denver Folk Music Tradition: An Unplugged History, from Harry Tuft to Swallow Hill and Beyond|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1609495329|page=52}}</ref>

It was the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Pete Seeger]] and the [[Folk music|traditional]] songs of the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] of the early 1960s, however, that kindled Collins' interest and awoke in her a love for [[lyrics]]. Three years after her debut as a piano [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], she was playing guitar. Her first public appearances as a folk artist after her graduation from Denver's East High School were at Michael's Pub in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and the folk club Exodus in Denver. Her music became popular at the [[University of Connecticut]], where her husband taught. She performed at parties and for the campus radio station along with [[David Grisman]] and Tom Azarian.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,526497,00.html|title=Time "Striking a Chord"|website=Time.com|access-date=August 20, 2021|archive-date=March 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319133053/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,526497,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===1960s===
Collins eventually made her way to [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]] where she played in clubs like Gerde's Folk City until she signed with [[Elektra Records]], a label she was associated with for 35 years. In 1961, she released her debut studio album, ''[[A Maid of Constant Sorrow]]'', at age 22.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reviews of new albums|date=November 27, 1961|magazine=Billboard|page=28}}</ref>

At first, Collins sang traditional folk songs or songs written by others–in particular the protest songwriters of the time, such as [[Tom Paxton]], [[Phil Ochs]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. She recorded her own versions of important songs from the period, such as Dylan's "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" and [[Pete Seeger]]'s "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]". She was also instrumental in bringing little-known musicians to a wider public. For example, she recorded songs by Canadian poet [[Leonard Cohen]], who became a close friend over the years. She also recorded songs by singer-songwriters such as [[Eric Andersen]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Robin Williamson]], and [[Richard Fariña]] long before they gained national acclaim.<ref>{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Sylvie|title=I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen|year=2012|publisher=McClelland & Stewart|isbn=978-0771080401}}</ref><ref name=newman>{{cite book|last=Courrier|first=Kevin|author-link=Kevin Courrier|title=Randy Newman: American Dreams|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1550226904|pages=65–66}}</ref>

[[File:JodyCollins-Oct1965.jpg|thumb|right|Judy Collins in 1965]]
Collins' first few studio albums consisted of straightforward guitar-based folk songs, but with her fifth studio album ''[[In My Life (Judy Collins album)|In My Life]]'' (1966), she began branching out to include works from such diverse sources as [[the Beatles]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Jacques Brel]], and [[Kurt Weill]].<ref name=newman/> [[Mark Abramson]] produced and [[Joshua Rifkin]] arranged the album, adding lush [[orchestration]] to many of the numbers. The album was a major departure for a folk artist and set the course for Collins' subsequent work over the next decade.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000195828|label=''In My Life'' review|access-date=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

With her sixth studio album ''[[Wildflowers (Judy Collins album)|Wildflowers]]'' (1967), also produced by Abramson and arranged by Rifkin, Collins began to record her own compositions, beginning with "Since You Asked". The album also provided her with a major hit and a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] in Mitchell's "[[Both Sides, Now]]", which in December 1968 reached No. 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=judy collins|chart=all}} |title=Judy Collins|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=March 16, 2013}}</ref> later (February 1970) reaching No. 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19700222/7501/|title=Official [U.K.] Singles Chart Top 50, 22 February 1970–28 February 1970|publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|access-date=December 17, 2021}}</ref>

Collins' seventh studio album ''[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes (Judy Collins album)|Who Knows Where the Time Goes]]'' (1968) was produced by [[David Anderle]], and featured back-up guitar by [[Stephen Stills]] (of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]]), with whom she was romantically involved at the time. (She was the inspiration for Stills's CSN classic "[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]".) ''Time Goes'' had a mellow [[country music|country]] sound and included [[Ian Tyson]]'s "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]" and the title track, written by the UK singer-songwriter [[Sandy Denny]]. The album also featured Collins' composition "My Father" and one of the first covers of Leonard Cohen's "[[Bird on the Wire]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Judy Collins Concert: Has Fans Gentle on Her Mind|date=May 24, 1969|magazine=Billboard|page=22}}</ref>

Two of Collins' songs ("[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes?]]" composed by Sandy Denny and "Albatross") were featured in the 1968 film ''[[The Subject Was Roses (film)|The Subject Was Roses]]''.

===1970s===
By the 1970s, Collins had a solid reputation as an [[art song]] singer and folksinger and had begun to stand out for her own compositions. She was also known for her broad range of material: her songs from this period include the traditional Christian [[hymn]] "[[Amazing Grace]]", the [[Stephen Sondheim]] [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] [[ballad]] "[[Send in the Clowns]]" (both of which were top 20 hits as singles in both the U.S. and the U.K.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/13893/judy-collins/|title=JUDY COLLINS|publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|access-date=December 17, 2021}}</ref>), a recording of [[Joan Baez]]'s "[[One Day at a Time (Joan Baez album)|A Song for David]]", and her own compositions, such as "Born to the Breed".<ref>{{cite news|last=Santosuosso|first=Ernie|title=Judy Collins' flight of fancy|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=May 11, 1975}}</ref>

In 1971, Collins issued her second live album, ''[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]'', and the compilation album ''[[Colors of the Day: The Best of Judy Collins]]'' followed a year later. Collins' ninth studio album ''[[True Stories and Other Dreams]]'' (1973) found her in a contemplative mood, featuring an original song about a friend who took his own life ("Song for Martin") and another about the life of Argentine [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] ("Che"). For her tenth studio album ''[[Judith (album)|Judith]]'' (1975), she collaborated with producer [[Arif Mardin]], who gave the album a sophisticated sound. ''Judith'' produced her biggest hit single with her mournful version of Stephen Sondheim's "[[Send in the Clowns]]", and it would become her best-selling record, eventually going platinum.

As Collins stepped up to a higher level of stardom, the longtime activist put political themes at the forefront of her eleventh studio album  ''[[Bread and Roses (album)|Bread and Roses]]'' (1976). Political statements like the title song, originally a poem by [[James Oppenheim]] commonly associated with a 1912 [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|garment workers strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], were balanced with such pop compositions as [[Elton John]]'s "Come Down in Time", but the album failed to achieve the commercial success of ''Judith''. Following the release of the album, Collins underwent treatment for damaged vocal cords, and after years of struggling with alcoholism, she sought medical help to give up drinking. Her compilation album ''[[So Early in the Spring (Judy Collins album)|So Early in the Spring... The First 15 Years]]'' (1977) sold modestly.

Collins guest starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in an episode broadcast in January 1978,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0786442591|page=[https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218 218]|url=https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218}}</ref> singing "[[Leather-Winged Bat]]", "[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]", "[[Do-Re-Mi]]", and "Send in the Clowns". She also appeared several times on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', where she performed "Fishermen's Song" with a chorus of [[Anything Muppet]] fishermen, sang a trio with [[Biff and Sully]] using the word "yes", and even starred in a modern musical fairy tale skit called "The Sad Princess".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ann|first=Lolordo|title=Judy Collins changing styles|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=August 13, 1977}}</ref> In 1979, she returned to music with her twelfth studio album ''[[Hard Times for Lovers]]'', a pop-oriented album in the same vein as ''Judith''; she gained some extra publicity with the cover sleeve photograph of her in the nude.

===1980s===
''[[Running for My Life]]'' (1980) and ''[[Times of Our Lives (Judy Collins album)|Times of Our Lives]]'' (1982) were well-crafted exercises in adult pop and soft rock, but as tastes changed, Collins' sales were on the decline. ''[[Home Again (Judy Collins album)|Home Again]]'' (1984) found her exploring some new musical avenues, including a synth-based cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz's]] "Only You" and a duet with country star [[T. G. Sheppard]] on the title cut. While the "Home Again" single was a minor hit, the album was not, and after 23 years, Collins and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] parted ways. She performed the music for the 1983 animated television special ''[[The Magic of Herself the Elf]]'', as well as the theme song of the [[Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment|Rankin/Bass Productions]] television film ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1987 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woolery|first=George W.|title=Animated TV Specials|year=1989|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810821989|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool}}</ref>

Collins traveled to England in 1985 and struck a one-off deal with Telstar Records to record the studio album ''[[Amazing Grace (Judy Collins album)|Amazing Grace]]'', in which she re-recorded several of her better-known songs with an inspirational bent. In 1987, she signed with the independent [[Gold Castle Records|Gold Castle]] label, and her first studio album for them, ''[[Trust Your Heart]]'', which collected seven tracks from ''Amazing Grace'' and added three new selections. That same year, she released her first memoir, ''Trust Your Heart''.<ref name="judycollins.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.judycollins.com/books|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211121113722/http://www.judycollins.com/books|url-status=live|archive-date=November 21, 2021|title=Judy Collins Official Website – Books|access-date=March 11, 2022}}</ref>

==Activism==
Like many other folk singers of her generation, Collins was drawn to social activism. Her political idealism led her to compose a ballad, ''Che,'' in honor of the 1960s [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/friday/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/friday/124591870160950.xml&coll=2 Collins doesn't rest on laurels but looks for songs' surprises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607160541/http://www.cleveland.com/friday/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Ffriday%2F124591870160950.xml&coll=2 |date=June 7, 2011 }} by John Soeder, ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', June 26, 2009</ref> Collins sympathized with the [[Youth International Party|Yippie]] movement and was friendly with its leaders, [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]]. On March 17, 1968, she went to Hoffman's press conference at the Americana Hotel in New York to announce the party's formation. In 1969, she testified in [[Chicago]] in support of the [[Chicago Seven]]; during her testimony, she began singing [[Pete Seeger]]'s "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" and was admonished by prosecutor [[Tom Foran]] and judge [[Julius Hoffman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chicago7/Collins.html|title=Testimony of Judy Collins in the Chicago Seven Trial|publisher=Law.umkc.edu|date=August 19, 1968|access-date=September 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619235723/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/Collins.html|archive-date=June 19, 2010}}</ref>

In 1971, Collins signed her name to a ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms]]''. campaign, "We Have Had Abortions", which called for an end to "archaic laws" regarding [[abortion]] rights; the campaign encouraged women to share their stories and take action.

==Personal life==
Collins has been married twice. She was married to Peter Taylor in 1958 and they had her only child, Clark C. Taylor, who was born the same year. The marriage ended in divorce in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography for Judy Collins|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172423/bio|access-date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> In April 1996, she married industrial designer [[Louis Nelson (artist)|Louis Nelson]], whom she had been seeing since April 1978.

Collins suffered from [[bulimia nervosa]] after she quit smoking in the 1970s. "I went straight from the cigarettes into an [[eating disorder]]", she told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine in 1992. "I started throwing up. I didn't know anything about bulimia, certainly not that it is an addiction or that it would get worse. My feelings about myself, even though I had been able to give up smoking and lose 20 pounds, were of increasing despair." 

She wrote at length of her years of addiction to alcohol, the damage it did to her personal and musical life and how it contributed to her feelings of depression.<ref>{{cite book|first=Judy|last=Collins|title=Singing lessons: a memoir of love, loss, hope and healing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBIJPmrOwNMC&pg=PA127|access-date=November 16, 2010|date=October 1998|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-00397-5|pages=172–190, 238–240}}</ref> She admits that although she tried other drugs in the 1960s, alcohol had always been her drug of first choice just as it had been for her father. She entered a rehabilitation program in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1978 and has maintained her sobriety ever since, even through such traumatic events as the death of her only child, Clark, by suicide in 1992 at age 33 after a long bout with clinical depression and substance abuse. Since then, she has also become an activist for suicide prevention.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-06-18-judy-collins_n.htm | title=Son's suicide prodded Collins to write | newspaper=USA Today | date=June 18, 2007 | access-date=November 25, 2013 | author=Hellmich, Nanci}}</ref>

'''Jamieson "Junior" Brown''' (born June 12, 1952)<ref>{{cite news |title= Today in history |publisher= [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |date= June 12, 2014 |url= https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/today-history-24100059?singlePage=true |agency= [[Associated Press]]}}</ref> is an American [[country music|country]] guitarist and singer. He has released twelve studio albums in his career, and has charted twice on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country singles charts]]. Brown's signature instrument is the "guit-steel" [[double neck guitar]], a hybrid of electric guitar and [[lap steel guitar]].

==Life and career==
Brown was born in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]]; at an early age his family moved to [[Kirksville, Indiana]].<ref name="juniorbrown1"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmt.com/artists/az/brown_junior/bio.jhtml|title=CMT.com : Junior Brown : Biography|date=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227034135/https://www.cmt.com/artists/az/brown_junior/bio.jhtml |accessdate=May 29, 2023|archive-date=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> He first learned to play piano from his father (Samuel Emmons Brown Jr.) "before I could talk". His music career began in the 1960s, and he worked through that decade and the next singing and playing pedal steel and guitar for groups such as The Last Mile Ramblers, Dusty Drapes and the Dusters, Billy Spears and [[Asleep at the Wheel]] while developing his guitar skills.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} In the early 1980s, he appeared on stage with [[Rank and File (band)|Rank and File]] as the replacement for [[Alejandro Escovedo]]. However, he did not feature on any recordings by that band.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

By the mid-1980s, Brown was teaching guitar at the [[Hank Thompson (music)|Hank Thompson]] School of Country Music at [[Rogers State University]], in [[Claremore, Oklahoma]].

In 1985, Brown created a new type of [[double-neck guitar]], with some assistance from Michael Stevens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stevensguitars.com/models/guit-steel/|title=Guit-Steel|website=Stevensguitars.com|date=April 3, 2009|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/gear/reviews/those-daring-young-men-and-their-doubleneck-guitars-a-brief-history-of-multi-neck-players|title=Those Daring Young Men and Their Doubleneck Guitars: A Brief History of Multi-Neck Players - Premier Guitar|website=Premierguitar.com|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref> Brown called the instrument his "guit-steel". When performing, Brown plays the guitar by standing behind it, while it rests on a small [[music stand]]. The top neck on the guit-steel is a traditional six-string guitar, while the lower neck is a full-size [[lap steel|lap steel guitar]] for slide playing. Brown has two guit-steels for recording and live work. The original instrument, dubbed "Old Yeller", has as its standard six-string guitar portion the neck and pickups from Brown's previous stage guitar, a [[Fender Bullet]]. The second guit-steel, named "Big Red", has a neck laser-copied from the Bullet neck; but in addition to electric guitar pickups, both the standard and lap-steel necks use identical [[Sho-Bud]] lap-steel pickups. There is a pocket in the upper bout of the guitar to hold the slide bar when it is not in use. Brown also commissioned a "pedal guit-steel" which adds pedals to the instrument for more musical control.<ref name="americanamusicshow.com">{{Cite web|url=https://americanamusicshow.com/junior-brown/|title=Junior Brown - Interview and Music|first=Calvin|last=Powers|website=Americanmusicshow.com|date=November 26, 2012|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref> Brown has stated that the invention of the guit-steel was always a matter of convenience so that he could play both lap steel and lead guitar during live performances and not directly motivated by a desire to be a "one man band".<ref name="americanamusicshow.com"/>

[[File:Junior Brown 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Junior Brown performing at the 2014 [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] Blues Festival]]
Brown quickly became a local success in [[Austin, Texas]], as the house band at the Continental Club. His debut album was ''12 Shades of Brown'' (1990), released by the British [[Demon Records]]; it was re-released in 1993 on [[Curb Records]] in the United States, followed by ''Guit with It''. In 1996, Brown released ''[[Semi Crazy]]'', and followed it with ''[[Long Walk Back]]'' (1998).

In 1996, Brown was featured on the [[Beach Boys]]' now out-of-print album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'' performing a cover of their 1962 hit "409". The song features Brown playing guitar and singing lead with the Beach Boys singing harmonies and backing vocals.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Brown appeared in the music video for "Honky Tonk Song" by [[George Jones]] in 1996 and also won the CMA Country Music Video of the Year award that year for his video, "My Wife Thinks You're Dead", which featured 6-foot-7-inch Gwendolyn Gillingham.<ref>{{cite news |title= The Return of Junior Brown |publisher= Country Music Television News |date= October 1, 2004 |url= http://www.cmt.com/news/1491681/the-return-of-junior-brown/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225216/http://www.cmt.com/news/1491681/the-return-of-junior-brown/|url-status= dead|archive-date= November 29, 2018}}</ref> Brown played a cameo part in "[[Drive (The X-Files)|Drive]]", the second episode of season six of ''[[The X-Files]]''. Brown's music has been showcased on various television series and movie soundtracks, including ''[[Me, Myself & Irene]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and the 2005 ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|Dukes of Hazzard]]'' remake, in which he also played the narrator.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Although Brown plays such [[neotraditional country]] styles as [[honky-tonk]], [[Western swing]], etc., some of his performances will finish with some [[blues]] and [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] tunes playing as well as [[Surf music|surf rock]] instrumentals.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Beginning in August 2006, Brown joined [[Webb Wilder]]'s tour of American minor league baseball stadiums.

'''Lester William Polsfuss''' (June 9, 1915 – August 12, 2009), known as '''Les Paul''', was an American [[jazz guitarist|jazz]], [[country guitarist|country]], and [[blues]] guitarist, songwriter, [[luthier]], and inventor. He was one of the pioneers of the [[solid body|solid-body]] electric guitar, and his prototype, called the Log, served as inspiration for the [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smithsonianassociates.org/programs/paul/paul.asp |title=Voices from the Smithsonian Associates.

At the age of eight, Paul began playing the harmonica. After learning the piano, he switched to the banjo and guitar.  During this time, Paul invented a neck-worn harmonica holder, which allowed him to play both sides of the harmonica, hands-free, while performing on the banjo and guitar.  Les Paul's hands-free design is still widely manufactured today.<ref>(August 14, 2009).

==Career==

===Early career===
Paul and Wolverton moved to Chicago in 1934, where they continued to perform country music on radio station [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] and at the 1934 Chicago World's Fair. While in Chicago, Paul learned jazz from the great performers on Chicago's Southside. During the day, he played country music as Rhubarb Red on the radio. At night, he was Les Paul, playing jazz. He met pianist [[Art Tatum]], whose playing influenced him to continue with the guitar rather than play jazz on the piano.<ref name="Les Paul: The Living Legend of the Electric Guitar">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicjazzguitar.com/articles/article.jsp?article=25 |title=ClassicJazzGuitar.com |publisher=ClassicJazzGuitar.com |access-date=2012-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313012503/http://classicjazzguitar.com/articles/article.jsp?article=25 |archive-date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref> His first two records were released in 1936, credited to "Rhubarb Red", Paul's hillbilly alter ego.

Paul's guitar style was strongly influenced by the music of [[Django Reinhardt]], whom he greatly admired.<ref>Cook, Kenneth. "Book Review: "The Music of Django Reinhardt," by Benjamin Givan." ''ARSC Journal'' 42.1 (2011): 86–87.</ref> Following [[World War II]], Paul sought out and made friends with Reinhardt.

While jamming in his apartment basement in 1941,<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> Paul nearly succumbed to electrocution. During two years of recuperation, he moved to Chicago where he was the music director for radio stations WJJD and WIND. In 1943, he moved to Hollywood where he performed on radio and formed a new trio.

He was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1943,<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> where he served in the [[Armed Forces Radio Network]], backing such artists as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[the Andrews Sisters]], and performing in his own right.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tianen |first=Dave |title=The Wizard of Waukesha |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=August 26, 2009 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/les-paul/chasing-sound/100/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225154555/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/les-paul/chasing-sound/100/ |archive-date=February 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

As a last-minute replacement for [[Oscar Moore]], Paul played with [[Nat King Cole]] and other artists in the inaugural [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] concert in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], on July 2, 1944. His solo on "[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]" is a demonstration of his admiration for and emulation of Django Reinhardt, as well as his development of original lines.

Also that year, Paul's trio appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show. Crosby sponsored Paul's recordings. They recorded together several times, including "[[It's Been a Long, Long Time]]", which was a No. 1 hit<ref name="SoundOnSound"/> in 1945. Paul recorded several albums for [[Decca Records|Decca]] in the 1940s. [[The Andrews Sisters]] hired his trio to open for them during a tour in 1946. Their manager, Lou Levy, said watching Paul's fingers while he played guitar was like watching a train go by.<ref name="autogenerated2000">Sforza, John: "Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages.</ref> Their conductor, [[Vic Schoen]], said his playing was always original.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/>  Maxine Andrews said, "He'd tune into the passages we were singing and lightly play the melody, sometimes in harmony. We'd sing these fancy licks and he'd keep up with us note for note in exactly the same rhythm... almost contributing a fourth voice. But he never once took the attention away from what we were doing. He did everything he could to make us sound better."<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> In the 1950s, when he recorded Mary Ford's vocals on multiple tracks, he created music that sounded like [[the Andrews Sisters]].<ref name="autogenerated2000"/>

In January 1948, Paul shattered his right arm and elbow among multiple injuries in a near-fatal automobile accident on an icy [[Route 66]] west of [[Davenport, Oklahoma|Davenport]], [[Oklahoma]]. Mary Ford was driving the [[Buick]] convertible, which plunged off the side of a railroad overpass and dropped twenty feet into a ravine. They were returning from Wisconsin to Los Angeles after visiting family.<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> Doctors at Oklahoma City's Wesley Hospital told Paul that they could not rebuild his elbow. Their other option was [[amputation]]. Paul was flown to Los Angeles, where his arm was set at an angle—just over 90 degrees—that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar. It took him nearly a year and a half to recover.<ref name=freshair>{{cite web |author=Fresh Air from WHYY |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111888401 |title=Guitar Hero: Les Paul, 1915–2009 |website = NPR.org|access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628211807/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111888401 |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Guitar builder===

{{anchor|The Log}}
In 1940, Les Paul revisited his experiments with the train rail. This time he created a similar prototype instrument, a one-off solid-body electric guitar known as "The Log", which was manufactured utilizing a common construction material often referred as a “4×4 stud post”, which provided a unique neck-thru design.  The “stud post” (a 4″ × 4″ section of [[Douglas fir]]) was then equipped with a crude bridge and an electromagnetic [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], neck and strings.  The Log was constructed by Paul after-hours in the New York City [[Epiphone]] guitar factory, and is one of the first solid-body electric guitars.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dkimages.com/discover/Home/Performing-Arts/Music/Instruments/String/Guitars/Electric-Guitar/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-01.html |title= The Log |publisher= DK Images |access-date= March 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110710140434/http://www.dkimages.com/discover/Home/Performing-Arts/Music/Instruments/String/Guitars/Electric-Guitar/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-01.html |archive-date= July 10, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Epiphone: A History|url=http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx|publisher=Epiphone.com|access-date=February 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104095251/http://www.epiphone.com/History.aspx|archive-date=November 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  For the sake of appearance, he attached the body of an [[Epiphone]] hollow-body guitar sawn lengthwise with The Log in the middle. This solved his two main problems: [[Audio feedback|feedback]], as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound, and sustain, as the energy of the strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the guitar body. These instruments were constantly being improved and modified over the years, and Paul continued to use them in his recordings even after the development of his eponymous Gibson model.

Paul approached the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] with his idea of a solid-body electric guitar in 1941,<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> 
but Gibson showed no interest until Fender began marketing its [[Fender Esquire|Esquire]] and [[Telecaster|Broadcaster]] guitars in 1950 (the Broadcaster was renamed the Telecaster in 1952).

Gibson's [[Ted McCarty]] was the chief designer of the guitar, which was based on Paul's drawings and later dubbed the [[Gibson Les Paul]]. Gibson entered into a promotional and financial arrangement with Les Paul, paying him a royalty on sales.<ref name=Lawrence2008>{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Robb|title=The Early Years of the Les Paul Legacy: 1915–1963|year=2008|publisher=Hal Leonard Corp|isbn=978-0634048616|page=304}}</ref> The guitar went on sale in 1952. Paul continued to  make design suggestions.

In 1960, sales of the original Les Paul model had dropped, so a more modernistic model was introduced (today called the SG), but then still bearing the Les Paul name. Not liking the new look and  severe problems with the strength of the body and neck, made Paul dissatisfied with this new Gibson guitar. This, and a pending divorce from [[Mary Ford]], led to Paul ending his endorsement and use of his name on Gibson guitars from 1964 until 1966, by which time his divorce was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jinxmagazine.com/les_paul.html |title= Interview &#124; July 19, 1999, at the Iridium jazz club, New York City |publisher= Jinx Magazine |date= July 19, 1999 |access-date= March 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713110152/http://www.jinxmagazine.com/les_paul.html |archive-date= July 13, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref>

{{anchor|Headless guitar}}
Paul continued to suggest technical improvements, although they were not always successful commercially. In 1962, Paul was issued {{US Patent|3,018,680}}, for a pickup in which the coil was integrated into the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3018680 |title= Patents | access-date = March 27, 2011}}</ref> In the mid-1940s, he introduced an aluminum guitar with the tuning mechanisms below the bridge. As it had no headstock, and the string attachments were at the nut, it was the first "headless" guitar. Unfortunately, Paul's guitar was so sensitive to the heat from stage lights that it would not keep tune. However, he used it for several of his hit recordings. This style was further developed by others, most successfully Ned [[Steinberger]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lespaulfoundation.org/sevenpages/page1.htm |title=Les Paul Guitar Innovations |access-date=2014-03-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140311025027/http://lespaulfoundation.org/sevenpages/page1.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

A less-expensive version of the Les Paul guitar is manufactured for Gibson's [[Epiphone]] brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Epiphone Les Paul Standard|url=http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-Standard.aspx|publisher=Epiphone.com|access-date=February 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218185620/http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-Standard.aspx|archive-date=February 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Multitrack recording===
Paul first experimented with sound on sound while in elementary school when he punched holes in the [[piano roll]] for his mother's [[player piano]]. In 1946,  his mother complimented him on a song she had heard on the radio, when in fact she had heard George Barnes, not Paul.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kane|first1=Brian|title=Acousmatic Fabrications: Les Paul and the 'Les Paulverizer' |journal=Journal of Visual Culture|date=August 2011|volume=10|issue=2|page=216|doi=10.1177/1470412911402892|s2cid=193109700}}</ref> This motivated Paul to spend two years in his Hollywood garage recording studio, creating his unique sound, his New Sound. Paul stunned the music industry with his New Sound in 1948.

Paul recorded several songs with Bing Crosby, most notably "[[It's Been a Long, Long Time]]," which was a number-one single in 1945.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waksman|first1=Steve|title=Les Paul: In Memoriam|journal=Popular Music & Society|date=May 2010|volume=33|issue=2|page=271|doi=10.1080/03007761003707944|s2cid=191470269}}</ref><ref name="SoundOnSound"/>

After a recording session, Bing Crosby suggested that Paul build a recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted. Paul started his studio in the garage of his home on North Curson Street in Hollywood. The studio drew many vocalists and musicians who wanted the benefit of his expertise. His experiments included microphone placement, track speed, and recording overdubs. These methods resulted in a clarity previously unheard in this type of multitrack recording. People began to consider his recording techniques as instruments—as important to production as a guitar, bass, or drums.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waksman|first1=Steve|title=Les Paul: In Memoriam|journal=Popular Music & Society|date=May 2010|volume=33|issue=2|page=3|doi=10.1080/03007761003707944|s2cid=191470269}}</ref>

Capitol Records released "[[Lover (When You're Near Me)]]", on which Paul played eight different parts on electric guitar,<ref name="SoundOnSound"/> some recorded at half-speed, hence "double-fast" when played back at normal speed for the [[master recording|master]]. This was the first time he used multitracking in a recording. His early multitrack recordings, including "Lover" and "Brazil", were made with [[acetate disc]]s. He recorded a track onto a disk, then recorded himself playing another part with the first. He built the multitrack recording with overlaid tracks rather than parallel ones as he did later. By the time he had a result that satisfied him, he had discarded some five hundred recording disks.

As a teen he had built a disc-cutter assembly using the flywheel from a [[Cadillac]], a dental belt and other parts from his father's car repair shop. Years later in his Hollywood garage, he used the acetate disc setup to record parts at different speeds and with delay, resulting in his signature sound with echoes and birdsong-like guitar riffs.

In 1949, Crosby gave Paul one of the first [[Ampex]] Model 200A [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel to reel tape recorders]].<ref name="Les Paul In His Own Words"/> Paul invented sound on sound recording using this machine by placing an additional playback head, located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads. This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track, both of which were mixed together onto a new track. The Ampex was a monophonic tape recorder with only one track across the entire width of quarter-inch tape, and therefore, the recording was "destructive" in the sense that the original recording was permanently replaced with the new, mixed recording. He eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track. This preserved the original recording.<ref name="aes.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/sel-sync/snyder_sel-sync.pdf |title=Sel-sync and the "Octopus": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs |work=ARSC Journal |access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519105331/http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/sel-sync/snyder_sel-sync.pdf |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Les Paul and Mary Ford===
{{main|Les Paul and Mary Ford}}
[[File:Les Paul and Mary Ford 1954.jpg|thumb|Paul and Mary Ford in 1954]]
In the summer of 1945, Paul met country-western singer Iris Colleen Summers. They began working together on Paul's radio show, as Rhubarb Red and The Ozark Apple Knockers with Mary Lou. Later Paul suggested the stage name [[Mary Ford]]. They married in Milwaukee in 1949.

Their hits included "[[How High the Moon]]", "[[Bye Bye Blues (song)|Bye Bye Blues]]", "Song in Blue", "Don'cha Hear Them Bells", "[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]", and "[[Vaya con Dios (song)|Vaya con Dios]]". The songs were recorded with multiple tracks where Ford harmonized with herself and Paul played multiple layers of guitars.

They used the recording technique known as [[close miking]]<ref name=Garage/> where the microphone is less than {{convert|6|in|cm|0}} from the singer's mouth. This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when a singer is {{convert|1|ft|cm|-1}} or more from the microphone. When using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice due to the microphone's [[Proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]] and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard. The result is a singing style which diverged from the unamplified theater style of the musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.

They also performed music-hall style semi-comic routines with Mary mimicking whatever line Les decided to improvise.<ref>{{Citation|title=Les Paul & Mary Ford Absolutely Live|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awjTKeS9Wvo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/awjTKeS9Wvo| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|date=June 27, 2014|language=en|access-date=2021-08-11}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Radio and television programs===
Paul hosted a 15-minute radio program, ''The Les Paul Show'', on [[NBC Radio]] in 1950, featuring his trio (himself, Ford and rhythm player Eddie Stapleton) and his electronics. The program was recorded from their home and with gentle humor between Paul and Ford bridging musical selections, some of which had already been successful on records, some of which anticipated the couple's recordings, and many of which presented re-interpretations of such jazz and pop selections as "[[In the Mood]]", "Little Rock Getaway", "Brazil", and "[[Tiger Rag]]". Many of these shows survive and are available from various sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/TheLesPaulShow |title=The Les Paul Show |access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629051309/http://www.archive.org/details/TheLesPaulShow |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

When Paul used magnetic tape, he could take his recording equipment on tour, making episodes for his fifteen-minute radio show in a hotel room.

The show appeared on television a few years later with the same format, but excluding the trio and retitled ''Les Paul & Mary Ford at Home'' with "Vaya Con Dios" as the [[Theme music|theme song]]. Sponsored by [[Warner–Lambert]]'s [[Listerine]] [[mouthwash]], it was aired on [[NBC television]] during 1954–1955, and then was [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] until 1960. The five-minute show, consisting of the performance of only one or two songs, aired five times a day, five days a week, and therefore was used as a brief interlude or fill-in for programming schedules. Since Paul created the entire show himself, including audio and video, he maintained the original recordings and was in the process of restoring them to current quality standards until his death.<ref name="Cellini">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/lespaul/index.html |title=Les Paul: Invented Here |last=Cellini |first=Joe |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=n.d. |access-date=August 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222032234/http://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/lespaul/index.html |archive-date=February 22, 2009 }}</ref>

During his radio shows, Paul introduced the fictional "{{visible anchor|Les Paulverizer}}" device, which multiplies anything fed into it, such as a guitar sound or a voice. It was Paul's way of explaining how his single guitar could be multiplied to become a group of guitars. The device even became the subject of comedy, with Ford multiplying herself and her [[vacuum cleaner]] with it so she could finish the housework faster. Later, Paul created a real Les Paulverizer that he attached to his guitar. The invention allowed Paul to access pre-recorded layers of songs during live performances so he could replicate his recorded sound on stage.<ref name="Les Paul Foundation5">{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Sue|title=Les Paul Inventor and performer|url=http://www.lespaulfoundation.org/blog/les-paul-inventor-and-performer/#more-2087|publisher=Les Paul Foundation|access-date=February 4, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140204014322/http://www.lespaulfoundation.org/blog/les-paul-inventor-and-performer/#more-2087|archive-date=February 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Later career===
[[File:Les Paul.jpg|thumb|left|Paul in May 2004|201x201px]]
In 1965, Paul went into semi-retirement, although he did return to his studio occasionally. He and Ford had divorced at the end of 1964 after she became tired of touring.<ref name="nytdiv">"[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/18/les-paul-obtains-divorce.html Les Paul Obtains Divorce] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310074024/https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/18/les-paul-obtains-divorce.html |date=March 10, 2018 }}", ''The New York Times'', December 18, 1964.</ref> One of Paul's most recognizable recordings from then through the mid-1970s was an album for [[London Records]]/[[Phase 4 Stereo]], ''Les Paul Now'' (1968), on which he updated some of his earlier hits. Paul played the initial guitar track, and [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]] laid down the additional tracks while Paul engineered in his home studio. He also recorded two albums, ''[[Chester and Lester]]'' (1976) and ''[[Guitar Monsters]]'' (1978), for [[RCA Victor]], comprising a meld of jazz and country improvisation with guitar virtuoso [[Chet Atkins]], backed by some of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s celebrated studio musicians.

In 1969 Paul produced the album ''Poe Through the Glass Prism'' for RCA. The album featured songs based on Edgar Allan Poe's writing by the northeastern Pennsylvania band the Glass Prism. The album produced a single titled "The Raven" that appeared on Billboard's Hot 100.

As years progressed Paul played at slower tempos with a large pick that was easier to hold in his arthritic hand. In 2006, at the age of  90, he won two Grammy Awards at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]] for his album ''Les Paul & Friends: American Made World Played''. He also performed every Monday night at Manhattan's [[Iridium Jazz Club]] with guitarist Lou Pallo, bassist Paul Nowinski (and later, [[Nicki Parrott]]), and guitarist [[Frank Vignola]] and for a few years, pianist [[John Colianni]]. Paul, Pallo and Nowinski also performed at [[Scheffel Hall|Fat Tuesdays]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iridiumjazzclub.com/|title=Iridium Jazz Club|publisher=Iridium Jazz Club|access-date=March 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305204105/http://iridiumjazzclub.com/|archive-date=March 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Milicia">{{cite web |last1=Milicia |first1=Joe |title=Guitar hero Les Paul ready for Rock Hall tribute |url=https://tucson.com/news/guitar-hero-les-paul-ready-for-rock-hall-tribute/article_c6063d6c-83c7-5add-bff2-e7b10ab8bacb.html |website=Arizona Daily Star |access-date=28 July 2018 |date=7 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221408/https://tucson.com/news/guitar-hero-les-paul-ready-for-rock-hall-tribute/article_c6063d6c-83c7-5add-bff2-e7b10ab8bacb.html |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Foster, D.R.

'''Melvin Huston McDaniel''' (September 6, 1942 – March 31, 2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusicsover.com/2011/03/31/mel-mcdaniel/|title=» Died On This Date (March 31, 2011) Mel McDaniel / Country Music Star |website=Themusicsover.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref> was an American [[country music]] artist. Many of his top hits were released in the 1980s, including "[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]", "[[Big Ole Brew]]", "[[Stand Up (Mel McDaniel song)|Stand Up]]", "[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]" (which reached number one on the country chart), "[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]", "[[Stand on It (Bruce Springsteen song)|Stand on It]]", and a remake of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Let It Roll (Let It Rock)]]".

McDaniel's type of country music has been referred to as "the quintessential happy song" in comparison to other country artists who discuss broken hearts and lost loves. When asked why most of his songs were positive in their outlook, McDaniel told the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' that "there's enough things in the world to keep you bummed out" and that his fans did not want to "hear me singing something that's gonna bum 'em out some more."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tIIgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2818,1429291&dq=mel+mcdaniel+real+good+feel+good+song&hl=en|title=Good Ol' Boy|last=Perala|first=Andrew|date=October 19, 1989|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|access-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
McDaniel was born in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]],<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=249}}</ref> a small town in [[McIntosh County, Oklahoma]], and grew up in [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]]. He was inspired to play music after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] on television. His first interest in music was when he learned the trumpet in the fourth grade, but he soon learned the guitar.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> At age 14, he taught himself the guitar chords to "[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]" and performed at a high-school talent contest. He made his professional debut at age 15 performing in a talent contest at Okmulgee High School. While in high school, he played in several local bands, and after graduation, began working as a musician in [[Tulsa]] clubs. While in Tulsa, he recorded several singles for local label [[J.J. Cale]] and wrote and produced his first single, "Lazy Me".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

===Career===
After marrying his high school sweetheart, McDaniel began performing in Tulsa. From there, he had an unsuccessful trip to Nashville, followed by quite a bit of success in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], performing at clubs among the oil fields.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After two years there, he returned to Nashville and landed a job as a demo singer and songwriter with Combine Music. With the help of music publisher [[Bob Beckham]], McDaniel signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1976 and released his first single, "Have a Dream on Me".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

His career finally took off with "[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]" in 1981, and in early 1985 he scored his only number one hit with "[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Other Top 10 hits include "[[Right in the Palm of Your Hand]]" (later covered by [[Alan Jackson]] in 1999), "[[Take Me to the Country (song)|Take Me to the Country]]", "[[Big Ole Brew]]", "[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]", and "[[Real Good Feel Good Song]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

McDaniel became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on January 11, 1986, and made frequent appearances on the show.

McDaniel was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, along with induction classmate [[Leon Russell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |title=By Year |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194034/http://www.oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>

===Later years, health, and death===

Charles was born on September 23, 1930, in [[Albany, Georgia]].{{efn|name="name"}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raycharles.com/the_man_biography.html|website=raycharles.com |title=Biography |access-date=September 22, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012222755/http://www.raycharles.com/the_man_biography.html |archive-date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> He was the son of Bailey Robinson, a laborer, and Aretha (or Reatha) Robinson (née Williams), a laundress, of [[Greenville, Florida]].

During Aretha's childhood, her mother died. Her father could not keep her. Bailey, a man her father worked with, took her in. The Robinson family—Bailey, his wife Mary Jane, and his mother— informally adopted her and Aretha took the surname Robinson. A few years later Aretha became pregnant by Bailey. During the ensuing scandal, she left Greenville late in the summer of 1930 to be with family back in Albany. After the birth of the child, Ray Charles, she and the infant Charles returned to Greenville. Aretha and Bailey's wife, who had lost a son, then shared in Charles' upbringing. The father had left Greenville and married another woman elsewhere. By his first birthday, Charles had a brother, George.<ref name=Autobio/>

Charles was deeply devoted to his mother and later recalled, despite her poor health and adversity, her perseverance, self-sufficiency, and pride as guiding lights in his life.

In his early years, Charles showed an interest in mechanical objects and often watched his neighbors working on their cars and farm machinery. His musical curiosity was sparked at Wylie Pitman's Red Wing Cafe, at the age of three, when Pitman played [[boogie woogie]] on an old [[upright piano]]; Pitman subsequently taught Charles how to play the piano. Charles and his mother were always welcome at the Red Wing Cafe and even lived there when they were in financial distress.<ref name=Autobio/> Pitman also cared for Ray's younger brother George, to take some of the burden off their mother. George accidentally drowned in his mother's laundry tub when he was four years old.<ref name=Autobio/><ref name="SwingMusicBio">{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Jeff |title=Ray Charles Biography |url=http://www.swingmusic.net/Ray_Charles_Biography.html |website=Swingmusic.net |access-date=December 16, 2018 |archive-date=June 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614172253/http://www.swingmusic.net/Ray_Charles_Biography.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Despite his initial protest, Charles attended school at the [[Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] from 1937 to 1945.<ref name=Autobio/>

Charles further developed his musical talent at school<ref name= boheme/> and was taught to play the [[classical music|classical]] piano music of [[J.S. Bach|Bach]], [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]]. His teacher, Mrs. Lawrence, taught him how to use [[braille music]], a difficult process that requires learning the left hand movements by reading braille with the right hand and learning the right hand movements by reading braille with the left hand,  then combining the two parts.

Charles' mother died in the spring of 1945, when he was 14. Her death came as a shock to him; he later said the deaths of his brother and mother were "the two great tragedies" of his life. Charles decided not to return to school after the funeral.<ref name=Autobio/>

In 1947, Charles moved to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], where he held two jobs, including one as a pianist for Charles Brantley's Honey Dippers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabaymusichistory.com/charlie-brantley-and-his-original-honey-dippers.php|title=Charlie Brantley and His Original Honey Dippers|publisher=Tampabaymusichistory.com|access-date=January 16, 2017|archive-date=October 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008090312/http://www.tampabaymusichistory.com/charlie-brantley-and-his-original-honey-dippers.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

In his early career, Charles modeled himself on [[Nat King Cole]].

Charles had always played piano for other people, but he was keen to have his own band. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, and, considering Chicago and New York City too big, followed his friend Gossie McKee to [[Seattle]], Washington, in March 1948, knowing that the biggest radio hits came from northern cities.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead"/><ref name="boheme2">{{cite news|title=Charles, Ray (1930–2004)|publisher=HistoryLink.org|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5707|access-date=May 12, 2007|archive-date=October 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031074822/http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5707|url-status=live}}</ref> There he met and befriended, under the tutelage of [[Robert Blackwell]], the 15-year-old [[Quincy Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon0bio-1|title=Quincy Jones Biography|publisher=Achievement.org|access-date=December 22, 2014  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926221424/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon0bio-1|archive-date=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

With Charles on piano, McKee on guitar, and Milton Garred on bass, ''The McSon Trio'' (named for '''''Mc'''''Kee and Robin'''''son''''') started playing the 1–5 A.M. shift at the Rocking Chair.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ray Charles: "I was Born with Music Inside Me"|first=Carin T.|last=Ford|publisher=Enslow Publishers, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7660-2701-5|url=https://archive.org/details/raycharlesiwasbo00ford/page/8}}</ref> Publicity photos of this trio are some of the earliest known photographs of Charles.

In 1950, Charles' performance in a Miami hotel impressed [[Henry Stone]], who went on to record a Ray Charles Rockin' record, which did not achieve popularity. During his stay in Miami, Charles was required to stay in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] but thriving black community of [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]].

After signing with [[Swing Time Records]], Charles recorded two more R&B hits under the name Ray Charles: "Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand" (1951), which reached No. 5, and "Kissa Me Baby" (1952), which reached No. 8. Swing Time folded the following year, and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] signed Charles to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]].<ref name=boheme/>

In addition to being a musician, Charles was also a record producer, producing [[Guitar Slim]]'s number 1 hit, "[[The Things That I Used to Do]]".

[[File:Aankomst Ray Charles (kop) op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 921-7410.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles in 1968]]
In June 1952, Atlantic bought Charles' contract for $2,500 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1952}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-story-of-atlantic-records-20010426 |title=The Story of Atlantic Records: Ahmet Ertegun in His Own Words |last=Fricke |first=David |date=April 26, 2001 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 3, 2018 |archive-date=April 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404073740/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-story-of-atlantic-records-20010426 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=[[Rockin' in Time]]|last=Szatmary|first=David P.|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|page=177}}</ref> His first recording session for Atlantic ("The Midnight Hour"/"Roll with My Baby") took place in September 1952, although his last Swing Time release ("Misery in My Heart"/"The Snow Is Falling") would not appear until February 1953.

In 1953, "[[Mess Around]]" became his first small hit for Atlantic; during the next year, he had hits with "[[It Should've Been Me (Memphis Curtis song)|It Should've Been Me]]" and "Don't You Know".<ref name=":0"/> He also recorded the songs "Midnight Hour" and "Sinner's Prayer" around this time.

Late in 1954, Charles recorded "[[I've Got a Woman]]". The lyrics were written by bandleader Renald Richard. Charles claimed the composition. They later admitted that the song went back to [[the Southern Tones]]' "It Must Be Jesus" (1954). It became one of his most notable hits, reaching No. 2 on the R&B chart.<ref name=":0"/> "I've Got a Woman" combined [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz]], and [[blues]] elements. In 1955, he had hits with "[[This Little Girl of Mine]]" and "[[A Fool for You]]". In upcoming years, hits included "[[Drown in My Own Tears]]" and "[[Hallelujah I Love Her So]]".

Charles also recorded jazz, such as ''[[The Great Ray Charles]]'' (1957). He worked with vibraphonist [[Milt Jackson]], releasing ''[[Soul Brothers]]'' in 1958 and ''[[Soul Meeting]]'' in 1961. By 1958, he was not only headlining major black venues such as the [[The Apollo Theater|Apollo Theater]] in New York, but also larger venues such as [[Carnegie Hall]] and the [[The Newport Jazz Festival|Newport Jazz Festival]], where his first live album was recorded in 1958. He hired a female singing group, [[the Cookies]], and renamed them [[the Raelettes]]. In 1958, Charles and the Raelettes performed for the famed [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] concert produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]] held at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] on August 3. The other headliners were [[Little Willie John]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ernie Freeman]], and [[Bo Rhambo]]. [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] was also there to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dreamboogietrium00gura|title=Dream boogie: the triumph of Sam Cooke|last=Guralnick, Peter.|date=2005|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=0-316-37794-5|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=57393650}}</ref><ref>"Applause!

Charles reached the pinnacle of his success at Atlantic with the release of "What'd I Say", which combined gospel, jazz, blues and Latin music. Charles said he wrote it spontaneously while he was performing in clubs with his band. Despite some radio stations banning the song because of its sexually suggestive lyrics, the song became Charles' first top-ten pop record. It reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' Pop chart and No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart in 1959.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":0"/> Later that year, he released his first country song (a cover of [[Hank Snow]]'s "[[I'm Moving On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]") and recorded three more albums for the label: a jazz record (''The Genius After Hours'', 1961); a blues record (''The Genius Sings the Blues'', 1961); and a big band record (''The Genius of Ray Charles'', 1959) which was his first Top 40 album, peaking at No. 17.

Charles earned another Grammy for the follow-up track "[[Hit the Road Jack]]", written by R&B singer [[Percy Mayfield]].

By late 1961, Charles had expanded his small road ensemble to a [[big band]], partly as a response to increasing royalties and touring fees, becoming one of the few black artists to cross over into mainstream pop with such a level of creative control.<ref name="times"/><ref name=cooper20>Cooper (1998), pp. 20–22.</ref> This success, however, came to a momentary halt during a concert tour in November 1961, when a police search of Charles' hotel room in Indianapolis, Indiana, led to the discovery of heroin in the medicine cabinet. The case was eventually dropped, as the search lacked a proper [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] by the police, and Charles soon returned to music.<ref name=cooper20/>

In the early 1960s, on the way from Louisiana to [[Oklahoma City]], Charles faced a near-death experience when the pilot of his plane lost visibility, as snow and his failure to use the defroster caused the windshield of the plane to become completely covered in ice. The pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane. Charles placed a spiritual interpretation on the experience, claiming that "something or someone which instruments cannot detect" was responsible for creating the small opening in the ice on the windshield which enabled the pilot to eventually land the plane safely.<ref name=Autobio/>

The 1962 album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv3-83.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=May 24, 2022|archive-date=August 9, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220809112847/https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv3-83.php|url-status=live}}</ref> and its sequel, ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music Volume Two|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2]]'', helped to bring [[country music]] into the musical mainstream. Charles' version of the [[Don Gibson]] song "[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]" topped the Pop chart for five weeks, stayed at No. 1 on the R&B chart for ten weeks, and gave him his only number-one record in the UK.

In 1964, Charles' career was halted once more after he was arrested for a third time for possession of heroin.<ref name=":8" /> He agreed to go to a rehabilitative facility to avoid jail time and eventually kicked his habit at a clinic in Los Angeles. After spending a year on parole, Charles reappeared in the charts in 1966 with a series of hits composed with [[Ashford & Simpson]] and [[Jo Armstead]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-brill-building-broadway-and-beyond-r-b-and-soul-singer-songwriter-joshie-armstead-2495380930.html|title=The Brill Building, Broadway, and Beyond: R&B and Soul Singer-songwriter Joshie Armstead|last=Wikane|first=Christian John|date=September 11, 2017|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020|archive-date=April 7, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407185601/https://www.popmatters.com/the-brill-building-broadway-and-beyond-r-b-and-soul-singer-songwriter-joshie-armstead-2495380930.html|url-status=live}}</ref> including the dance number "[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]" and "[[Let's Go Get Stoned]]", which became his first number-one R&B hit in several years.

Charles' renewed chart success, however, proved to be short lived, and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations. The rise of [[psychedelic rock]] and harder forms of rock and R&B music had reduced Charles' radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his master tapes had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: either adored or panned by fans and critics alike.<ref name="boheme"/> His recordings during this period, especially 1972's ''[[A Message from the People]]'', moved toward the [[progressive soul]] sound popular at the time.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Swenson|editor-first=John|year=1999|title=The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=978-0-679-76873-9|page=138}}</ref> ''A Message from the People'' included his unique gospel-influenced version of "[[America the Beautiful]]" and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of "America the Beautiful" because it was very drastically changed from the song's original version. On July 14, 1973, [[Margie Hendrix]], the mother of Ray's son Charles Wayne Hendrix, died at 38 years old, which led to Ray having to care for the child. The official cause of her death is unknown.

In 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit "[[Living for the City]]" later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album ''[[True to Life (Ray Charles album)|True to Life]]'', remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as [[Aretha Franklin]], were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|title=Ray Charles|publisher=SnlTranscripts.jt.org|date=November 12, 1977|access-date=September 10, 2010|archive-date=April 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406222235/https://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1979, his version of "Georgia on My Mind" was proclaimed the [[state song]] of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature. In 1980 Charles performed in the musical film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''.<ref name="boheme"/> Although he had notably supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort in South Africa in 1981 during an international boycott protesting that country's [[apartheid]] policy. He later defended his choice of performing there, insisting that the audience of black and white fans would integrate while he was there.<ref name="boheme"/>

===1983–2004: Later years===
In 1983, Charles signed a contract with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. He recorded a string of country albums and had hit singles in duets with singers such as [[George Jones]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[Mickey Gilley]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] ("Precious Thing") and his longtime friend [[Willie Nelson]], with whom he recorded "[[Seven Spanish Angels]]".

In 1985, Charles participated in the musical recording and video "[[We Are the World]]", a charity single recorded by the supergroup United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa.[[File:Ray Charles FIJM 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles at the 2003 [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], one of his last public performances]]

In 1990 he participated for the first time in the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] with song ''[[Good Love Gone Bad]]'', written by [[Toto Cutugno]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznHGPwwt9Q|title=Ray Charles - Good love gone bad (Gli amori - Toto Cutugno)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=November 7, 2022 |access-date=July 25, 2023|archive-date=July 25, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725153645/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznHGPwwt9Q|url-status=live}}</ref>

Before the release of his first album for Warner, ''Would You Believe'', Charles made a return to the R&B charts with a cover of the [[The Brothers Johnson|Brothers Johnson]]'s "[[I'll Be Good to You]]", a duet with his lifelong friend Quincy Jones and the singer [[Chaka Khan]], which hit number one on the R&B chart in 1990 and won Charles and Khan a Grammy for their duet. Prior to this, Charles returned to the pop charts with "[[Baby Grand]]", a duet with singer-songwriter [[Billy Joel]]. In 1989, he recorded a cover of the [[Southern All Stars]]' "Itoshi no Ellie" for a Japanese TV advertisement for the [[Suntory]] brand, releasing it in Japan as "Ellie My Love", where it reached No.{{nbsp}}3 on its [[Oricon]] chart.<ref name="oricon89">{{cite web|url=http://www2.wbs.ne.jp/~ms-db/oricon/oricon_single_89.htm |title=List of Best-Selling International Singles in Japan of 1989 |publisher=Oricon.

In 2001–02, Charles appeared in commercials for the [[New Jersey Lottery]] to promote its campaign "For every dream, there's a jackpot."

In 2003, he headlined the [[White House Correspondents' Association#White House Correspondents' dinner|White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] in Washington, D.C., attended by President [[George W.

Also in 2003, Charles presented [[Van Morrison]] with Morrison's award upon being inducted in the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and the two sang Morrison's song "[[Crazy Love (Van Morrison song)|Crazy Love]]" (the performance appears on Morrison's 2007 album ''[[The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3]]''). In 2003, Charles performed "Georgia on My Mind" and "America the Beautiful" at a televised annual banquet of electronic media journalists held in Washington, D.C. His final public appearance was on April 30, 2004, at the dedication of his music studio as a historic landmark in Los Angeles.<ref name="boheme" />

==Legacy==
===Influence on music industry===
Charles possessed one of the most recognizable voices in American music. In the words of musicologist [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]]:

{{blockquote|Sinatra, and Bing Crosby before him, had been masters of words. Ray Charles is a master of sounds. His records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams and hollers, all wonderfully controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and rhythm... It is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can't tell it to you. He can't even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair—or exaltation. The voice alone, with little assistance from the text or the notated music, conveys the message.<ref>{{cite book|first= Henry|last= Pleasants|author-link= Henry Pleasants (music critic)|date= 1974|title= The Great American Popular Singers|publisher= Simon and Schuster|location= New York City|isbn= 978-0-671-21681-8|url= https://archive.org/details/greatamericanpop00pleas}}</ref>}}

Pleasants continues, "Ray Charles is usually described as a baritone, and his speaking voice would suggest as much, as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritone's high E and F in a popular ballad. But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even C sharp and D, sometimes in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in falsetto.

===Contribution to civil rights movement===
On March 15, 1961, shortly after the release of the hit song "Georgia on My Mind" (1960), the [[Albany, Georgia]]-born musician was scheduled to perform at a dance at Bell Auditorium in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], but cancelled the show after learning from students of [[Paine College]] that the larger auditorium dance floor was restricted to whites, while blacks would be obliged to sit in the Music Hall balcony. Charles left town immediately after letting the public know why he would not be performing, but the promoter went on to sue Charles for breach of contract, and Charles was fined $757 in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta on June 14, 1962. The following year, Charles did perform at a desegregated Bell Auditorium concert together with his backup singers, [[the Raelettes]], on October 23, 1963, as depicted in the 2004 film, ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]''.<ref>{{cite web|work=augustaciviccenter.com|url=http://augustaciviccenter.com/auditorium.html|title=William B.

Charles was married twice. His first marriage lasted less than a year; his second lasted 22 years. Throughout his life, Charles had many relationships with women with whom he fathered a dozen children.

His first marriage to Eileen Williams lasted from July 31, 1951, until 1952.

He met his second wife Della Beatrice Howard Robinson (called "Bea" by Charles) in Texas in 1954. They married the following year on April 5, 1955. Their first child together, Ray Charles Robinson Jr., was born in 1955. Charles was not in town for the birth because he was playing a show in Texas. The couple had two more sons, David and Robert. They raised their children in [[View Park–Windsor Hills, California|View Park, California]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Louie|date=October 1974|title=The Enduring Genius of Ray Charles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JN4DAAAAMBAJ&q=view+park&pg=PA125|journal=Ebony|page=125|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=May 8, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508045413/https://books.google.com/books?id=JN4DAAAAMBAJ&q=view+park&pg=PA125#v=snippet&q=view%20park&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> Charles felt that his heroin addiction took a toll on Della during their marriage.<ref name="Autobio" /> Due to his drug addiction, extramarital affairs on tours and volatile behavior, the marriage deteriorated and she filed for divorce in 1977 and it was finalized after 22 years of marriage.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswirl.com/della-beatrice-howard-robinson/|title=Della Beatrice Howard Robinson|date=December 30, 2017|website=NewSwirl|language=en-US|access-date=November 18, 2019|archive-date=June 26, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220626085007/https://www.newswirl.com/della-beatrice-howard-robinson/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Charles had a six-year-long affair with [[Margie Hendrix]], one of the original Raelettes, and in 1959 they had a son, Charles Wayne. His affair with Mae Mosley Lyles resulted in a daughter, Renee, born in 1961. In 1963, Charles had another daughter, this one by Sandra Jean Betts, named  Sheila Raye Charles. Sheila Raye, like her father, was a singer/songwriter; she died of breast cancer on June 15, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lasentinel.net/ray-charles-daughter-sheila-raye-charles-succumbs-to-breast-cancer.html|title=Ray Charles' Daughter Sheila Raye Charles Succumbs to Breast Cancer|date=June 22, 2017|access-date=March 4, 2023|archive-date=March 4, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230304185349/https://lasentinel.net/ray-charles-daughter-sheila-raye-charles-succumbs-to-breast-cancer.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1977, Charles had a child with his Parisian lover Arlette Kotchounian whom he met in 1967.<ref name=":3">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5v1pSAHAEa0C&pg=PP1|title=Ray Charles: Birth of Soul|last=Evans|first=Mike|date=2009|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=978-0-85712-051-9|location=London|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=May 8, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508045331/https://books.google.com/books?id=5v1pSAHAEa0C&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> His long-term girlfriend and partner at the time of his death was Norma Pinella.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSGhEUq5bp0C&q=norma+pinella+ray+charles&pg=PA176|title=Icons of Black America: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries [3 volumes]: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries [Three Volumes]|last=Whitaker|first=Matthew|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=176|year=2011|isbn=978-0-313-37643-6|language=en|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=May 8, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508045558/https://books.google.com/books?id=RSGhEUq5bp0C&q=norma+pinella+ray+charles&pg=PA176|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Drug abuse and legal problems===
At 18, Charles first tried [[marijuana]] when he played in McSon Trio and was eager to try it as he thought it helped musicians create music and tap into their [[creativity]]. He later became addicted to [[heroin]] for seventeen years.<ref name=":7" /> Charles was first arrested in 1955, when he and his bandmates were caught backstage with loose marijuana and drug paraphernalia, including a burnt spoon, syringe, and needle. The arrest did not deter his drug use, which only escalated as he became more successful and made more money.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead" />

In 1958, Charles was arrested on a [[Harlem]] street corner for possession of narcotics and equipment for administering heroin.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=December 4, 1958|title=Singer Ray Charles Jailed on Dope Charge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0EDAAAAMBAJ&q=ray+charles+arrested+jet+1958&pg=PA57|magazine=Jet|volume=15|issue=5|page=57|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=May 8, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508045332/https://books.google.com/books?id=f0EDAAAAMBAJ&q=ray+charles+arrested+jet+1958&pg=PA57#v=snippet&q=ray%20charles%20arrested%20jet%201958&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

Charles responded to the saga of his drug use and reform with the songs "[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]" and "[[Let's Go Get Stoned]]" and the release of ''[[Crying Time (album)|Crying Time]]'', his first album since kicking his heroin addiction in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blackdoctor.org/272450/ray-charles-drug-addiction__trashed/ |title=Ray Charles: Lessons From His Life & Death |website=BlackDoctor.org |access-date=March 16, 2017 |archive-date=April 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403023009/https://blackdoctor.org/272450/ray-charles-drug-addiction__trashed/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/ray-charles-about-ray-charles/554/|title= About Ray Charles|website= PBS.org|date= May 17, 2006|access-date= March 16, 2017|archive-date= June 9, 2023|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230609155005/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/ray-charles-about-ray-charles/554/|url-status= live}}</ref>

===Chess hobby===
Charles enjoyed playing chess.

==Death==
In 2003, Charles had successful hip replacement surgery and was planning to go back on tour, until he began having other ailments.

==Discography==
{{main|Ray Charles discography}}
Charles' discography is highly complex and extensive. [[AllMusic]] has listed approximately 60 original albums and more than 200 compilation albums, while music essayist [[Robert Christgau]] noted the existence of more. At least 20 record labels have released near-identical compilations of Charles' pre-[[Atlantic Records]] tracks, while many of the [[mastering (audio)|masters]] that Charles began to own after 1960 were not digitally reissued, leading the Atlantic sister label [[Rhino Entertainment]] to focus on rereleasing his mid-to-late 1950s music. Christgau has called Charles' discography a "monumental mess" and that "any map of his oeuvre must be personal and provisional".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=July 8, 2004|title=The Genius at Work: Ray Charles, A Critical Discography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=July 24, 2021|via=robertchristgau.com|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/charles-rs.php|archive-date=June 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613164806/https://robertchristgau.com/xg/music/charles-rs.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

The song also did well in Australia, stopping at #9 on its chart.<ref name="AMG"/> The song would later be recorded by [[Elvis Presley]], with whom Peterson became friends. Peterson scored a [[Top 40|Top 10]] hit with the [[teenage tragedy song]], "[[Tell Laura I Love Her]]".<ref>#7 on June 27, 1960</ref> In the UK, [[Decca Records]] made the decision not to release the latter recording on the grounds that it was "too tasteless and vulgar," and destroyed about twenty thousand copies that had already been pressed.

In 1960, Peterson created his own [[record label]] with his [[management|manager]] Stan Shulman, called Dunes Records, and enlisted the help of [[record producer]] [[Phil Spector]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/RayPeterson1.html|title=RAB Hall of Fame: Ray Peterson|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=4 December 2017|archive-date=15 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115174136/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/RayPeterson1.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> with "[[Corrine, Corrina]]".<ref name="Guardian"/><ref>#9 on December 19, 1960; produced by Spector; cover of a 1931 [[Red Nichols]] hit</ref> Peterson's dramatic [[ballad]], "I Could Have Loved You So Well", [[songwriter|written]] by [[Barry Mann]] and [[Gerry Goffin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mann-weil.com/music_discography.php?s=ghi#72|title=Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil - Official Website - Music - Discography|website=Mann-weil.com|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref> and produced by Spector,{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} only reached #57 on the U.S. chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Ray Peterson.

(The later song was covered by [[the Shangri-Las]] five years later and became a Top 30 hit.)

His last charting US-Top-30 hit was "[[Missing You (Red Sovine song)|Missing You]]".<ref>#29 on June 29, 1961</ref> By the mid-1960s he had become something of a phenomenon on the west coast of the United States, appearing live in numerous [[concert]]s with Keith Allison.

His performances at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium, produced by [[Fred Vail]], beginning in 1963 helped fuel a revival of "The Wonder of You", as well as launching his new relationship with [[MGM Records]], an alliance that produced two [[albums]]: ''The Very Best of Ray Peterson'' which featured most of the Dunes singles, and ''The Other Side of Ray Peterson,'' which included many of his [[nightclub]] songs. He later moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], and by the 1970s when the hit records stopped coming, Peterson became a [[Baptist Church]] [[religious minister|minister]] and occasionally played the classic hits music circuit. In 1981 he released a Christian folk rock album called ''Highest Flight'', which was also released as ''My Father's Place''.

Peterson was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Peterson died of colon cancer on January 25, 2005, in [[Smyrna, Tennessee]], aged 69.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p11407/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Jason Ankeny |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 29, 2009}}</ref> He left a [[widow]], four sons, and three daughters.<ref name="Guardian"/> For publicity reasons, he had shaved four years off his age, leading many sources to list his age as 65. He was interred in the Roselawn Memorial Gardens cemetery in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].

==The college years & independent recordings==

===''Velveteen'' (1996 - 1998), ''Image Trigger'' (1998 - 2000)===
[[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] (5/15/76 – present) formed the band while in school at Ohio University. Originally from New Jersey, he formed Red Wanting Blue in the fall of 1995. In 1996 Red Wanting Blue released their first full-length album titled ''Velveteen''.  While still in college in 1998, the band went on to release their second full-length album ''The Image Trigger''.

===''Model Citizen'' (2000–2001)===
''Model Citizen'' was RWB's third studio release and arguably their breakthrough album. It was the first album with current bassist, Mark McCullough. After the release of ''Model Citizen'', Red Wanting Blue started gaining media attention for their rapidly growing grassroots following. The original version of the song ''Audition'' was recorded for this album. The song was picked up nationally by [[Abercrombie and Fitch]] and placed on rotation at their stores throughout the US. ''Audition'' was later re-vamped and re-recorded for the 2011 album ''From the Vanishing Point'' and found success on the radio and television in 2012 and 2013.

===''Sirens'' (2001–2002)===
''Sirens'' is Red Wanting Blue's fourth studio release. The band would eventually dedicate ''Sirens'' to those lives lost during the [[September 11 attacks]]. Red Wanting Blue toured to support ''Sirens'' by headlining small rock clubs across the US.

===''Souvenirs of City Life'' (2002–2003)===
''Souvenirs of City Life'' is the band's fifth studio release. ''Souvenirs of City Life'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on [[Aware Records]] online store – awarestore.com. Red Wanting Blue toured extensively during this time period headlining rock clubs and also touring alongside longtime friends [[O.A.R.

''Pride: The Cold Lover'' again debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on Awarestore ([[Aware Records]] online store) and several songs were placed on the [[CBS]]/[[VH1]] program, Love Monkey as well as [[the CW]] hit show Life is Wild.<ref name="alternativeaddiction.com">{{Cite web |url= http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/1139/Red-Wanting-Blue-Ready-New-Album |website= AlternativeAddiction.com |author=Chad |title= Red Wanting Blue Ready New Album |publisher= Alternative Addiction |date= 10 August 2008}}</ref>  Around this time period it was brought to the band's attention that hundreds of fans across the US tattooed Red Wanting Blue's symbol (an angel/devil sign – penned by [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] in 1995) on their bodies. Honored, the band thanked those fans in the liner notes of this album. RWB picked up an additional member, guitarist, keyboardist and back-up vocalist Greg Rahm. RWB independently set out on a large tour (headlining venues from mid-level clubs to small theaters) stretching from New York to California. Songs from this album found themselves on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. During this time RWB was featured as an unsigned band to watch on Demodiaries.com, Kings of A&R and Hits Magazine. 

===''The Warehouse Sessions'' (2006–2008)===
''The Warehouse Sessions'' is a live album/DVD recorded in the band's warehouse and studio space in front of 100 of RWB biggest fans from across the country. Tickets to this intimate event sold out in under two minutes. ''The Warehouse Sessions'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on Awarestore.com ([[Aware Records]] online store) in its first week of pre-sale. It was made to bridge the gap between ''Pride: The Cold Lover'' and 2008's ''These Magnificent Miles''. This album/DVD featured early acoustic versions of fan favorites "You Are My Las Vegas" and "Finger in the Air" from ''These Magnificent Miles''.

===''These Magnificent Miles'' (2008–2010)===
[[File:Centennial Concert (4268332410).jpg|thumb|Performing at [[Anderson Arena]] in 2010.]]
The band enlisted Grammy nominated producer Jamie Candiloro ([[Ryan Adams]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Willie Nelson]]) for ''These Magnificent Miles''. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] is quoted as saying that this album was inspired by "the circus life of a band on the road." Current guitarist Eric Hall began his career with Red Wanting Blue during this time period. The band settled into an Americana rock ‘n’ roll vibe utilizing more melodic sounds than that of their prior work. Drummer Dean Anshutz joined the band toward the end of this album cycle.

After signing with Fanatic Records in April 2010, ''These Magnificent Miles'' was re-released nationally on July 27, 2010, for a wider audience. Fanatic also issued a deluxe double-LP edition of ''These Magnificent Miles'' with full-color LP sleeves featuring the art of John Terry ([[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]]'s brother). In September 2010, the single "Where You Wanna Go" was heard on radio stations across the country. An eccentric music video was released for "Where You Wanna Go" featuring the band finding themselves trapped in an Alice in Wonderland type setting. Red Wanting Blue settled into a rhythm on tour of nearly selling out venues in advance (large rock clubs and mid-sized theaters), most shows during this time period selling out by day of show. The band's following in major cities like NYC started doubling in size with each live concert.

Red Wanting Blue was commissioned to write a song for the film "Unraveled". The song called "Magic Man" was released as a single and is played in its entirety during the film. The documentary "These Magnificent Miles – On the Long Road with Red Wanting Blue" was released in April 2011. The band does not sell or support the documentary. On April 13, 2011, lead singer [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was the guest star on [[NPR]] Radio's Snap Judgement and told a story about the band traveling through Yellowstone National Park and running into "trouble". In June 2011 Red Wanting Blue was presented with the Key to the City from the mayor of Kearney, Nebraska.

===''From The Vanishing Point'' (2011–2014)===

In early 2011, the band headed into the studio to begin recording their second official label release (RWB's 9th album). Once again, the band enlisted the talents of Jamie Candiloro to produce the album. The title of the album was released on August 5, 2011, through social media outlets. ''From the Vanishing Point'' was originally slated for release in the fall of 2011, but the album release was pushed back to January 2012.<ref name="PittPost Gazette06072012" /> In the weeks before its release ''From the Vanishing Point'' was streamed over 80,000 times in the month of October alone. Over 150,000 streams of the album were recorded by the turn of 2012. "From the Vanishing Point" landed at ''#10 on The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart'' in its first official week of release.<ref name="Heatseekers 2012" /> The singles "Audition," "Stay on the Bright Side" and "White Snow" were released on [[Adult Album Alternative]] radio also known as AAAradio or Triple-A. The music video for "Audition" was shot live, in one-take on October 13 at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, OH. The intention was to introduce the authentic live energy of the band without including the "Hollywood magic" that is involved in most "live-style" music videos. In November 2011, Red Wanting Blue along with producer Jamie Candiloro headed back into the studio to record "[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]" as a holiday treat for their fans. The song found its way to the radio and was picked up as a holiday single. Music Choice Television also picked up the song as a holiday single.<ref name="music choice">[http://www.rtbot.net/fanatic_records Fanatic Records Information, Videos, Pictures and News.]</ref>

RWB's album release tour kicked off in January 2012 and consisted of several months of sold-out shows from Chicago to New York City and more. This time proved to be the band's most successful period of touring to date with concerts selling out weeks in advance. In the morning, before most tour stops, the band could be heard making special appearances on the local radio stations (most included an interview and two to three songs). Red Wanting Blue also performed on [[The Rock Boat]] in March as well as several shows with friends and fellow musicians [[Carbon Leaf]]. On June 29, 2012 RWB's live concert attendance record was broken in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Over 9,000 people attended the outdoor concert dubbed "Red Wanting Blue - Rocking on the River" in support of the band. On April 13, "Unraveled", the film that features RWB's "Magic Man", was released theatrically (later debuting on [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] on August 8.) On July 10, the band made available a free download of their concert from NYC venue City Winery.

On July 18, Red Wanting Blue made their network television debut on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]]<ref name="Tribune06072012" /> performing the song "Audition" to an audience that roared and cheered along. On Sept 17th RWB performed their debut session on Daytrotter.com. On October 1, 2012, the band announced they would be performing and appearing live on [[VH1]]'s morning show "Big Morning Buzz Live" on October 16 at 10am alongside [[Bruno Mars]] and [[Jason Aldean]]. On November 5 Red Wanting Blue performed live on the [[NPR]] radio program [[Mountain Stage]] alongside [[Dr. Dog]] and [[The Mountain Goats]] at the Keith Albee Theater in West Virginia.

In early 2013, RWB headlined a tour of the west coast and continued to sell out shows throughout the Midwest and east coast. They also toured eastern Canada with [[The Trews]] and hit a major milestone by selling out [[The Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City. At ''The Bowery Ballroom'' on March 9, Red Wanting Blue announced that they would be heading back into the studio with producer/friend Jamie Candiloro throughout March and April 2013 to record their 10th album.

Throughout March, April and May 2013, Red Wanting Blue returned to their recording studio ("El Rancho Relaxo" in Columbus, Ohio) with Jamie Candiloro to produce their tenth album. This had been the longest amount of time ever scheduled off the road (for the purpose of recording) in the band's career. In September, RWB announced their fall tour dates with longtime friend [[Will Hoge]]. Red Wanting Blue chose [[Swear and Shake]] to open several dates on this fall tour entitled "The Dime Store Circus Tour".

In February 2014 Red Wanting Blue officially sold out their first two-night stint at the House of Blues In Cleveland, Ohio. They performed their "love songs" on the February 14 concert in honor of Valentine's Day and performed their full rock and roll show on February 15. The band played several rare songs from their early albums during these concerts.

On February 22 the band set sail for their 3rd appearance on [[The Rock Boat]]. Red Wanting Blue played on the theatre and pool deck stages. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was invited to perform at the "Campfire Story Sessions" where he performed solo with his ukulele and told the true stories behind the songs  "Probably Nothing", "Jennifear" and a never before performed song called "Little America." Ken Block and Drew Copland (of [[Sister Hazel]]), Emerson Hart (of [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]]) and [[Edwin McCain]] sang harmony on "Jennifear" as Scott Terry expressed several times how honored he was to be in their company.

===''Little America'' (2014 – 2016)===
On July 1, 2014, Red Wanting Blue released their tenth studio album titled ''Little America''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart and No.&nbsp;31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock Chart. The album was recorded in Columbus, Ohio and Los Angeles, California, produced by Jamie Candiloro and mastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound in NYC. Guest appearances include [[Ed Kowalczyk]] (of [[Live (band)]]), Kerri Spieler (of [[Swear and Shake]]) and Tim Hanseroth (of [[Brandi Carlile]]). A music video was released for the single ''You Are My Las Vegas'' starring the band member's real-life mothers. In the video, the moms physically transform into their sons (beards and all) and perform the song in character.

To celebrate the release of ''Little America'', RWB hit the road with longtime friends [[The Alternate Routes]]. The ''Sounds Like Summer U.S. Tour'' started in July 2014. In November, 2014 ''RWB'' hit the road with New Orleans band [[The Revivalists]] for a tour of the east coast and midwest. On Dec 4, 2014, ''Red Wanting Blue'' performed a special concert at [[Trinity Cathedral (Cleveland, Ohio)|Trinity Cathedral]] in Cleveland, Ohio. The performance consisted of both acoustic and electric sets and was recorded for the Cathedral Concert Series for [[PBS]] (rumored to air in March 2015).

In January, 2015, the band set sail to perform on the floating music festival ''Cayamo'' that featured [[John Prine]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[The Lone Bellow]], and more. Directly after ''Cayamo'', the band boarded ''The Rock Boat XV'' for their fourth consecutive year. The band performed alongside hosts [[Sister Hazel]], [[Barenaked Ladies]], longtime friends [[Alternate Routes]], [[Will Hoge]], and more. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] hosted the popular Rock Boat Songwriter Sessions and performed two brand new songs titled "Holy Rolling Thunder" and "No Place To Go But Down".

''RWB'' hit the road in the spring/summer of 2015 on a tour called "Our Little America Tour". The tour began in Northwest Canada and ended in Boston. During this time they shared the stage with friends [[The Trews]] and [[The Alternate Routes]]. They debuted two new songs during this tour titled "High and Dry" and "Holy Rolling Thunder".

===''RWB20 Live at Lincoln Theater'' (since 2016)===

This live concert film was recorded live at the Lincoln Theater in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on October 14, 2016. The double disc ''RWB20'' film and album was released only two months later, on December 16, 2016. The film was directed by ''Jenna Pace'' and the album was produced by ''Greg Rahm''. The film's purpose was to celebrate the first 20 years of ''Red Wanting Blue''. The concert started with a brand new song and proceeded to go back in time, playing re-worked versions of songs dating back to 1996.

'''Eric Hilliard Nelson''' (May 8, 1940 – December 31, 1985) was an American musician and actor. From age eight he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist. 

His fame as both a recording artist and television star also led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in [[Howard Hawks]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] feature film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). He placed 54 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and its predecessors between 1957 and 1973, including "[[Poor Little Fool]]" in 1958, which was the first number one song on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's then-newly created [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 chart]]. He recorded 17 additional top ten hits and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on January 21, 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|1983|p=491}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=284}} In 1996 Nelson was ranked No. 49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref name="fifty" />

Nelson began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet''. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]''. In 1957, he recorded his first single ("I'm Walkin' b/w "A Teenager's Romance", Verve 10047X4S), debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album ''[[Ricky (album)|Ricky]]''. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, "[[Poor Little Fool]]", and in 1959 received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for "Most Promising Male Newcomer" after starring in ''Rio Bravo''. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs. In his twenties, he moved away from the pop music of his youth and began to perform in a [[country rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |title=Rick Nelson Biography |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2022-11-23 |archive-date=November 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124044719/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |url-status=live }}</ref> After recording several albums with mostly [[session musician]]s, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album ''[[In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969]]'' and had a surprise hit with 1972's "[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label. He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade. He released two more albums, with unimpressive results, before [[Death of Ricky Nelson|his death in a plane crash]] on New Year's Eve, 1985.

Nelson was married once, to [[Kristin Nelson|Sharon Kristin Harmon]], from 1963 until their divorce in 1982. They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]], twin sons and musicians [[Gunnar Nelson (musician)|Gunnar]] and [[Matthew Nelson (musician)|Matthew]], and actor Sam.

==Early life==
Nelson was born on May 8, 1940, in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=2, 16–17}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=25}}<ref name="NOTE" /> He was the second son of entertainment couple [[Ozzie Nelson|Ozzie]] and [[Harriet Nelson]]. His father was of half Swedish descent. The Nelsons' older son was actor [[David Nelson (actor)|David Nelson]].

Harriet, normally the vocalist for Ozzie's band, remained in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], with her newborn and toddler. Meanwhile, bandleader Ozzie toured with the Nelson orchestra.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=17}} The Nelsons bought a two-story colonial house in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]],{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=17}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=26}}<ref name="Cotten" /> and six months after the purchase, moved with son David to Hollywood, where Ozzie and Harriet were slated to appear in the 1941–42 season of [[Red Skelton]]'s ''The Raleigh Cigarette Hour;'' Ricky remained in Tenafly in the care of his paternal grandmother.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=18}} In November 1941, the Nelsons bought what would become their permanent home: a green and white, two-story, Cape Cod colonial home at 1822&nbsp;Camino Palmero in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=19}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=26}} Ricky joined his parents and brother there in 1942.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=19}}

Ricky was a small and insecure child who suffered from severe [[asthma]]. At night, his sleep was eased with a vaporizer emitting tincture of evergreen.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=19–20}} He was described by Red Skelton's producer [[John Guedel]] as "an odd little kid", likable, shy, introspective, mysterious, and inscrutable.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=20}} When Skelton was drafted in 1944, Guedel crafted the radio sitcom ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' for Ricky's parents.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=20}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=29}} The show debuted on Sunday, October 8, 1944, to favorable reviews.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=21}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=30}} Ozzie eventually became head writer for the show and based episodes on the fraternal exploits and enmity of his sons.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=22}} The Nelson boys were first played in the radio series by professional child actors until twelve-year-old Dave and eight-year-old Ricky joined the show on February 20, 1949, in the episode "Invitation to Dinner".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=24–25}}{{sfn|Dennis|2013|p=15}}

[[File:Adv of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson Family 1952.jpg|thumb|The Nelson family, 1952]]
In 1952, the Nelsons tested the waters for a television series with the theatrically released film ''Here Come the Nelsons.'' The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio's airwaves to television's small screen. On October 3, 1952, ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history.

==Education==
Nelson attended Gardner Street Public School,{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=23}} Bancroft Junior High,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=47}} and, between 1954 and 1958, [[Hollywood High School]], from which he graduated with a B average.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} He played [[American football|football]] at Hollywood High{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} and represented the school in interscholastic [[tennis]] matches.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=55}} Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' he hated school because it "smelled of pencils" and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}} In January 1960 the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1/27/1960 episode of "Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" titled 'THE CIRCUS'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/579275570816609584/|title=RICKY NELSON on the TRAPEZE!

Ozzie Nelson was a [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] alumnus and keen on college education,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=15}} but eighteen-year-old Ricky was already in the 93&nbsp;percent income-tax bracket and saw no reason to attend.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} At age thirteen, Ricky was making over $100,000 per annum, and at sixteen he had a personal fortune of $500,000{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=53}} ({{Inflation|US|500000|1956|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).

Nelson's wealth was astutely managed by his parents, who channeled his earnings into trust funds. Although his parents permitted him a $50 allowance at the age of eighteen, Ricky was often strapped for cash and one evening collected and redeemed empty pop bottles to gain entrance to a movie theater for himself and a date.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=54–55}}

==Music career==

===Debut===
Nelson played clarinet and drums in his [[tween (demographic)|tweens]] and early teens, learned the rudimentary guitar chords, and vocally imitated his favorite [[Sun Records]] [[rockabilly]] artists in the bathroom at home or in the showers at the [[Los Angeles Tennis Club]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}} He was strongly influenced by the music of [[Carl Perkins]] and once said he tried to emulate the sound and the tone of the guitar break in Perkins's March 1956 [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]".{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}}

At age sixteen, he wanted to impress his girlfriend of two years, Diana Osborn(e), who was an [[Elvis]] fan and, although he had no record contract at the time, told her that he, too, was going to make a record.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=60}}{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}} With his father's help, he secured a one-record deal with [[Verve Records]], an important jazz label looking for a young and popular personality who could sing or be taught to sing.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=69}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}} On March 26, 1957, he recorded the [[Fats Domino]] standard "[[I'm Walkin']]" and "[[A Teenager's Romance]]" (released in late April 1957 as his first single),<ref name="pc11" /> and "[[You're My One and Only Love]]".{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=71}}

Before the single was released, he made his television rock-and-roll debut on April 10, 1957, singing and playing the drums to "I'm Walkin'" in the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' episode "Ricky, the Drummer".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=72}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=66}} About the same time, he made an unpaid public appearance, singing "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" with [[The Four Preps]] at a Hamilton High School lunch-hour assembly<ref name="pc11" /> in Los Angeles and was greeted by hordes of screaming teens who had seen the television episode.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=75}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}}

"[[I'm Walkin']]" reached No. 4 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Best Sellers in Stores chart, and its flip side, "[[A Teenager's Romance]]", hit #2.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}} When the television series went on summer break in 1957, Nelson made his first road trip and played four state and county fairs in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] with the Four Preps, who opened and closed for him.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=70}}

===First album, band, and #1 single===
In early summer 1957, Ozzie Nelson pulled his son from Verve after disputes about royalties and signed him to a lucrative five-year deal with [[Imperial Records]] that gave him approval over song selection, sleeve artwork, and other production details.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=78–79}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=73–74}} Ricky's first Imperial single, "[[Be-Bop Baby]]", generated 750,000 advance orders, sold over one million copies, and reached No. 3 on the charts. Nelson's first album, ''Ricky'', was released in October 1957 and hit #1 before the end of the year.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=76}} Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=80}}

Nelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=81}} Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist [[James Burton]] was the first signed. Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=83}} Their first recording together was "[[Believe What You Say]]". Prior to this, [[Joe Maphis]] had been playing the lead guitar part, and played lead on his first hits "Be-Bop Baby", "Stood Up", and "Waitin In School".

In 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old [[Sharon Sheeley]]'s "[[Poor Little Fool]]" for his second album, ''Ricky Nelson'', released in June 1958.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=89}} Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=89–90}} On August 4, 1958, "Poor Little Fool" became the #1 single on ''Billboard'''s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=91}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=90}} and sold over two million copies.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}

Nelson stated:
{{blockquote|Anyone who knocks rock 'n' roll either doesn't understand it, or is prejudiced against it, or is just plain square. – ''[[NME]]'' – November 1958<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3" />}}

[[File:Ricky Nelson - publicity.JPG|thumb|Nelson publicity photo, 1960]]
During 1958 and 1959, Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] eleven. During these two years, Presley had recorded music only for the movie ''[[King Creole]]'', in January and February 1958, before his induction into the U.S. Armed Forces and a brief recording session (consisting of five songs) while on [[Leave (military)|military leave]] four months later. In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly. By 1960, the Ricky Nelson International Fan Club had 9,000 chapters around the world.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=92–93}}
{{blockquote|Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in my career was when six girls tried to fling themselves under my car, and shouted to me to run over them. That sort of thing can be very frightening! – ''NME'' – May 1960<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2" />}}

Nelson was the first teen idol to use television to promote hit records. Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for "Travelin' Man". Nelson appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He starred in the episode "A Hand For Sonny Blue" from the 1977 series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the United Kingdom as ''Twist in the Tale''). In 1979, he guest-hosted on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', spoofing his television sitcom image by appearing in a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' sendup in which, always trying to go "home," he finds himself among the characters from other 1950s/early 1960s-era sitcoms, ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'', and ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Nelson knew and loved music and was a skilled performer even before he became a [[teen idol]], largely because of his parents' musical background. Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including [[James Burton]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Allen "Puddler" Harris]], all natives of [[Louisiana]], and [[Joe Maphis]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Johnny Burnette|Johnny]] and [[Dorsey Burnette]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Nelson's music was very well recorded with a clear, punchy sound—thanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskell.<ref name="Tech" />

From 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and [[Pat Boone]] (38). Many of Nelson's early records were double hits with both the A and B sides hitting the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

While Nelson preferred [[rockabilly]] and [[uptempo]] rock [[songs]] like "[[Believe What You Say]]" (Hot 100 #4), "[[I Got a Feeling (Ricky Nelson song)|I Got a Feeling]]" (#10), "[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]" (#12), "[[Hello Mary Lou]]" (#9), "It's Late" (#9), "[[Stood Up (song)|Stood Up]]" (#2), "[[Waitin' In School (song)|Waitin' in School]]" (#18), "[[Be-Bop Baby]]" (#3), and "[[Just a Little Too Much]]" (#9), his smooth, calm voice made him a natural to sing ballads.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He had major success with "[[Travelin' Man]]" (#1), "[[A Teenager's Romance]]" (#2), "Poor Little Fool" (#1), "[[Young World (song)|Young World]]" (#5), "[[Lonesome Town]]" (#7), "[[Never Be Anyone Else But You]]" (#6), "[[Sweeter Than You]]" (#9), "[[It's Up to You (Ricky Nelson song)|It's Up to You]]" (#6), and "[[Teen Age Idol]]" (#5), which clearly could have been about Nelson himself.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

==Film actor==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}
[[File:Howard Hawks'Rio Bravo trailer (33-2).jpg|thumb|upright|Nelson in ''Rio Bravo'', 1959]]
[[File:John Wayne and Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson in 'Rio Bravo', 1959.jpg|thumb|right|upright]]
In addition to his recording career, Nelson appeared in movies. He made his film debut in ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]'' (1952) and had a small role in ''[[The Story of Three Loves]]'' (1953) at MGM directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] playing [[Farley Granger]] as a boy.

Following his success on TV and with singing, [[Howard Hawks]] cast him as a gunslinger in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]]; Hawks attributed much of the film's box office success to Nelson.

Nelson co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'' (1960), which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series (in which Nelson did not appear). He guest starred on ''[[General Electric Theatre]]'' ("The Wish Book") and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father, ''[[Love and Kisses (1965 movie)|Love and Kisses]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]].

Nelson guest starred on ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]'' (playing [[Jesse James]]), and had a support role in ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'' (1969) with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]].

Nelson was in ''[[Fol-de-Rol]]'' (1972), guest starred on ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|A Twist in the Tale]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. On ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' he played the part of "Tony Eagle" and performed various well-known Nelson songs throughout the episode.

He had support roles in the TV films ''[[Three on a Date]]'' and ''[[High School USA]]'' (1983).

==Name change and 1960s career==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}
On May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from "Ricky Nelson" to "Rick Nelson". His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on "Ozzie and Harriet". Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting [[Carl Perkins]], Perkins noted that he and "Ricky" were the last of the "rockabilly breed".

In 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with [[Decca Records]]. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964's "For You" (#6), Nelson's chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of [[Beatlemania]], [[The British Invasion]], and later the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture era]]. However, instead of dropping him, Decca kept him on board.

In the mid-1960s, Nelson began to move toward [[country music]], becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called "[[California Sound]]" (which would include singers like [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] and bands such as [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the [[Top 40]] again until 1970, when he recorded [[Bob Dylan]]'s "She Belongs to Me" with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring [[Randy Meisner]], who in 1971 became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and former [[The Buckaroos|Buckaroo]] steel guitarist [[Tom Brumley]].

=="Garden Party" and short-lived comeback==
[[File:Rick Nelson performing 1970.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson performing on ''The Jim Nabors Show'' in 1970]]
In 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with "[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]," a song he wrote in disgust after a [[Richard Nader]] [[Oldies]] Concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] where the audience booed, perhaps against some unrelated police action. However, Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits.<ref name="straightdope1" /> When he performed [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[Honky Tonk Women]]," there was booing, said to be against police and not him.<ref name="straightdope1" /> He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his "oldies." He returned to the stage and played his "oldies" and the audience responded with applause, according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire ''Garden Party'' album yet. "Garden Party" reached No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart]] and was certified as a [[RIAA certification|gold single]]. The second single released from the album was "Palace Guard" which peaked at #65.

In 1973, [[MCA Records]], whose parent company [[MCA Inc.]] had owned American Decca since 1962, ceased the label's operations, and transferred Nelson (and many other Decca artists) to its roster. His comeback was short-lived, and Nelson's band soon resigned. MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. A new band was formed by [[Lindy Goetz]], then a promotion person at MCA Records.<ref name="GoodReads" /> Nelson's band moved to Aspen and changed their name to "Canyon." Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the ''[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]'' album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of ''Garden Party.''

In 1974, MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like ''[[Windfall (Rick Nelson album)|Windfall]]'' failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like [[Knott's Berry Farm]] and [[Disneyland]]. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.

Nelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like "Rock and Roll Lady." With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.

==Personal life==
[[File:Rick kris nelson 1964.JPG|thumb|Ricky and Kristin Nelson in 1964]]

In 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with [[Marianne Gaba]], who played the role of Ricky's girlfriend in three episodes of ''Ozzie and Harriet''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=136}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=72}} Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship, although according to Gaba "we used to [[Making out|neck]] ''for hours''."{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=73}}

The next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old [[Lorrie Collins]], a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called ''Town Hall Party''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=106}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=81}} The two wrote Nelson's first composition, the song "My Gal", and she introduced him to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Tex Ritter]]. Collins appeared in an ''Ozzie and Harriet'' episode as Ricky's girlfriend and sang "Just Because" with him in the musical finale.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=83}} They went steady and discussed marriage, but their parents discouraged the idea.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=83, 116}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=138, 145}}

===Kris Harmon===
At Christmas 1961, Nelson began dating [[Kristin Nelson|Kristin Harmon]] (June 25, 1945 – April 26, 2018), a daughter of football player [[Tom Harmon]] and actress [[Elyse Knox]] (née Elsie Kornbrath) and the older sister of [[Kelly Harmon|Kelly]] and [[Mark Harmon]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=138, 140–141}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=140}} The Nelsons and the Harmons had long been friends, and a union between their children held great appeal.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=139}} Rick and Kris had much in common: quiet dispositions, Hollywood upbringings, and high-powered, domineering fathers.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=140}}

They married on April 20, 1963. Kris was pregnant,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=149}} and Rick later described the union as a "[[shotgun wedding]]".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=144}} Nelson, a nonpracticing Protestant, received instruction in Catholicism at the insistence of the bride's parents{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=144}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=137, 149}} and signed a pledge to have any children of the union raised in the Catholic faith.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=149}} Kris Nelson joined the television show as a regular cast member in 1963.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=145}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=150}} They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Kristine Nelson]], twin sons Gunnar Eric Nelson and Matthew Gray Nelson who formed the band [[Nelson (band)|Nelson]], and Sam Hilliard Nelson.

By 1975, following the birth of their last child, the marriage had deteriorated and a very public, controversial divorce involving both families was covered in the press for several years. In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=230}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=205}} Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris's extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=251}} The impasse over Rick's career created unpleasantness at home. Kris became an alcoholic and left the children in the care of household help.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=218}} After years of legal proceedings, they were divorced in December 1982. The divorce was financially devastating for Nelson, with attorneys and accountants taking over $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=221}} Years of legal wrangling followed.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=237}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=262}}

===Helen Blair===
{{anchor|Helen Blair}}
In 1980, Nelson met Helen Blair, a part-time model and exotic-animal trainer, in [[Las Vegas]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=242}} Within months of their meeting, she became his road companion, and in 1982 she began living with him. She was the only woman he dated after his divorce.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=242}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=260}}

[[File:Ricky Nelson free.jpg|thumb|Nelson plays at a concert in Lawton, Oklahoma]]

Blair acted as personal assistant to Nelson, organizing his day and acting as a liaison for his fan club,{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=242}} but Nelson's mother, brother, business manager, and manager disapproved of her presence in his life.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=242, 244}} He contemplated marrying her but eventually declined.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=246}} Blair died with Nelson in the airplane fire. Her name was never mentioned at Nelson's funeral.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=273}} Blair's parents wanted their daughter buried next to Nelson at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Cemetery]], but Harriet Nelson dismissed the idea.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=244}} The Blairs refused to bury Helen's remains and filed a $2&nbsp;million [[wrongful death]] suit against Nelson's estate.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=273}} They received a small settlement. {{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=271}}

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Ricky Nelson}}

On December 31, 1985, Nelson died when the [[Douglas DC-3]] on which he was a passenger crashed into trees, poles, and electrical wires, when it attempted to make an emergency landing while in flight between [[Guntersville, Alabama]], and [[Dallas]], Texas, where he was to perform a [[New Year's Eve]] concert.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=261–262}} Nelson's DC-3 seemed constantly beset by mechanical problems.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=259}} The fatal fire was caused by a defective heater in the tail of the plane. The heater caught fire and filled the cabin with toxic fumes. While both pilots survived, all seven passengers died.<ref name="NTSB" />

'''Roy Kelton Orbison''' (April 23, 1936&nbsp;– December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist known for his distinctive and powerful voice, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. Orbison's music is mostly in the [[rock music]] genre and his most successful periods were in the early 1960s and the late 1980s. He was nicknamed "The [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock" and "The Big&nbsp;O". Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers projected [[machismo]]. He performed with minimal motion and in black clothes, matching his dyed black hair and dark [[sunglasses]].

Born in Texas, Orbison began singing in a [[Country music|country-and-western]] band as a teenager. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956 after 
[[Johnny Cash]] urged him to go to [[Sun Records|Sun]]. [[Elvis]] was leaving Sun and Phillips was looking to replace him. His first [[Sun]] recording, [[Ooby Dooby]] was a direct musical sound-a-like of Elvis's early Sun recordings. He had some success at [[Sun]] but enjoyed his greatest success with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40. He wrote or {{Nowrap|co-wrote}} almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including "[[Only the Lonely]]" (1960), "[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]" (1961), "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" (1961), "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" (1963), and "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" (1964).

After the mid-1960s Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies, and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s, following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he {{Nowrap|co-founded}} the [[Traveling Wilburys]] supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack that December at age 52. One month later, his song "[[You Got It]]" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach both the US and UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.

Orbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. He received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and five other Grammy Awards. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on its list of the "Greatest Artists of All Time" and number 13 on its list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.

==Early life==
Orbison was born on April 23, 1936, in [[Vernon, Texas]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Orbison |first=Roy Jr. |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|publisher=Center Street|others=Wesley Orbison, Alex Orbison, Jeff Slate|date=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|edition=first|location=New York|page=27|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> He was the second of three sons born to Orbie Lee Orbison (1913–1984) and Nadine Vesta Shults (1914–1992).

Orbison's father gave him a guitar on his sixth birthday and Roy was taught how to play it by his father and older brother.<ref name=offbio>{{cite web | url=https://royorbison.com/roy-orbison-official-biography/ | title=ROY ORBISON – OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY – Roy Orbison }}</ref> Roy recalled, "I was finished, you know, for anything else" by the time he was 7, and music became the focus of his life.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 7.</ref> His major musical influence as a youth was country and [[western swing]] music. He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 21.</ref> leading Orbison to adopt the stage name "Lefty Wilbury" during his time with the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Moon Mullican]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians that he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. Orbison also said that a formative experience was the regular singing sessions at Fort Worth, where he was surrounded by soldiers who were intensely emotional because they were about to be sent to the front line in World War II. In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]], [[western swing]], [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music. The cajun favorite "[[Jole Blon]]" was one of the first songs that he sang in public. He began singing on a local radio show at age 8, and he became the show's host by the late 1940s.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p8-9}} At the age of 9, Orbison won a contest on radio station [[KVWC (AM)|KVWC]], which led to his own radio show where he sang the same songs every week.<ref name=offbio/> He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School<ref name="Orbison-2017-28" /> in Fort Worth until a polio scare in 1944 prompted his parents to send Roy (then aged 8) and his brother Grady Lee to Vernon to live with their grandmother.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p8}} As World War II wound down, Roy's parents returned to Vernon.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p3}}

The Orbison family moved again in 1946, to [[Wink, Texas]] in search of employment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Orbison |first1=Roy Jr. |last2=Orbison |first2=Alex |last3=Orbison |first3=Wesley |last4=Slate |first4=Jeff |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison |publisher=Center Street |location=New York |date=2017 |page=31 |oclc=1017566749 |isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7}}</ref> Orbison described life in Wink as "football, oil fields, oil, grease, and sand"<ref name="escott">Escott, Colin (1990).

==Career==
===1949–1955: ''Wink Westerners''===
In 1949, Orbison (then 13 years old) formed the band ''Wink Westerners''<ref name=offbio/> with school friends Billy Pat Ellis on drums, Slob Evans on bass fiddle, Richard West on piano, and James Morrow on electric mandolin.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p16}} They played country and [[western swing]] standards and [[Glenn Miller]] jazz swing songs at local [[honky-tonk]] bars and had a weekly morning radio show on [[KERB (AM)|KERB]] in [[Kermit, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |title=History Maker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401175007/http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |website=The Official Roy Orbison Site |access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> Their first performance was at a school assembly in 1953.<ref name=offbio/> They were offered $400 to play at a dance, and Orbison realized that he could make a living in music.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p23}} Orbison was also part of a [[marching band]] and singing [[Octet (music)|octet]].<ref name=offbio/> At the age of 15, Orbison decided that instead of becoming a guitar player, he would use the guitar as an accompaniment to his singing.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p26}}

In 1953 the Wink Westerners entered a talent contest on [[KMID-TV]] in [[Midland, Texas]].{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} The group won the contest, resulting in a 30-minute spot on a local television show.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p27}} After the show, Orbison asked the owner of the company sponsoring the show if he could sponsor the group for ongoing shows, which led to the Wink Westerners playing weekly shows on KMID-TV on Friday nights and on Odessa television station [[KOSA-TV]] on Saturday nights.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p28}}{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} It was around this time that Orbison began dyeing his hair (naturally a "dishwater grey color") to jet black.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p28}}

After graduating from high school in 1954, Orbison enrolled at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]]. His plan was to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay; however, he became bored with the course in its first year and switched to History and English.<ref name=offbio/> But Orbison preferred to play music with fellow students Billy Pat Ellis, [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p29-30}} Penner and Moore had written a simple, catchy rockabilly song called "Ooby Dooby", which impressed Orbison and he started looking into how he could make a recording of it.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p30}} Orbison continued performing with the Wink Westerners after his first year.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} He then heard that his schoolmate [[Pat Boone]] had signed a record deal, and it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p30}} At a New Year's Eve dance in 1954, the Wink Westerners had mostly played country and [[western swing]] music throughout the night, but ended the night by playing [[Bill Haley & the Comets]]’ hit song ''[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]'' repeatedly, which became the catalyst for the band switching to [[rock and roll]] music.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p31}} Also, Orbison had seen [[Elvis Presley]] perform back during his days at North Texas State College in 1954 and was impressed by the shocking gyrations that Elvis exhibited on stage.{{efn|Orbison later said that he "couldn't overemphasize how shocking" Presley looked and seemed to him that night.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 26–27.</ref>}}

===1955–1956: ''The Teen Kings''===
{{main|Roy Orbison's Sun recordings}}
At the end of the spring semester of 1955, Orbison dropped out of North Texas State College, switching to [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College.]]<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p32}} The Wink Westerners were disbanded in the fall of 1955 and Orbison formed a new band called ''The Teen Kings''.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} The band was made of Orbison, Billy Pat Ellis and James Morrow from the Wink Westerners, plus Jack Kennelly on bass and Johnny Wilson.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p32}} It was at a dance event where ''The Teen Kings'' performed that Orbison met his future wife Claudette Frady.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p30}} Claudette was fourteen at the time, five years younger than Orbison.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}}

''The Teen Kings'''s first recording was the song ''Ooby Dooby'', which was recorded at [[Norman Petty]]'s studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]] in March 1956.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=254}} It was published by Odessa-based start-up label [[Je–Wel]]<ref name="escott"/>{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=245}} as the B-side of the ''JE-WEL 101'' single.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p36}} The A-side of the single was ''Tryin' to Get to You'', a song previously recorded by Elvis Presley.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p36}}

After ''Ooby Dooby'' was published by Je-Wel Records, Orbison became convinced that a larger record company would be able to sell more copies of the record, and he spoke to a lawyer about breaking the contract with Je-Wel.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}} Initially, Orbison obtained an injunction to prevent Je-Wel from distributing the record, before they reached an agreement that the band would pay back the label the costs of producing the records.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}} Orbison was now free to find a new label to market Ooby Dooby; however, a further setback was that he cut a demo of the song for [[Columbia Records]] which they turned down but had one of their contract artists ([[Sid King]]) release a recording of ''Ooby Dooby'' before Orbison could offer the tape to another record company.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}}

Eventually, [[Sun Records]] would sign up to record ''Ooby Dooby'', but the events that led to this are disputed.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}} Some claim that [[Johnny Cash]] toured the Odessa area in 1955 and 1956,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} Cash stated that "in late '55 or early '56, I was touring with Elvis when I met Roy in Texas... I told him to get in touch with Sun Records if he wanted to be a recording artist". Orbison has said that when he did this, [[Sam Phillips]] (the owner of [[Sun Records]]) told him "Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}} However, both Sam Philips and Billy Pat Ellis (the band's drummer) have disputed that Johnny Cash was involved.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42-43}} Three of ''The Teen Kings'' band members have said that their relationship with Sun Records began when Odessa record store owner Poppa Holifield played it over the telephone for Sam Phillips in April 1956, and Phillips offered the Teen Kings a contract.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}}<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}}

The Teen Kings went to [[Sun Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], in order to re-record ''Ooby Dooby'' for publication by [[Sun Records]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}} After an audition of the song, Sam Phillips signed the band up for "a year or two".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p47}} However, the band's career soon slumped, since Orbison wanted to record emotional ballads rather than the rockabilly songs demanded by Sam Phillips, and Phillips's goal for a successor to Elvis Presley had moved on from Orbison to [[Carl Perkins]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p51}} ''The Teen Kings'' were granted a reprieve when Carl Perkins was badly injured in a car crash, resulting in ''Ooby Dooby'' being released (along with ''Go Go Go'') as Sun Single 242 in May 1956.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p51}}{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} ''The Teen Kings'' began an experimental tour of [[drive-in theatre|drive-in theaters]] in the southern U.S. states (playing on top of projection house roofs between drive-in film showings) with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], [[Carl Perkins]], and Johnny Cash.<ref name="offbio" /> Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing "everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record".<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 44.</ref> Orbison also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including ''[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]'' and ''Rockhouse''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Orbison|first1=Roy Jr.|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last2=Orbison Alex|last3=Orbison|first3=Wesley|last4=Slate|first4=Jeff|publisher=Center Street|date=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|location=New York|pages=50, 57|language=English|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> In June 1956, ''Ooby Dooby'' peaked at number 59 in the Billboard charts and sold 200,000 copies,<ref name="escott"/> however the follow-up singles didn't reach the charts.<ref name="offbio"/>

''The Teen Kings'' played alongside Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Warren Smith and Eddie Bond at the [[Overton Park Shell]] on June 1, 1956, but Orbison's relationship with the rest of the band was deteriorating at this stage.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} Elvis Presley was in the audience for this show and Orbison claimed that Elvis praised Orbison, but another band member says that it was actually Jack Kennelly (the band's bass player) that Presley praised.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} Kennelly said that "Roy's dream was to be a star, and once Sam (Phillips) inflated his ego he couldn't be a part of a unit. Roy became egomaniacal".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} In the summer of 1956, Orbison purchased a brand-new purple Cadillac and a diamond ring with his first royalty cheque from ''Ooby Dooby'';<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} however, the band soon found out that their pay cheques from the concerts were not covering their costs and that life as a touring band was a demoralizing experience.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p55}} The band's contract didn't include any royalty payments ("BMI") when their songs were played on the radio and Orbison had run out of money by late 1956.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p58}} Orbison was encouraged by Norman Petty to record a single without ''The Teen Kings'' and the rest of the band walked on Roy during a recording session when told of a plan to rename the band ''Roy Orbison and The Teen Kings''.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p56}} The band broke up in December 1956<ref name="offbio" /> and Sam Phillips said they were arguing about money but the basic problem was that Orbison was too much of a loner and driven egoist.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p61}} The lack of a band was a serious problem for Orbison's contract at Sun Records, since the label had no use for a singer who didn't have a band.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p61}}

===1956–1959: Solo work and Acuff-Rose Music===
[[File:Roy Orbison 1965 (2).png|thumb|Orbison with his original thick-rimmed glasses ({{circa|1950s–1960s}})]]

After ''The Teen Kings'' split, Orbison stayed in Memphis with his girlfriend Claudette.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, and Phillips stated that they didn't sleep together in his house.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p63}} However, Orbison was broke and realized that he couldn't survive as a recording artist, so after several weeks he returned to the road. He toured with Johnny Cash, Sonny Burgess, Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, playing mostly songs from other artists before finishing the set with a song of his own.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p64}} At the time, Orbison was addicted to sleeping pills and speed.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p67}} Orbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, and at some stage picked up a date for Presley in his purple [[Cadillac]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}}

In August 1957, Orbison returned to the Sun Recording Studio and recorded several new songs with just his acoustic guitar instead of a backing band.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p68}} However, none were successful and Roy gave up on becoming a recording artist.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p68}} Sam Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p60-61}} Orbison returned to Odessa, Texas in the fall of 1957 to be together with his sixteen-year-old girlfriend, Claudette.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p69}} The two began to talk about getting married. On a professional level, Orbison met singer [[Joe Melson]] while in Memphis, who would collaborate with Orbison on his biggest hit songs in the early 1960s.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p70}}

A ballad Orbison wrote, ''The Clown'', met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref> Nonetheless, he continued to pitch his ballad ''[[Claudette (song)|Claudette]]'' (which he began working on in early 1956) to singers he met on tour<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p68}} and in April 1958 [[The Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of their hit ''[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]''.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p76}} ''Claudette'' reached number 30 in the charts in March 1959.<ref name="offbio" /> Orbison then left Sun Records, due to a dispute about royalties from the song ''Claudette'' (which was recorded by Nashville Records).<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p72}} Orbison and Claudette had married in 1957 and their first child was born on September 16, 1958.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p76}} Using the royalty payments from The Everly Brothers hit ''Claudette'', Orbison bought the most expensive new pink Cadillac available.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p76}} However, Roy and Claudette spent the money lavishly and were soon broke and living with Roy's parents in Wink.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p78}}

Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>

During the period of 1958–1959, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music]],<ref name="offbio" /> a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison then worked with, and was in awe of, [[Chet Atkins]] (who had played guitar with Presley) and attempted to sell his recordings of songs by other writers to the [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] record label. One of these songs was ''Seems to Me'', by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of "a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then—softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>

Playing shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68–69.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs for [[RCA Victor]] at their [[RCA Studio B|Nashville studios]]; only two singles (''Paper Boy'' and ''With the Bug''<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p86}}) were judged worthy of release by the label.<ref name="Zak, p. 32.">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]], the record label that Orbison would soon switch to.<ref name="offbio" />

=== 1960–1964: Monument Records and stardom ===
====Early singles====
[[File:Roy Orbison - Cash Box 1960.png|160px|thumb|Orbison on the cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'', September 3, 1960]]

In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA Victor had refused, "Paper Boy". It was accompanied by the B-side sing "With the Bug", but neither song charted.<ref name="Zak, p. 33.">Zak, p. 33.</ref>

Orbison's own style, the sound created at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Victor Studio B]] in Nashville with pioneer engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a "polished, professional sound... finally allowing Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein".<ref name="Zak, p. 32."/> Orbison requested to use [[string instrument|string instruments]] instead of [[fiddle|fiddles]], which was unusual for the time.<ref name="offbio" /><ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p87}} He recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was "Uptown", written with Joe Melson and released in late 1959.<ref name="offbio" /><ref name="Lehman, p. 48.">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, "We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world."<ref name="escott"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70–71.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville "brought a new splendour to rock", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>

"Uptown" was a modest hit and the first song by Orbison and Melson to reach the ''Billboard'' Top 100.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p89}} His initial success came just as the 1950s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>

====''Only the Lonely''====
[[File:Blue Angel - Today's Teardrops - Billboard ad 1960.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, September 12, 1960]] 
Experimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from "Uptown", and another song they had written called "Come Back to Me (My Love)", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name="Zak, p. 35.">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, "came not from his throat but deeper within".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was "[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]". Orbison was passing through Memphis when he tried to pitch the song to Elvis Presley (along with several other songs) in order to make some money quickly, but it was early in the morning and Presley did not want to see Orbison at that time.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p91}} Orbison and Melson instead recorded the song at RCA Victor's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name="Lehman, p. 48."/><ref>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter-Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name="Zak, p. 35."/>

"Only the Lonely" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia.<ref name="offbio" /> According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, "I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of "Ooby Dooby" and "Only the Lonely", it kind of turned into a good voice."<ref name="rockhall">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> But at the time of its recording, Orbison was struggling to earn a living, because he was only working as a singer at local dances.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p94}} Also the days of his working with Melson were numbered, due to disagreements such as who came up with the title for ''Only the Lonely''.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p95}} The success of ''Only The Lonely'' transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard "Only the Lonely" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p98}}

Soon after recording an early version of his next hit ''[[Blue Angel (song)|Blue Angel]]'', Orbison and his wife and son (Roy DeWayne, born in 1958) moved from Wink to the suburb of Hendersonville in [[Nashville]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p94}} Orbison's second son, Anthony King, would follow in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Orbison|first1=Roy Jr.|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last2=Orbison Alex|last3=Orbison|first3=Wesley|last4=Slate|first4=Jeff|publisher=Center Street|date=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|location=New York|page=92|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> Melson also moved to Hendersonville soon after, and began working on ''Blue Angel'' together, which was recorded in August 1960.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p102}} This hit was a more complex song, yet it still peaked at number nine in the USA.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p102}} The follow-up single ''I'm Hurtin''' (with ''[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]'' as the B-side) rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} After the success of ''Blue Angel'', Orbison undertook a hectic touring schedule, often performing with his neighbor [[Patsy Cline]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p103}} During this time, Claudette was lonely and unhappy, and some people said that Orbison was unfaithful to her while he was on tour.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p104}}

Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of "Only the Lonely", "Blue Angel", and "I'm Hurtin'",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Orbison |first1=Roy |last2=Orbison |first2=Alex |last3=Orbison |first3=Wesley |last4=Slate |first4=Jeff |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison |publisher=Center Street |location=New York |date=2017 |page=245 |oclc=1017566749 |isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7}}</ref> Orbison worked on a new song, "[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]", about a man worried that his girlfriend is about to leave him for another man.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p106}} Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio, and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81–82.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, "Running Scared" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, "He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before."<ref name="escott"/> Just weeks later "Running Scared" became Orbison's first number one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart<ref name="offbio" /> and it reached number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected "Running Scared": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}

The B-side ''Crying'' followed soon after and reached the top 5 singles in August 1961.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p107}} ''Crying'' was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, ''[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]'', written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} By the end of 1961, Orbison had recorded six hit singles in a row over the past two years.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p107}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as "The Big O"{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}, partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with "[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. Orbison enlisted The Webbs, from Dothan, Alabama, as his backing band. The band changed their names to ''The Candy Men'' (in reference to Roy's hit) and played with Orbison from 1962 to 1967.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Orbison |first1=Roy Jr. |last2=Orbison |first2=Alex |last3=Orbison |first3=Wesley |last4=Slate |first4=Jeff |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison |publisher=Center Street |location=New York |date=2017 |page=137 |oclc=1017566749 |isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7}}</ref> They later went on to have their own career, releasing a few singles and two albums on their own. Also in 1962, he charted with "The Crowd", "Leah", and "Workin' for the Man", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p32}} Orbison's relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating, over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>

Orbison first met [[Bob Dylan]] at Dylan's 21st birthday party in May 1962.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p112}}

From 1959–1963, Orbison was the top selling American artist and one of the world’s biggest names.<ref name="offbio" />

====Public image====
[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|Orbison performing in his trademark dark glasses]]
Orbison eventually developed an image that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, and therefore had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an "anonymous celebrity".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Faosa sunglasses on stage<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p109}} and found that he preferred them.

====''In Dreams'' and international tours====
Orbison's string of top-40 hits continued with "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" (US number 7 in January 1963,<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p114}} UK number 6), "Falling" (US number 22, UK number 9), and "[[Mean Woman Blues]]" (US number 5, UK number 3) coupled with "[[Blue Bayou]]" (US number 29, UK number 3).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name="britishhits">Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.</ref> According to the discography in ''The Authorized Roy Orbison'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Orbison |first1=Roy Jr. |last2=Orbison |first2=Alex |last3=Orbison |first3=Wesley |last4=Slate |first4=Jeff |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison |location=New York |edition=1st |year=2017 |page=245 |oclc=1017566749 |isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7}}</ref> a rare alternative version of "Blue Bayou" was released in Italy.

As "In Dreams" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with [[the Beatles]]. The tour sold out in one afternoon.<ref name="offbio" /> When Orbison arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, "What's a Beatle, anyway?" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, "I am".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p115}} On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison simply played through 14 encores.<ref name="clayson109-113">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109–113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting "We want Roy!" again, Lennon and [[Paul McCartney]] physically held Orbison back.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p117}} [[Ringo Starr]] later said, "In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything."<ref name="clayson109-113"/> Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.<ref>Lennon, John; McCartney, Paul; Harrison, George; Starr, Ringo (2002). ''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94.</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was [[George Harrison]] with whom he would later form a strong friendship.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

In 1963, touring took a toll on Orbison's personal life. After discovering a letter from one of Orbison's secret girlfriends, his wife Claudette had an affair with the builder of their home in Tennessee.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p120}} Billy Pat Ellis said "Claudette had the affair because Roy was gone a lot and she got lonely and wanted to prove she was attractive again".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p120}} When Orbison toured Britain again in the autumn of 1963, she joined him.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p122-3}} 

Later in 1963, Orbison toured England, Ireland and Canada.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p122}} In 1964, he toured Australia and New Zealand with the [[Beach Boys]]<ref name="offbio" /> and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p125}} He traveled to Australia again in 1965, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]].<ref name="offbio" /> [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, "a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p134}}

Orbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote "[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]", a number-one hit in the UK and Orbison's most successful song.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p126}} When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, "A pretty woman never needs any money".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p127}} Just 40 minutes later, "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the autumn of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending a total of 18 weeks on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name="escott"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p128}}

===1965–1969: Career decline and tragedies===
[[File:Roy Orbison 1967.png|thumb|Orbison in 1967]]
By late 1964, Orbison had "occasionally treated himself to a [[groupie]]"<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p130}} and his wife Claudette had had an affair with the builder Braxton Dixon, who had built Orbison's house.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p121}} After Roy became aware of the affair, he fired Dixon and finished building the house himself (with the help of a hired carpenter).<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p132}} In early 1965, Roy confirmed that he and Claudette were divorced.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p132}} Later in 1965, Claudette gave birth to Roy's third child, and Roy and Claudette re-united several months later.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p143}}

Orbison's singles in early 1965 had been unsuccessful and his contract with Monument was expiring soon.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p137}} Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to [[MGM Records]] (though in Europe he remained with [[Decca Records|Decca's]] [[London Records]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/hlu9986 |title=Roy Orbison - Ride Away / Wondering - London - UK - HLU 9986 |website=45cat |access-date=August 29, 2015}}</ref>) for $1&nbsp;million<ref name="offbio" /> and with the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast, and when not touring, writing, or recording, he dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130–131.</ref> The move was described as Orbison "joining the ranks of fading rock stars fleeing to MGM".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p137}}

Rose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Victor's A-Team in Nashville.<ref name="Zak, p. 33."/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name="escott"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964–65, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation (Orbison was 28 in 1964) were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref> The contractual requirement to release a certain amount of singles and albums per year for MGM also took its toll on the quality of Orbison's songs.<ref name="offbio" />

Orbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p126}} While on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to Britain to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}

Roy and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles after Roy had been introduced to them by Elvis Presley.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p54}} Orbison was a daredevil driver, blasting around on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and owning a Ferrari car, which he used to challenge other drivers to race him on the highway.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p1}} On June 6, 1966, when Orbison and Claudette were both riding their motorcycles home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]], she was struck by a pickup truck in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref> and thrown into the air. She was taken by ambulance to hospital, but her liver was seriously injured and she died, aged 25.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p148}}

A grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well.<ref name="offbio" /> It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108–109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole and had to protect and deliver a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]] and was supplied with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line "I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time", with, according to biographer [[Colin Escott]], "zero conviction".<ref name="escott"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box-office failure. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 146–147.</ref><ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p151-3}}

He recorded an album dedicated to the songs of [[Don Gibson]] and another of [[Hank Williams]] covers, but both sold poorly.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p153}} During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison lost mainstream appeal, yet seemed confident that this would return, later saying: "[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to, so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref> Orbison's single ''Cry Softly Lonely One'' from March 1967 was his last song to enter the Top 100 until the 1980s.<ref name="offbio" />

During a tour of Britain and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161–63.</ref> This occurred two years after the death of his wife Claudette and Orbison's grief meant he couldn't write songs.<ref name="offbio" /> Fire officials stated that the cause of the fire may have been an [[aerosol]] can, which possibly contained [[lacquer]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hendersonville, TN Home Fire Roy Orbison's House, Sep 1968 {{!}} GenDisasters ...

During the 1968 tour of England, Orbison and his childhood friend Bobby Blackburn slept with many girls over the course of two months, and used a calendar on the wall to track when each girl was arriving and leaving their rented apartment in Upper Brook Street in London.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p156}} During this time, Orbison met the sixteen year-old German girl [[Barbara Orbison|Barbara Wellhonen]], with whom he became fascinated,<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p156}} although Orbison continued to see other girls in the meantime.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p157}} On May 25, 1969,<ref name="offbio" /> Orbison and Wellhonen got married.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p163}} Roy was 33 years old at the time, and sources vary regarding whether Wellhonen was either 17, 18 or 19.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p163}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bandweblogs.com/blog/2008/10/10/barbara-orbison-exclusive-interview/ | title=Barbara Orbison EXCLUSIVE interview – Band Weblogs }}</ref> Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents. Orbison and Wellhonen had a son (Roy Kelton) in 1970 and another ([[Alex Orbison|Alexander]]) in 1975.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 178.</ref>

===1970s: Struggles===
[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]

Orbison continued recording albums in the 1970s, but his career went nowhere during this decade<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p169}}. In 1974 he switched record labels from MGM to [[Mercury Records]] for a one-album deal.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p170}}<ref name="offbio" /> Although the peak of his success was over, his single ''Penny Arcade'' was number one in Australia for many weeks and ''Too Soon to Know'' reached number 3 in England.<ref name="offbio" /> His fortunes sank so low in America that his concerts were mostly empty, such as the concert at Cincinnati Gardens that he played on his fortieth birthday in April 1976<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p174}}. Peter Lehman observed that Orbison's absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: "Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone."<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released popular covers of his songs. Orbison's version of "[[Love Hurts]]" was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by hard rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]]' version of "Only the Lonely" reached number one on the country music charts.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p167-8}} [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of "Dream Baby".

A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits reached number one in the UK in January 1976, and Orbison began to open concerts that year for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who had started as [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backup band. Ronstadt herself covered "[[Blue Bayou]]" in 1977, her version reaching number three on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p178}} He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded ''[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]'' with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.

In late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to spend the winter in Hawaii. He checked in to a hospital there where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]] and was barely alive<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p177}}. Orbison underwent open-heart surgery on January 18, 1978.<ref name="offbio" /> He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183–184.</ref> Orbison said he felt rejuvenated after the procedure; however, he continued to smoke cigarettes, despite the advice of his doctor<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p178}}.

=== 1980–1988: Revival and Traveling Wilburys ===
[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|right|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]
In 1980, [[Don McLean]] recorded a cover of Orbison's 1961 hit single "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]"{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} and it went to the top of the charts, first in the Netherlands then reaching number five in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was number one in the UK for three weeks and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p182}} In 1981 he performed "Pretty Woman" on an episode of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0567227/|title = The Great Hazzard Hijack| website=[[IMDb]] |date = March 27, 1981}}</ref> Orbison was all but forgotten in the US, yet he reached popularity in less likely places such as [[Bulgaria]] in 1982.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964, and he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p183}} In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet "That Lovin' You Feelin' Again" from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'' (in which Orbison also played a cameo role), and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was Orbison's first Grammy, and he felt hopeful of making a full return to popular music,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of "Oh, Pretty Woman" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's music.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}

Orbison, his wife and two oldest children moved from Nashville to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] in 1986<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p189}}. Following the move, Orbison's involvement with the Los Angeles creative community proved to be very important for him<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p214}}.

It has been alleged that Orbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of "In Dreams" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986),<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p191}} although Lynch has stated to the contrary that he and his producers obtained permission to use the song without speaking to Orbison in the first place.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXoqN6mPGPE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/GXoqN6mPGPE| archive-date=December 11, 2021|title=David Lynch on working with Roy Orbison |author=adamzanzie |website=youtube.com |date=September 5, 2019 |access-date=August 20, 2021 |url-status=live}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Lynch's first choice for a song had actually been "Crying";{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}} the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by Ben ([[Dean Stockwell]]), Booth's drug dealer boss, using an industrial work light as a pretend microphone, lighting his face.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=Dean Stockwell in 'Blue Velvet': The Movie That Made Him Timeless |url=https://variety.com/2021/film/columns/dean-stockwell-blue-velvet-quantum-leap-1235108606/ |work=Variety |date=November 9, 2021}}</ref> In later scenes, Booth demands the song be played repeatedly; also wanting the song while beating the protagonist.<ref>{{cite web |last=Oisin H.C |first=Toni |title=How 'Blue Velvet's Frank Booth Is an Allegory for Internalized Homophobia |url=https://collider.com/blue-velvet-frank-booth-toxic-masculinity/ |website=Collider |language=en |date=December 1, 2021}}</ref> During filming, Lynch would also sit his cast down every few hours and ask them to listen to the song.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p193}} Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, "I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'."<ref name="escott"/> The use of Orbison's song in the film greatly helped Orbison's comeback.<ref name="offbio" />

In 1987, Orbison released an album of re-recorded hits titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. "Life Fades Away", a song he co-wrote with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]] and recorded, was featured in the film ''[[Less than Zero (film)|Less than Zero]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |access-date=July 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archive-date=February 19, 2015 }}</ref> He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of "Crying" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987); the pair received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] after Orbison's death.<ref name="grammy">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=Grammy Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>

Also in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and was initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison."<ref name="clayson202-203">Clayson, Alan, pp. 202–203.</ref> In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt "validated" by the honor.<ref name="clayson202-203"/> After the awards, Orbison signed with [[Virgin Records]], who immediately released a "greatest hits" album and began preparing for an album of new songs.<ref name="offbio" />

A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]], [[JD Souther]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |access-date=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p207}} The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p205}} The concert is considered a landmark in Orbison's career.<ref name="offbio" />

The creation of the world's most recognized [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]],<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/supergroups-from-cream-and-traveling-wilburys-to-audioslave-and-chickenfoot-140540/cream-38577/ | title=Supergroups: From Cream and Traveling Wilburys to Audioslave and Chickenfoot | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=December 3, 2010 }}</ref> '''[[Traveling Wilburys]]''' began in 1987 when Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album.<ref name="offbio" /> Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p218}} By that evening, the group had written "[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself "Lefty Wilbury" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206–207.</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/traveling-wilburys-vol-1-103329/|title=Traveling Wilburys Volume One|first1=David|last1=Wild|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 18, 1988}}</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: "Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p221}}

Lynne later spoke of the recording sessions: "Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'&nbsp;... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 208.</ref> The band's debut album, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' (1988), was released on October 25, 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-traveling-wilburys-vol-1-mw0000787431|title=The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1 - The Traveling Wilburys &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|via=www.allmusic.com}}</ref> Orbison was given one solo track, "[[Not Alone Any More]]", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press.<ref name="grammy"/><ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p222}}
Orbison determinedly pursued his second chance at stardom, but he expressed amazement at his success: "It's very nice to be wanted again, but I still can't quite believe it."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p223}} He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, as well as the newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.<ref name=Pond/>

Orbison completed a solo comeback album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]'', in November 1988.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p227-8}} ''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison considered Lynne to be the best producer with whom he had ever collaborated.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p213}} [[Elvis Costello]], [[Bono]], Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name="britishhits"/>

Around November 1988, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p226}}. Orbison traveled to Europe and received an award at the Diamond Awards festival in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for "You Got It" was filmed.<ref name="offbio" /> He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule and became ill with a blinding headache during the final interview<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p226}}.

==Posthumous career==
Orbison's posthumous album ''Mystery Girl'' was released by [[Virgin Records]] on January 31, 1989<ref>{{Cite book|title=The authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Roy Jr.|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Alex,, Slate, Jeff|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|edition= Second|location=New York|page=235|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> and became the highest selling album of his career.<ref name="offbio" /> The biggest hit from ''Mystery Girl'' was "[[You Got It]]", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. "You Got It" rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name="britishhits"/> The song earned Orbison a posthumous Grammy Award nomination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/life_after_death_the_best_and_worst_posthumous_albums/s1__31845896|title=Life after death: The best and worst posthumous albums|date=November 16, 2020|website=Yardbarker}}</ref> According to ''Rolling Stone'', "Mystery Girl cloaks the epic sweep and grandeur of his classic sound in meticulous, modern production—the album encapsulates everything that made Orbison great, and for that reason it makes a fitting valedictory".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/mystery-girl-249142/|title=Mystery Girl|first1=Michael|last1=Azerrad|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 23, 1989}}</ref>

''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and No. 16 in the UK.

Although the video for the Traveling Wilburys' "Handle with Care" was filmed with Orbison, the video for "[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]" was filmed and released posthumously.

Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]], heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion.<ref>Lehman, p. 8.</ref> Few of Orbison's recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll.{{according to whom|date=July 2021}} Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, "He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth."<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as "the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]"<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p97}}<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> and "the Big O".<ref name="rollingstone.com"/>

===Song structures===
Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions "define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music".<ref>Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, "He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity".<ref name="watrous">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). "Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>

In the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like "Ooby Dooby" and "Claudette". Orbison's "In Dreams" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In "Running Scared", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. "Crying" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before "Only the Lonely", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name="nswhof">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>

{{blockquote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way.&nbsp;... So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes&nbsp;... But that's always after the fact—as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me. | Roy Orbison}}

[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made "radical left turns", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of "Running Scared" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, "Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p128}}

===Lyrical themes===
Critic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as "Go! Go! Go!" and "Mean Woman Blues" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70–71.</ref>

In 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: "Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy—try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention."<ref name="escott"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are "dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces".<ref name="watrous"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the "apocalyptic romanticism" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was "so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia", striking "a post-modern nerve".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: "The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically."<ref name="hall"/>

The loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely."<ref name="hall"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, "He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things&nbsp;... Before that no one would do it."<ref name="hall"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: "When ["Crying"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry."<ref name="hall"/>

===Voice quality===
{{Quote box
 | width = 30%
 | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time. All his vocal gymnastics were just a means to a powerful end, not a mission unto themselves. Roy Orbison didn't just sing beautifully—he sang brokenheartedly.
| source = —[[Stephen Thompson (journalist)|Stephen Thompson]], [[NPR]]<ref name="NPRsongswelove">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/28/135734524/roy-orbison-songs-we-love |title=Roy Orbison: Songs We Love |author=NPR staff |website=NPR |date=April 27, 2011 |access-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref>
}}

Orbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until "Only the Lonely" in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its "flowering".<ref>Lehman, p. 50.</ref> Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Jeanette MacDonald]] standard "[[Indian Love Call]]", and had the audience completely silenced, in awe.<ref>Lehman, p. 49.</ref> When compared to The Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with "a passionate intensity" that, according to ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', made "his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [seem] to be coming to an end—not with a whimper, but an agonised, beautiful bang".<ref name=decurtis155/>

Bruce Springsteen and [[Billy Joel]] both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison's voice. [[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like "the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard "Crying" for the first time, "That was it. To me that was the voice of God."<ref name="hall">Hall, Mark. (director) ''In Dreams: The Roy Orbison Story'', Nashmount Productions Inc., 1999.</ref> Elvis Presley stated Orbison's voice was the greatest and most distinctive he <!--check who 'they' are---> had ever heard.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p175,193}} Orbison's music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and songwriter [[Will Jennings]], among others.{{sfn|Lehman|ref=none|p=21}} Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence, remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s:<ref>Dylan, p. 33.</ref>{{Which|reason=Which source is this referring to?|date=October 2019}}

{{blockquote|With Roy, you didn't know if you were listening to mariachi or opera. He kept you on your toes. With him, it was all about fat and blood. He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop. [After "Ooby Dooby"] he was now singing his compositions in three or four octaves that made you want to drive your car over a cliff. He sang like a professional criminal&nbsp;... His voice could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, "Man, I don't believe it". | Bob Dylan}}

Likewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with "Crying" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: "The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p184}} Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, "Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it."<ref>Scheff, Jerry (2012). ''Way Down: Playing Bass with Elvis, Dylan, the Doors & More.'' Backbeat Books. p. 33.</ref>

His voice ranged from [[baritone]] to [[tenor]], and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range.<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Grady |first=Terence J. |date=February 2000 |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-02294.html |title=Orbison, Roy |website=American National Biography |url-access=subscription |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref>

Orbison's severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name="Lehman, p. 24">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.<ref>{{Citation|last=Townsend|first=Paul|title=Roy Orbison, March 1967, Colston Hall, Bristol|date=January 2, 2014|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/11707869923/|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref>

===Live performances===
[[File:Roy Orbison.jpg|thumb|250 px|Orbison, center (in white), performing in 1976]]
Orbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like "Mean Woman Blues" did offer that.<ref>Lehman, p. 62.</ref> He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, "I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like [[Chubby Checker]] or [[Bobby Rydell]] in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 78.</ref>

[[k.d. lang]] compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lang, k. d. |date=April 15, 2004 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |title=The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time: 37) Roy Orbison |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506004850/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |archive-date=May 6, 2009}}</ref> This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by [[John Belushi]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing "Oh, Pretty Woman", and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again.<ref name="Lehman, p. 24"/> However, Lang quantified this style by saying, "It's so hard to explain what Roy's energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence, but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there."<ref name="hall"/>

Orbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings playing the driving rhythm of western swing, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily with him. Orbison later reflected, "I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p7}}

'''Jiles Perry''' "'''J.P.'''" '''Richardson Jr.''' (October 24, 1930 – February 3, 1959), better known by his stage name '''The Big Bopper''', was an American musician and disc jockey. His best-known compositions include "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]," "[[Running Bear]]", and "[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]", the latter of which became [[George Jones]]'s first number-one hit in 1959. 

Richardson was [[The Day the Music Died|killed in an airplane crash]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], in February 1959, along with fellow musicians [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], and the pilot, Roger Peterson.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|title = 1959: Buddy Holly killed in air crash|publisher = BBC|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/3/newsid_2802000/2802541.stm|work = On This Day|accessdate = November 2, 2008 | date=February 3, 1959 | location=London}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Richardson was born on October 24, 1930, in [[Sabine Pass, Texas]], the oldest son of oil-field worker Jiles Perry Richardson (1905–84) and his wife Elise (née Stalsby) Richardson (1909–83). They had two other sons, Cecil (1934–89) and James (1932–2010). The family soon moved to [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Richardson graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and played on the "Royal Purple" American football team as a defensive lineman, wearing number 85.<ref>''Big Bopper: From Head Waiter To Rock'N'Roll Hero''. T Knight – Goldmine, 1989</ref> Richardson later was a radio [[disc jockey]] while at [[Lamar University|Lamar College]],<ref name=b&m /> where he studied prelaw and was a member of the band and chorus.

== Career ==
=== Radio ===
Richardson worked part-time at [[Beaumont, Texas]] radio station KTRM (now [[KZZB]]). He was hired by the station full-time in 1949 and quit college. Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou on April 18, 1952, and their daughter Debra Joy was born in December 1953, soon after Richardson was promoted to supervisor of announcers at KTRM. In March 1955, he was [[conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] and did his basic training at [[Fort Ord]], California. Richardson spent the rest of his two-year service as a radar instructor at [[Fort Bliss]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In March 1957, following his discharge as a corporal, Richardson returned to KTRM radio, where he held down the "Dishwashers' Serenade" shift from 11&nbsp;a.m. to 12:30&nbsp;p.m., Monday to Friday.

One of the station's sponsors wanted Richardson for a new time slot, and suggested an idea for a show. Richardson had seen college students doing a dance called The Bop, and he decided to call himself "The Big Bopper". His new radio show ran from 3:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m., and he soon became the station's program director. In May 1957, Richardson broke the record for continuous on-air broadcasting by eight minutes. He performed for a total of five days, two hours, and eight minutes from a remote setup in the lobby of the [[Jefferson Theatre]] in downtown Beaumont, playing 1,821 records<ref name=accuracy /> and taking showers during five-minute newscasts.<ref name="b&m">[https://www.bopperandme.co.uk/petition.php] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> Richardson is credited for creating the first music video in 1958, and recorded an early example himself.<ref name=accuracy>{{cite web|url=https://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Richardson,J.P.TheBigBopper.html|title=J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson|website=Accuracyproject.org|accessdate=January 21, 2007}}</ref>

=== Singer and songwriter ===
[[File:Big Bopper's Wedding - Little Red Riding Hood ad - Cash Box 1958.jpg|thumb|Advertisement featured in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine, 13 December 1958]] 
Richardson, who played guitar, began his musical career as a songwriter. [[George Jones]] later recorded Richardson's "[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]", which became Jones's first No. 1 country hit in 1959 (#73 on the pop charts). Richardson also wrote "[[Running Bear]]" for [[Johnny Preston]], his friend from [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. The inspiration for the song came from Richardson's childhood memory of the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]], where he heard stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes. Preston's recording was not released until August 1959, six months after Richardson's death. The song became a No. 1 hit for three weeks in January 1960. The man who launched Richardson as a recording artist was [[Pappy Daily|Harold "Pappy" Daily]] from [[Houston]]. Daily was promotion director for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] and [[Starday Records]] and signed Richardson to Mercury. Richardson's first single, "Beggar to a King", had a country flavor, but failed to gain any chart action.

Richardson soon cut "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" as "The Big Bopper"<ref name=pc14>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19763/m1/ |title= Show 14 – Big Rock Candy Mountain: Rock 'n' roll in the late fifties |show=14}}</ref> for Pappy Daily's [[D (record label)|D label]]. Mercury bought the recording and released it at the end of June 1958. It slowly began picking up airplay through July and August, and reached No. 6 on the pop chart spending 22 weeks in the national Top 40.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/98 98]|isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/98}}</ref> The disc sold in excess of one million copies by the end of 1958 and was awarded a [[music recording certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> In "Chantilly Lace", Richardson pretends to have a flirting phone conversation with his girlfriend;<ref name=pc14 /> the record was comical in nature, with The Big Bopper presenting an exaggerated, but good-natured caricature of a ladies' man. In November 1958, he scored a second hit, a raucous novelty tune entitled "The Big Bopper's Wedding", in which Richardson pretends to be getting [[cold feet]] at the altar. Both "Chantilly Lace" and "Big Bopper's Wedding" were receiving top 40 radio airplay through January 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=27496|title=ARSA – The Radio Surveys / Record Charts Site|first=Tim|last=Warden|website=Las-solanas.com|accessdate=February 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227231640/http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=27496|archive-date=February 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=13459|title=ARSA – The Radio Surveys / Record Charts Site|first=Tim|last=Warden|website=Las-solanas.com|accessdate=February 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227231704/http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=13459|archive-date=February 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Richardson was married to Adrianne Joy "Teetsie" Richardson Wenner (1936–2004) and had a daughter, Debra (1953–2006). His son, Jay Perry Richardson, was born two months after his death, in April 1959. Richardson had been building a recording studio in his home in [[Beaumont, Texas]], and was planning to invest in a radio station. Richardson had written 20 new songs that he planned to record himself or with other artists. His son also followed a musical career and was known professionally as "The Big Bopper, Jr.", performing around the world. He toured on the "Winter Dance Party" tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller on some of the same stages where his father had performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In January 2007, Jay Richardson requested that his father's body be exhumed and an autopsy be performed in response to an internet rumor about guns being fired aboard the aircraft and Richardson initially surviving the crash.<ref>{{cite news|title=Autopsy of 'Big Bopper' to Address Rumors About 1959 Plane Crash|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701976.html|website=Washingtonpost.com|date=January 18, 2007}}</ref> The autopsy was performed by [[William M. Bass]], a forensic anthropologist at the [[University of Tennessee]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. Richardson was present throughout the autopsy and observed the casket as it was opened; both men were surprised that the remains were well enough preserved to be recognized as those of the late rock star. "Dad still amazes me 48 years after his death, that he was in remarkable shape," Richardson told the Associated Press. "I surprised myself. I handled it better than I thought I would."<ref name="Rumors" /> Bass's findings indicated no signs of foul play. "There are fractures from head to toe. Massive fractures…. [Richardson] died immediately. He didn't crawl away. He didn't walk away from the plane."<ref name="Rumors">[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070307/ap_en_mu/big_bopper_autopsy;_ylt=AiuEThYrYavV4isgGgMkAfEDW7oF] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Richardson's body was placed in a new casket made by the same company as the original and was reburied next to his wife in Beaumont's Forest Lawn Cemetery. Jay Richardson allowed the old casket to be displayed at the [[Texas Musicians Museum]]. In December 2008, he announced that he would be placing the old casket up for auction on eBay, donating a share of the proceeds to the Texas Musicians Museum,<ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Franscell |url=http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/local/36759549.html |title=Big Bopper's casket a macabre marketable on eBay |newspaper=Beaumont Enterprise |date=December 27, 2008 |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> but Jay downplayed the suggestion in later interviews.<ref>{{cite news|first=Colin|last=Guy |url=http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/local/big_bopper_s_casket_may_not_appear_on_ebay_01-14-2009.html |title=Big Bopper's casket appears on eBay, but its not for sale |newspaper=Beaumont Enterprise |date=January 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> He died of heart failure in 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globegazette.com/news/local/jay-richardson-son-of-the-big-bopper-dies/article_27c84916-0a80-11e3-9633-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Jay Richardson, son of The Big Bopper, dies|first=Laura|last=Bird|newspaper=[[Mason City Globe Gazette]]}}</ref>
The family announced "It is with great sadness that we must tell you that Jay P Richardson has passed away. After a long hard fight, JP succumbed on the morning of August 21, at the age of 54".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.12newsnow.com/article/news/big-bopper-jr-54-passes-away/502-270089098|title=Big Bopper Jr., 54, passes away|website=12newsnow.com|date=August 31, 2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2021}}</ref>

[[C3 Entertainment]] handles the rights to the Richardson estate, through an agreement with Jay's widow Patty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c3entertainment.com/our-brands/big-bopper/|title=The Big Bopper|website=C3entertainment.com|access-date=September 14, 2019|archive-date=May 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513184843/http://www.c3entertainment.com/our-brands/big-bopper/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Death ==
{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2024}}[[File:Surf Ballroom Monument.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument in front of Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa]]

With the success of "Chantilly Lace", Richardson took time off from KTRM radio and joined [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and [[Dion and the Belmonts]] for a "[[Winter Dance Party]]" tour starting on January 23, 1959. On the 11th night of the tour (February 2, 1959), they played at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]]. That night, Holly chartered an airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]], intending to fly himself and his bandmates [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Tommy Allsup]] to their next tour venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. The musicians had been traveling by bus for over a week, and it had already broken down twice. They were tired, they had not been paid yet, and all of their clothes were dirty. The chartered flight would allow them to avoid another arduous bus ride, arrive early before the Moorhead show, do their laundry, and get some rest. Local pilot [[Roger Peterson (pilot)|Roger Peterson]] of Dwyer Flying Service (age 21) had agreed to take them. The weather forecast for the Clear Lake area was {{convert|18|°F|°C|abbr=on}} that night with moderate gusty winds and light scattered snow, and Peterson was fatigued from a 17-hour workday, but he agreed to fly the trip.

[[Frankie Sardo]] went to meet the crowd while Holly went into one of the dressing rooms at the Surf Ballroom where he notified Allsup and Jennings that he had chartered a plane to take them to [[Fargo, North Dakota]] (which is directly adjacent to Moorhead, Minnesota). On a friendly wager, Valens flipped a coin with Allsup for his seat on the plane—and won. Meanwhile, J.P. Richardson was suffering from the flu and was complaining that the bus was too cold and uncomfortable for him, so Jennings voluntarily surrendered his seat. Upon hearing that his bandmates had given away their plane seats, Holly joked, "Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up again." Jennings jokingly replied, "Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-how-waylon-jennings-survived-the-day-the-music-died-122992/ |title=Flashback: How Waylon Jennings Survived Buddy Holly Crash |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 3, 2015 }}</ref>

The Clear Lake show ended at around midnight and Holly, Valens, and Richardson drove to the Mason City Airport, loaded their luggage and boarded the red and white single-engine [[Beechcraft Bonanza]]. Peterson received clearance from the control tower around 12:55&nbsp;a.m. on February 3, 1959, and they took off—but the plane remained airborne for only a few minutes. It crashed at full throttle shortly after takeoff about 5 miles outside Mason City in the middle of farm country. The reason remains unknown but Peterson may have lost his visual reference and thought that he was ascending while he was actually descending. The right wingtip of the Bonanza hit the frozen ground and sent the aircraft cartwheeling across a cleared cornfield at approximately {{convert|170|mph}}.

Holly, Valens and Richardson were thrown from the airplane on impact and likely tumbled along with the wreckage across the icy field before the wreckage of the aircraft came to rest against a barbed-wire fence, while Peterson's body remained entangled in the wreckage. The bodies of Holly and Valens came to rest several feet away from the wreckage on open ground; Richardson was thrown approximately {{convert|100|feet}} beyond the wreckage across the fence line and into the next cornfield. All three died instantly of head and chest injuries. Richardson was 28 years old.

[[File:HollyMonument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument at crash site, September 16, 2003]]
In 1988, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s era, erected a stainless steel monument at the crash site depicting a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers. It is located on private farmland, about one-quarter-mile west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, about eight miles north of Clear Lake. Paquette also created a similar stainless steel monument to the three near the Riverside Ballroom in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. The memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jordan |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.articlestree.com/music/the-day-the-music-died-tx390707.html |title=The Day the Music Died |website=Articlestree.com |date=April 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207001836/http://www.articlestree.com/music/the-day-the-music-died-tx390707.html |archive-date=February 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

J.P. Richardson's pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. The Big Bopper is fondly remembered not only for his distinctive singing and songwriting, but also as a humorist who combined the best elements of country, R&B, and rock 'n' roll.

In 2010, Richardson was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |title=Big Bopper &#124; iowarocknroll |access-date=November 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627120647/https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Richardson's name is mentioned as one of the upcoming musical acts in both the print and television versions of [[Stephen King]]'s short story "[[You Know They Got a Hell of a Band]]" about a town inhabited by late musical legends. Buddy Holly is subsequently featured in the story.

The Canadian television comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' featured a character named "Sue Bopper-Simpson", a fictional daughter of the Big Bopper, played by [[Catherine O'Hara]]. The character was a part-time real estate agent who appeared in a musical titled ''I'm Taking My Own Head, Screwing It on Right, and No Guy's Gonna Tell Me That It Ain't''.

Shortly after the fatal plane crash, Tommy Dee wrote and recorded a song titled "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]" in tribute to Richardson, Holly, and Valens. It was later recorded by [[Eddie Cochran]], a friend of the three musicians who himself would die prematurely a year later in an automobile crash.

[[Van Halen]]'s song "Good Enough" from their 1986 album ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' begins with singer [[Sammy Hagar]] calling out "Hello Baby!", imitating the Big Bopper's hook in "Chantilly Lace". [[Phil Lewis (musician)|Phil Lewis]] of [[L.A. Guns]] does the same in their song "17 Crash" from their 1989 album ''[[Cocked & Loaded]]''.

The ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]" features a gravestone of The Big Bopper in Springfield that [[Sideshow Bob]] ([[Kelsey Grammer]]) used to help commit [[voter fraud]] and become elected for mayor. The gravestone is a bust of the Big Bopper holding a telephone receiver, with the epitaph reading "The Big Bopper", his birth and death years (1930–1959), then a parody on the memorable hook reading "Gooooodbye, baby". He also appeared as a vampire holding a telephone in an ''Itchy and Scratchy'' cartoon during the episode "[[C.E.D'oh]]".

An episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'' entitled "[[Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose]]" alludes to the deaths of [[Buddy Holly]] and the Big Bopper. The episode's title character, played by [[Peter Boyle]], explains that he had a ticket to see them perform the night after they died and received the psychic ability to predict people's deaths by calculating the odds that it took for the Big Bopper to be on the flight that killed him.

The Big Bopper's estate is currently owned by his daughter-in-law, Patty Richardson, and managed by [[C3 Entertainment]], a company that specializes in classic brands. C3 Entertainment currently manages an official [[tribute band]] featuring a Big Bopper impersonator, touring with the Winter Dance Party.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 2019, the Winter Dance Party debuted the film ''Bopper and Me.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://globegazette.com/entertainment/local_entertainment/the-big-bopper-documentary-premieres-in-clear-lake-this-weekend/article_36e993c1-89ff-5409-bb74-c9b5e0783138.html |title='The Big Bopper' documentary premieres in Clear Lake this weekend (with photos) &#124; Local Entertainment |website=Globegazette.com |date=January 30, 2019 |accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref>

'''The Blue Moon Boys''' were an American [[rock and roll]] band that was formed by [[Elvis Presley]], lead [[guitar]]ist [[Scotty Moore]] and [[double bass]] player [[Bill Black]]. The group members were introduced by [[Sun Studio]] owner [[Sam Phillips]] in 1954, except for drummer [[D.J. Fontana]], who joined the group during a [[Louisiana Hayride]] tour in 1955. The Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2007. The band was named after [[Bill Monroe|Bill Monroe's]] song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".

== Background ==
On July 18, 1953, [[Elvis Presley]] recorded a single at  [[Sun Studio]] as a gift for his [[Gladys Presley|mother]]'s birthday, the [[Ink Spots]]' "My Happiness", with "That's When Your Heartaches Begin" on the flipside.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| title=Where did Elvis Presley start his career?| publisher=elvislovemetender.com| access-date=2010-10-04| archive-date=2011-07-10| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710184750/http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| url-status=dead}}</ref>
Studio owner [[Sam Phillips]] was not there, so Presley's recording was managed by his secretary, [[Marion Keisker]], who kept a demo copy of the recording.<ref>Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-33225-9}}. Retrieved 2010-09-27.</ref>

At Phillips' behest Keisker called Presley for an appointment at the studio almost a year later; he returned on June 26, 1954.<ref name=Historyofrock>{{cite web | url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/sam_phillips_sun_records_two.htm| title=Sam Phillips' Sun Records| publisher=history-of-rock.com|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref> Although most of the session was not recorded, Phillips was impressed by Presley and introduced him to the [[country music]] band [[Starlight Wranglers]]' guitarist [[Scotty Moore]], who later introduced Presley to double bass player [[Bill Black]].<ref name=Hillbilly>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| title=Elvis Aaron Presley 1953-1955: The Hillbilly Cat.| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au| access-date=2010-09-27| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921184326/http://elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| archive-date=2010-09-21}}</ref>

== Sun recordings ==
On July 5, 1954, the trio headed to the Sun Studios for a recording test together. They recorded the songs "Harbor Lights" and "[[I Love You Because]]", and during a break they performed an impromptu version of [[Arthur Crudup]]'s "[[That's All Right]]", which impressed Phillips, who asked for a refinement of the interpretation that later was recorded.<ref name=Historyofrock/> 
Phillips played the recording for [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]]'s [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Dewey Phillips]], who played the song on his regular show next night, on July 8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lyrics.elvispresley.com.au/lyrics/thats_all_right_mama.html| title=That's Alright| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref>
On July 9, the trio recorded what became the flipside to "That's All Right", an uptempo [[rockabilly]] version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/show_pic.php?key=3318&type=ls | title=Rockin' Country Style| publisher=rcs-discography.com|access-date = 2010-09-27}}</ref>

[[Scotty Moore]] became the manager of the band, and they toured several cities in the south, the three members still working at their regular employments when not touring.<ref name=LastTrain>Guralnick, Peter.

The Blue Moon Boys appeared on a regular basis at Eagle's Nest club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elvisconcerts.com/liv1954.htm| title=1954.

'''The Everly Brothers''' were an American [[rock music|rock]] duo, known for [[steel-string acoustic guitar]] playing and [[close harmony]] singing. Consisting of [[Don Everly|Isaac Donald "Don" Everly]] and [[Phil Everly|Phillip "Phil" Everly]], the duo combined elements of [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]], and [[pop music|pop]],<ref name="Unterberger">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-everly-brothers-mn0000046699/biography |title=The Everly Brothers |last=Unterberger |first=Richie   |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref> becoming pioneers of [[country rock]].<ref name=RecordCollector/><ref name=Hoffman/>

The duo was raised in a musical family, first appearing on radio in Iowa singing with their father Ike Everly and mother Margaret Everly as "The Everly Family" in the 1940s, and in Knoxville, Tennessee, while the brothers were in high school.  They gained the attention of [[Chet Atkins]], who began to promote them for national attention.

They began writing and recording their own music in 1956, and their first hit song came in 1957, with "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]," written by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]]. The song hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957, and additional hits would follow through 1958, many of them written by the Bryants, including "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]," "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]," and "[[Problems (The Everly Brothers song)|Problems]]." In 1960, they signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded "[[Cathy's Clown]]," written by the brothers themselves, which was their biggest selling single. The brothers enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in 1961 and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962, with "[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)]]" being their last top-10 hit.

Long-simmering disputes with [[Wesley Rose]], the CEO of [[Acuff-Rose Music]], which managed the group, and increased drug use in the 1960s, as well as changing tastes in popular music, led to the duo's decline in popularity in its native U.S., though the brothers continued to release hit singles in the U.K. and Canada and had many highly successful tours throughout the 1960s. In the early 1970s, the brothers began releasing solo recordings, and in 1973 they officially broke up. Starting in 1983, the brothers got back together and continued to perform periodically until Phil's death in 2014. Don died seven years later.

The group had a major influence on the music of the generation that followed it. Many of the top acts of the 1960s were heavily influenced by the close-harmony singing and acoustic guitar playing of the Everly Brothers including [[the Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]], the [[Bee Gees]], and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the Everly Brothers No. 1 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=December 17, 2015|title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/1-the-everly-brothers-239717/|access-date=September 6, 2020|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as part of the inaugural class of 1986 and into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2001. Don was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2019, earning the organization's first Iconic Riff Award for his distinctive rhythm guitar intro to the Everlys' massive 1957 hit "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/musicians-hall-of-fame-2019-inductees-alabama-don-everly-859832/ |title=Alabama, Don Everly Set for Musicians Hall of Fame |author=Stephen L.

While in Knoxville the brothers found work performing on [[Cas Walker]]’s Farm and Home Hour, a regional radio and TV variety program, before the brothers caught the attention of family friend [[Chet Atkins]], manager of the [[RCA Victor]] studios in Nashville.<ref>“Everly Brothers' mother, 99, recalls Bearden, Cas Walker and the ducktails,” Knoxville News Sentinel, February 21, 2019</ref> Shortly thereafter their mother moved the family to Nashville.<ref name="Lazell p. 171">Lazell, Barry ed., with Dafydd Rees and Luke Crampton, ''Rock Movers & Shakers''.

Atkins introduced the Everly Brothers to [[Wesley Rose]], of [[Acuff-Rose]] music publishers. Rose told them he would secure them a recording deal if they signed to Acuff-Rose as songwriters. They signed in late 1956, and in 1957 Rose introduced them to [[Archie Bleyer]],<ref>Alan Frazer, "The Everly Saga, $$."

Working with the Bryants, they had hits in the United States and the United Kingdom, the biggest being "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]", "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]", "[[Bird Dog (song)|Bird Dog]]", and "[[Problems (The Everly Brothers song)|Problems]]". The Everlys, though they were largely interpretive artists, also succeeded as songwriters, especially with Don's "[[(Till) I Kissed You]]", which hit No.&nbsp;4 on the US pop charts.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', Billboard Books, NY 1992, p. 165.</ref>

The brothers toured with [[Buddy Holly]] in 1957 and 1958. According to Holly's biographer Philip Norman, they were responsible for persuading Holly and the [[the Crickets|Crickets]] to change their outfits from [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] and [[T-shirt]]s to the Everlys' [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League]] suits.

After three years on Cadence, the Everlys signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1960,<ref name="AMG" /> where they recorded for 10 years. Their first Warner Bros. hit, 1960's "[[Cathy's Clown]]", which they wrote and composed themselves, sold eight million copies and became the duo's biggest-selling record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077x1fh|title=The Everly Brothers: Harmonies from Heaven|website=BBC|access-date=September 11, 2021}}</ref> "Cathy's Clown" was number WB1, the first selection Warner Bros.

Other successful Warner Bros. singles followed in the United States, such as "[[So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)]]" (1960, pop No.&nbsp;7), "[[Walk Right Back]]" (1961, pop No.&nbsp;7), "[[Crying in the Rain]]" (1962, pop No.&nbsp;6), and "[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)|That's Old Fashioned]]" (1962, pop No.&nbsp;9, their last top 10 hit). From 1960 to 1962, Cadence Records released Everly Brothers singles from the vaults, including "[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]" (pop No.&nbsp;8), written and composed by Phil, and "[[Like Strangers]]".<ref name="ebmf">{{cite web|url=https://musicfinder.online/the-everly-brothers/|title=The Everly Brothers |website=Music Finder| date=September 10, 2014 |access-date=September 16, 2021}}</ref>

In the UK, they had 18 singles into the top 40 with Warner Bros. in the 1960s, including a string of top 10 hits through 1965 that featured "[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]"/"So Sad" (1960, No.&nbsp;4), "Walk Right Back"/"[[Ebony Eyes (John D. Loudermilk song)|Ebony Eyes]]" (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]" (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "Cryin' in the Rain" (1962, No.&nbsp;6) and "[[The Price of Love]]" (1965, No.&nbsp;2).

By 1962, records by the Everlys had reportedly generated $35 million in sales.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trigger|date=January 4, 2014|url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/how-music-row-acuff-rose-killed-the-everly-brothers/|title=How Music Row & Acuff-Rose Killed The Everly Brothers/|website=Saving Country Music.com|access-date=September 16, 2021}}</ref> In 1961, the brothers had a falling out with Wesley Rose during the recording of "Temptation". Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he had not published and, hence, for which he would not be paid any publishing royalties. Rose made efforts to block the record's release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s, they were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written and composed most of their hits, as well as the Everlys themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. From 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other composers to avoid paying any royalties to Acuff-Rose. They used the pseudonym "Jimmy Howard" as writer or arranger on two selections they wrote and recorded during this time. This ruse, however, was ultimately unsuccessful, as Acuff-Rose gained legal possession of the copyrights once the deception was discovered.<ref name="alca">{{cite web|url=https://alancackett.com/phil-everly/|title=Phil Everly|website=Alan Cackett |access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref>
Around this time, the brothers also set up their own record label, Calliope Records, for solo projects. Using the pseudonym "Adrian Kimberly", Don recorded a big-band instrumental version of [[Edward Elgar]]'s first "[[Pomp and Circumstance]]" march, which [[Neal Hefti]] arranged and which charted in the United States top 40 in mid-1961. Further instrumental singles credited to Kimberly followed, but none of those charted. Phil formed the Keestone Family Singers, which featured [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Carole King]]. Their lone single, "Melodrama", failed to chart, and by the end of 1962, Calliope Records had gone out of business.
The Everly Brothers' last United States top 10 hit was 1962's "That's Old Fashioned (That's The Way Love Should Be)", a song recorded but unreleased by [[The Chordettes]] and given to the brothers by their old mentor, Archie Bleyer.<ref name="ebmf"/>

In succeeding years the Everly Brothers sold fewer records in the United States. Their enlistments in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in October 1961 took them out of the spotlight.<ref>Natalie Best. "Rock 'n' Roll Marine Weds With Brother As Best Man".

Following their discharges from active duty, the Everlys resumed their career, but with little success in the United States. Of their 27 singles on Warner Bros. from 1963 through 1970, only three made the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and none peaked higher than No.&nbsp;31. Album sales were also down. The Everlys' first two albums for Warners (in 1960 and 1961) peaked at No.&nbsp;9 US, but after that, of a dozen more LPs for Warner Bros., only one made the top 200 – 1965's "[[Beat & Soul]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;141.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nysmusic.com/2021/08/23/don-everly-1937-2021/|last=O'Shea|first=Tim|date=August 23, 2021|title=Don Everly, 1937–2021|website=NYS Music|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-everly-brothers/chart-history/tlp/|title=Chart History: The Everly Brothers – Beat & Soul|magazine=Billboard|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref>

The Everlys' dispute with Acuff-Rose lasted until 1964, when they resumed writing and composing as well as working with the Bryants. By then, however, both of the brothers were addicted to [[amphetamine]]s. Don's condition was worse, as he was taking [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]]; his [[addiction]] lasted three years, until he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and was hospitalized for treatment.<ref name="RSEncyc">''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Simon & Schuster, 2001)</ref> The mainstream media did not report either brothers' addiction.

Though their U.S. stardom had begun to wane two years before the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, their appeal was still strong in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The Everlys remained successful in the United Kingdom and Canada for most of the 1960s, reaching the top 40 in the United Kingdom through 1968 and the top 10 in Canada as late as 1967. The 1966 album ''[[Two Yanks in England]]'' was recorded in England with [[the Hollies]], who also wrote many of the album's songs. The Everlys' final U.S. top 40 hit, "[[Bowling Green (song)|Bowling Green]]", was released in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-everly-brothers-don-everly-dies-at-84/|last1=Kim|last2=Bloom|first1=Michelle Hyun|first2=Madison|date=August 22, 2021|title=The Everly Brothers' Don Everly Dies at 84|website=Pitchfork|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref>

By the end of the 1960s, the brothers had returned to country rock, and their 1968 album, ''[[Roots (The Everly Brothers album)|Roots]]'', was hailed by some retrospective critics as "one of the finest early country-rock albums".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6937|pure_url=yes}}|title=Roots The Everly Brothers|publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref> However, by the end of the 1960s, the Everly Brothers had ceased to be hitmakers in either North America or the UK, and in 1970, following an unsuccessful live album (''The Everly Brothers Show''), their ten-year contract with Warner Bros. lapsed. They were the summer replacement hosts for [[Johnny Cash]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] television show in 1970; their variety program, ''Johnny Cash Presents the Everly Brothers'', featured [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>"Everly Brothers Return". Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'', July 5, 1970, p. 29E.</ref>

In 1970, Don released his first solo album, which was unsuccessful. The brothers resumed performing in 1971 and issued two albums for [[RCA Records]] in 1972 and 1973. [[Lindsey Buckingham]] joined and toured with them in 1972. The Everlys announced their final performance would take place on July 14, 1973, at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park]], California, but tensions between the two surfaced and Don told a reporter he was tired of being an Everly Brother.<ref>Marilyn and Hy Gardner, "Everly Brothers Too Close for Too Long".

===Solo years (1973–1983)===
Phil and Don pursued solo careers from 1973 to 1983. Don found some success on the US country charts in the mid- to late-1970s, in Nashville with his band, Dead Cowboys, and playing with [[Albert Lee]]. Don also performed solo at an annual country music festival in London in mid-1976. His appearance was well received, and he was given "thunderous applause", even though critics noted that the performance was uneven.<ref>Ed Blanche, "Everly Laid Back". Springfield (MA) Union, June 21, 1977, p. 26.</ref>

Phil recorded more frequently, but with no chart success until the 1980s. He wrote "Don't Say You Don't Love Me No More" for the 1978 [[Clint Eastwood]] comedy film ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'', which he performed as a duet with the film's co-star [[Sondra Locke]]. Phil also wrote "One Too Many Women In Your Life" for the 1980 sequel, ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', and played in the band which backed Locke.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/05/phil-everly|last=Sweeting|first=Adam|date=January 5, 2014|title=Phil Everly obituary – Half of the brilliant duo that transformed 1950s pop music|website=The Guardian|access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref>

===Reunion, subsequent activities (1983–2006)===
The brothers' reunion concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]] on September 23, 1983, which ended their ten-year-long solo careers, was initiated by Phil and Don alongside Terry Slater, with Wingfield as musical director.

Newark (NJ) Star-Ledger, January 6, 1984, p. 38.</ref> The brothers returned to the studio as a duo for the first time in over a decade, recording the album ''EB '84'', produced by [[Dave Edmunds]]. The lead single, "[[On the Wings of a Nightingale]]", written by [[Paul McCartney]], was a success (Top 10 adult contemporary)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/eb-84-mw0000189823/awards |title=EB 84 – The Everly Brothers &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 5, 2014}}</ref> and returned them to the US Hot 100 (for their last appearance) and the UK charts.

Their final charting single was 1986's "[[Born Yesterday (song)|Born Yesterday]]", from the album of the same name. They collaborated with other performers, mostly singing either backup vocals or duets, including additional vocals on the title track of [[Paul Simon]]'s 1986 album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]''. In 1990, Phil recorded a duet with Dutch singer [[René Shuman]]. "On Top of the World" was written and composed by Phil, who appeared in the music video they recorded in Los Angeles. The selection appeared on Shuman's album ''Set the Clock on Rock''. A 1981 live [[BBC]] recording of "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]", which featured Cliff Richard and Phil sharing vocals, was a UK Top 20 hit in 1994.<ref name="Sleeve notes from 'All I Have to Do Is Dream' single">{{cite AV media notes | title='All I Have to Do Is Dream' (single)| author=Cliff Richard with Phil Everly|date=1994| publisher=EMI| location=United Kingdom}}</ref>

As a tribute to the Everly Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel opened their own show and had the Everlys come out in the middle of it. The live album ''[[Old Friends: Live on Stage]]'' contains Simon & Garfunkel discussing the Everlys' influence on their career and features all four on "Bye Bye Love"; the subsequent DVD features two extra solo performances by the Everlys.

Don Everly claimed in a 2014 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that he had given up smoking in the late 1960s and that Phil had stopped too, but started again during their breakup and had continued until 2001. Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]]. He admitted that he had lived "a very difficult life" with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something that was mainly attributed to "their vastly different views on politics and life", with the music being the one thing they shared closely, saying, "it's almost like we could read each other's minds when we sang." However, Don also stated he had not gotten over Phil's death, saying, "I always thought about him every day, even when we were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he's gone."

'''The Jordanaires''' were an [[Americans|American]] vocal quartet that formed as a [[Gospel music|gospel]] group in 1948. Over the years, they recorded both sacred and secular music for recording companies such as [[Capitol Records]], [[RCA Victor]], [[Columbia Records]], [[Decca Records]], [[Vocalion Records]], Stop Records, and many other smaller independent labels.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

In the mid-1950s, with a lineup of Gordon Stoker (first tenor), Neal Matthews (second tenor and lead vocals), Hoyt Hawkins (baritone and lead vocals), and Hugh Jarrett (bass vocals), they also began lending their vocal talents to other artists as background singers in recording sessions.  They are widely known for having provided background vocals for [[Elvis Presley]] in live appearances, recordings, and feature films from 1956 to 1970. Jarrett was replaced by then-teacher [[Ray Walker (singer)|Ray Walker]] in 1958. The group worked in the recording studio, on stage, and on television with many [[Country music|country]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[Rock music|rock and roll]] artists.

They also provided background vocals using the names the Gordonaires (a play on the name of the group's first tenor Gordon Stoker), the Merry Melody Singers, and the Almanac Singers, sometimes using different personnel.

==Group history==
===Early years===

The group was formed by brothers Monty and Bill Matthews, both of whom were evangelists, in the late 1940s.<ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1">{{cite web |last1=Rumble |first1=John |title=Jordanaires |url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jordanaires |website=Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum |access-date=August 22, 2024}}</ref>  The original lineup included Bill Matthews, Monty Matthews, Bob Hubbard (baritone), Culley Holt (bass vocals), soon joined by pianist Bob Money.<ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>  By 1949, the group members had moved from [[Springfield, Missouri]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>  <!-- edit here: In 1948, Monty and Bill Matthews left. Hawkins switched to baritone, and new lead [[Neal Matthews]] was recruited. Don Bruce came in as a new first tenor, but he was drafted the next year. The group narrowed to a quartet, with Gordon Stoker taking over as first tenor. -->  

They became members of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1949,<ref>{{cite web| title = Opry Timeline – 1940s| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1940.html| website = Opry.com| access-date = July 6, 2012| archive-date = March 17, 2017| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170317065341/http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1940.html| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name="Rovi">{{cite web | title = The Jordanaires | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-jordanaires-mn0000087113 | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | date = 2012 | access-date = July 6, 2012}}</ref> where they frequently provided harmony and backing vocals for Opry "headliner" [[Red Foley]].<ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>  In the early 1950s, the group featured many lineup changes. Pianist Bob Money was replaced by Gordon Stoker, and founding members Bill and Monty Matthews left the group and moved back to Missouri.<ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>  Stoker began singing with the group, taking on lead vocal and tenor roles, and new members [[Neal Matthews, Jr.]] (second tenor, and unrelated to Bill and Monty Matthews), Hoyt Hawkins (baritone), and Hugh Jarrett (bass vocals) joined in the early-to-mid-1950s.<ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>

Sister Rosetta Tharpe toured with the vocal group the Jordanaires in the late forties and early fifties, one of the first multiracial gospel pairings.

They recorded for [[Capitol Records]] in the early 1950s, and began providing vocal accompaniment behind solo singers in Nashville, Tennessee.<ref name="Rovi" /><ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>

The quartet became well known in the Southern gospel genre, and what made them stand out from other quartets of that time was how they would bring [[spirituals]] (such as "Dry Bones") to a predominantly white audience. While continuing to turn out gospel albums of their own, the group became better known for the signature background harmonies they provided on dozens of secular records.<ref name=CMT>{{cite web|title=Jordanaires Biography|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/jordanaires/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040731212016/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/jordanaires/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 31, 2004|website=Cmt.com|access-date=11 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>

In the late 1950s, member Neal Matthews, Jr. created the [[Nashville Number System]] for the Jordanaires (and the [[Nashville A-Team]]) to use to make recording easier and simplify any potential key changes during recording.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nashville Number System |author= Chas Williams|url=https://nashvillenumbersystem.com/|access-date=January 21, 2023|website=nashvillenumbersystem.com}}</ref><ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref>

===Elvis Presley===

According to the Jordanaires' website, in 1955, they first met musician Elvis Presley, a fan of the group, backstage after a concert in Memphis, Tennessee with Eddy Arnold; at the time, Presley was signed to the Memphis-based label Sun Records.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>  During this meeting, Presley told the group that he would like them to sing backup for him if he ever was signed to a major record label.  Stoker later stated that the group "[wished] Elvis well, 'But we never expected to hear from him again,' ... 'People were always coming up and saying that. We're still told that.'"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>

After Elvis' contract was sold to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor Records]], he and his band [[the Blue Moon Boys]] (lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]], [[double bass]]ist [[Bill Black]], and drummer [[D. J. Fontana]]) had their first RCA sessions in January 1956.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>  His co-producer, guitarist [[Chet Atkins]], recruited Stoker to sing backup for "a 'new-probably-wouldn't-be-around-long kid, named Elvis Presley'".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>    Instead of recruiting all of the Jordanaires, as Presley had wanted, Chet Atkins hired Ben and Brock Speer of the vocal group the Speer Family, who had also recently signed to RCA, to sing with Stoker.  Elvis, his band, Stoker, and Ben and Brock Speer, recorded  "I Was The One" (the B-side of "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]") in January and "[[I Want You, I Need You, I Love You]]" in April.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>  After the April session, Presley asked Stoker if the full group could join him in the studio for the next sessions.  Stoker arranged this, and the full group began working with Presley shortly afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>  They continued recording (and touring) with Presley regularly until 1968, and sporadically rejoined him for some sessions in 1970 and 1971.

===Patsy Cline===
The group appeared on all of [[Patsy Cline]]'s [[Decca Records|Decca]] sessions from her first in November 1960 to her last in February 1963, during which time they backed her on songs such as:

===After Elvis and Cline===

According to the Jordanaires' official website, in 1976 and 1979, [[The Recording Academy|the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] gave the group the "Superpickers" award "for having sung on more Top 10 discs than any other vocal group in history."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>  

The group's lineup changed again in 1982, when Hoyt Hawkins died. His replacement was Duane West,<ref name="Jordanaires CMHOF 1"></ref> formerly of [[Sonny James]]' backup group, the Southern Gentlemen, who had filled in for Hawkins on numerous occasions in the 1970s when Hawkins had been ill.

In 1984, they received the "'CMA Masters Award' for their lifetime contribution of music" from the Country Music Association.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jordanaires Biography |url=http://www.jordanaires.net/about/us.htm |website=The Jordanaires |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>

In 1990, the group provided backing vocals for Presley's former Sun Records labelmate [[Johnny Cash]] on his [[Mercury Records]] album ''[[Boom Chicka Boom]]''. The group also recorded with the Swedish group [[Vikingarna (band)|Vikingarna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article10427694.ab|title=Vikingarna tar farväl av fansen|website=Aftonbladet.se|language=sv|author=Linda Hjertén|date=22 January 2004|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>

===Later years and deaths===

The band also owns and operates its own record label Oh Wow Dang Records. The band entered into a hiatus in 2016.

Lead singer Jessi Zazu died from cancer on September 12,  2017.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/those-darlins-jessi-zazu-dead-at-28/|title=Those Darlins' Jessi Zazu Dead at 28|last=Strauss|first=Matthew|date=13 September 2017|accessdate=13 September 2017|website=Pitchfork}}</ref>

==History==
===Origin===
[[File:Those Darlins 0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|Those Darlins performing in San Diego in 2014]]
Jessi Zazu, Nikki Kvarnes, and Kelley Anderson formed Those Darlins after meeting at the Southern Girls Rock & Roll Camp in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infiniteshuffle.com/2010/03/28/those-darlins|title=21 – Those Darlins|date=28 March 2010 |publisher=Infiniteshuffle.com|accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

They began by covering [[Carter Family]] songs<ref>{{cite web|last=Shapiro|first=Benjamin|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/carter-family|title=The Carter Family Derides Marriage And Ups The Single Ladies|publisher=Noisey.vice.com|date=2011-04-17|accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> and employed traditional southern instrumentation, including [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] and [[clogging]], as well as less traditional instruments like the [[baritone ukulele]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVIZBQVEAjg|title=Those Darlins - Keep My Skillet Good and Greasy|publisher=YouTube.com|date=2011-11-21|accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> The three adopted the [[stage name]] Darlin, a practice that continued until Anderson's departure in 2012.

They released their first single "Wild One" in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11104-wild-one|title=Tracks|publisher=Pitchfork.com|date=2009-03-12|accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> Soon after, [[Dan Auerbach]] from [[The Black Keys]] asked the band to open on his U.S. solo tour, raising the band's profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hearya.com/2008/12/06/those-darlins|title=Introducing Those Darlins, touring w/ Dan Auerbach|publisher=Hearya.com|date=2008-12-06|accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

===''Those Darlins'' (self-titled)===
The band entered the studio with Jeff Curtin of [[Small Black]] (who had worked previously on [[Vampire Weekend]]'s [[Vampire Weekend (album)|self-titled album]]) to record their debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jeff+Curtin |title=Jeff Curtin Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> The album mixes the [[appalachian music|Appalachian]] and [[alternative country|alt-country]] sounds they were known for with [[rockabilly]] and rock and roll sensibilities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bonfiglio |first=Jeremy D. |url=http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/record-review-those-darlins |title=Record Review - Those Darlins - Those Darlins (self titled debut) Oh Wow Dang Records |publisher=Nodepression.com |date=2015-04-26 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> The first single from the album, "Red Light Love", would be used in a national commercial for the [[Kia Sorento]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2011/06/20/those-darlins-red-light-love-fuels-new-kia-tv-spot/ |title=Those Darlins' 'Red Light Love' fuels new Kia TV spot &#124; Music &#124; The Tennessean |publisher=Blogs.tennessean.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

In support of their self-titled album, the band toured alongside a number of rock acts, such as [[Dr. Dog]], [[The Features]], [[The King Khan & BBQ Show]] and [[JEFF the Brotherhood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highroadtouring.com/artists/those-darlins-2/itinerary/ |title=Those Darlins |publisher=Highroadtouring.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

===''Screws Get Loose''===
After touring together behind their debut album, the band asked long-time drummer Linwood Regensburg to join the band as an official member and songwriting partner.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schultz |first=Ben |url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/tennessee-band-those-darlins-have-a-few-loose-screws/Content?oid=2437229 |title=Tennessee Band Those Darlins Have a Few Loose Screws &#124; The family that isn't a family &#124; Music |publisher=Boiseweekly.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> The four-piece went into the studio in 2011 to record their follow-up album, again with Jeff Curtin producing, but this time engineered by Ed Rawls, known for his work with [[garage rock]]-leaning Atlanta bands such as [[Black Lips]] and early [[Deerhunter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ed%20Rawls |title=Ed Rawls Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

With these influences, the band's sophomore record ''Screws Get Loose'' adopted an aggressive garage rock sound which [[Robert Christgau]] of NPR and ''The Village Voice'' called "hooky, saucy, punky songwriting in a mood somewhere between [[Be Your Own Pet]] and [[The Donnas]], only savvier".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=those+darlins |title=CG: those darlins |publisher=Robertchristgau.com |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> In support of the album, the band released music videos for singles "Screws Get Loose"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tzfzN0MyhU |title=Those Darlins - 'Screws Get Loose' (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO) HD |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> and "Be Your Bro".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiyXjv1aaf8 |title=Those Darlins - 'Be Your Bro' (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO) |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-01-23 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> The band toured alongside [[Best Coast]], [[Drive-By Truckers]] and [[Old 97's]] in the U.S..<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highroadtouring.com/artists/those-darlins-2/itinerary/all/ |title=Those Darlins |publisher=Highroadtouring.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> and went on their first European Tour in early 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thosedarlins.com/uk-screws-get-loose-is-out-today-european-tour-dates/ |title=UK: Screws Get Loose is out today & European Tour Dates |publisher=Those Darlins |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

===Departure of Kelley Anderson===
In February 2012, Those Darlins announced that founding member Kelley Anderson would be leaving the band to pursue other musical projects and professional ventures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thosedarlins.com/those-darlins-announce-the-departure-of-kelley-anderson-recording-upcoming-ep-with-scott-litt/ |title=Announce The Departure of Kelley Anderson // Recording Upcoming Ep With Scott Litt |publisher=Those Darlins |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> She would eventually be replaced by bassist Adrian Barrera, who had toured with the band previously while a member of Gentlemen Jesse & His Men.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Bobby |url=https://creativeloafing.com/content-152162-adrian-barrera-joins-those-darlins |title=Adrian Barrera joins Those Darlins |publisher=Clatl.com |date=2013-04-01 |access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Vrabel |first=Ani |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/those-darlins-the-strange-boys-gentleman-jesse-ann.html |title=Those Darlins, Strange Boys, Gentleman Jesse Announce Tour :: Blogs :: :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

===''Blur the Line''===
In early 2013, Those Darlins returned to the studio to work on their third album, this time recording in their hometown of Nashville with producer Roger Moutenot ([[Yo La Tengo]], [[John Cale]], [[JEFF the Brotherhood]]). Before officially announcing the album, the band hung up a banner of the cover art, which features the nude legs and torsos of the four members of the band, in front of Nashville record store Grimey's New & Preloved Music. Local [[WZTV]] ran a story on the banner,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3hDDcSdSs8 |title=Mystery banner at Grimey's causes Fox News to warn |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2013-07-25 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> which caused controversy among those concerned with the display of the image on a well-trafficked street.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151734266957290&set=a.10150258659942290.343029.73949382289&type=1 |title=Timeline Photos - WZTV FOX 17 News, Nashville |publisher=Facebook.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> The band took credit for the image but claimed that the controversy it sparked was unintentional.

Soon after, ''Paste'' magazine announced that band's album ''Blur the Line'' would be released on 1 October,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hurston |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/07/exclusive-those-darlins-announce-third-studio-albu.html |title=Those Darlins Announce Third Album, Blur The Line :: Music :: News :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> and shared videos for the first two singles, "Oh God"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHR1PcfVGSc |title=Those Darlins - OH GOD (Official Video) |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> and "Optimist".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWfc4yiN_k0 |title=Those Darlins - Optimist |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> ''SPIN'' called ''Blur the Line'' "tough and seductive"<ref>{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Dan |url=https://www.spin.com/2013/09/those-darlins-blur-the-line-oh-wow-dang-records-album-stream/ |title=Stream Those Darlins' Tough and Seductive 'Blur the Line' |publisher=SPIN.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref> while '''Blurt'' wrote that "songwriting/arranging this masterful elevates ''Blur the Line'' to modern-classic status".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mills |first=Fred |url=http://blurtonline.com/review/those-darlins-blur-the-line/ |title=THOSE DARLINS – Blur the Line - Blurt Magazine |publisher=Blurtonline.com |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>

===Hiatus===
On December 9, 2015, the band announced on its Facebook page, that they were going on hiatus. "We're here to deliver some unfortunate news... Those Darlins will be taking an indefinite hiatus effective after our final tour in January. We've had a really great run together, but the time has come for us to move in different directions. We really appreciate all the love and support from our friends, fans, and family over the years."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thosedarlins/posts/10153130968731059:0|title=Those Darlins Facebook Page|date=December 18, 2015|website =Facebook.com |access-date=December 18, 2015}}</ref> On March 17, 2016, Those Darlins played their last show ever at Baby's All Right in [[Brooklyn]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Isenhart|first=Olivia |url=http://pancakesandwhiskey.com/2016/03/21/those-darlins-nail-their-last-show-ever-at-babys-all-right/ |title=Those Darlins Nail Their Last Show Ever at Baby's All Right |publisher=pancakesandwhiskey.com |date=2016-03-21 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Turner merged sound and movement at a critical turning point in rock history, navigating and reflecting back the technological innovations of a new pop-music era in the 60s and 70s. She catapulted herself to the forefront of a musical revolution that had long marginalized and overlooked the pioneering contributions of African American women and then remade herself again at an age when most pop musicians were hitting the oldies circuit. Turner's musical character has always been a charged combination of mystery as well as light, melancholy mixed with a ferocious vitality that often flirted with danger.}}

Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] "The Queen of Rockabilly". She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.

Jackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song "[[You Can't Have My Love]]". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including "[[Fujiyama Mama]]", "Mean Mean Man" and the top 40 hit "[[Let's Have a Party]]".

In the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included "[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]", "[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]", "[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]" and "[[A Woman Lives for Love]]". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single "[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.

In 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, ''[[Encore (2021 Wanda Jackson album)|Encore]]'', in 2021.

==Early life==
Jackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name="Oklahoma">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver. He also played music in a local band alongside his brother.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=1-5}} Because of limited opportunities in Maud, the family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1941.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=7}} Jackson often sang alongside her parents at home. Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}

In the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: "All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still," she recounted in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}

In Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends. She was featured on program, which impressed the station's disc jockey, who encouraged her to audition for a second KPLR contest.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=33-34}} Jackson won the second contest at KPLR, which allotted Jackson her own 15-minute radio segment.<ref name="allmusic"/> On the show, Jackson performed a set of country songs and recalled having little understanding of how to host a radio show. "I was flying by the seat of my pants, but it didn't scare me to get out on a limb and try something brand new. I liked it," she explained in her biography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=36-38}}

As a teenager, Jackson attended [[Capitol Hill High School]] in Oklahoma City<ref name="Oklahoman">{{cite news |last1=Willert |first1=Tim |title=Singer Wanda Jackson among alumni to be honored by Oklahoma City school foundation |url=https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |access-date=9 July 2021 |publisher=[[The Oklahoman]] |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184754/https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |url-status=live }}</ref> and continued her radio show.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=44}} She also dated fellow student, Leonard Sipes, who would later go by the name [[Tommy Collins (singer)|Tommy Collins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=45-46}} In 1952, Jackson was heard on the air by country singer and local resident, [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The singer invited Jackson to perform with him at the Trianon Ballroom in Oklahoma City. On Thompson's show, Jackson sang "Blue Yodel No. 6" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. "[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar – that's all she thought about," a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}

==Career==
===1953–1955: Country beginnings===
Jackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. "Girls don't sell records!" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: "I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}

[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]
Instead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, "[[You Can't Have My Love]]". Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled "If You Don't Somebody Else Will". Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard" />{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}

Instead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Jackson also did her first performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] while in town.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=69-70}} For the performance, her mother made a dress fitted with [[spaghetti strap]]s and a [[neckline|sweetheart neckline]]. Host [[Ernest Tubb]] told her it was unacceptable, so she covered it with a fringe jacket. She later recalled hearing fellow Opry members making negative comments about her while she was onstage.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Carrigan |first1=Henry |title=THE READING ROOM: Wanda Jackson's Stories Assure 'I'm Still Here' |journal=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |date=April 4, 2019 |url=https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |access-date=12 July 2021 |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712014844/https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |url-status=live }}</ref> "I decided that night that the ''Grand Ole Opry'' scene was not for me," she recounted.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=chapter 6}}

In 1955, Jackson graduated from Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City and began touring. Jackson's father quit his job to become her full-time manager and he hired Bob Neal to book her engagements. Jackson's first concert dates included up-and-coming performer [[Elvis Presley]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=85-86}} Together, the pair worked multiple shows alongside several other country performers in the United States that year. Jackson's father chaperoned her during the shows and drove her from one date to the next.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=89-91}}{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=86}} Presley encouraged her to perform [[rock and roll]] music. He played her several [[R&B music|R&B]] records and informed her of rock's growing popularity.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Jackson also joined the cast of the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in 1955.<ref name="CMT Bio">{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Country Legends We Love: Wanda Jackson |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=July 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713035305/http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===1956–1960: Rock and roll years===
[[File:I Gotta Know - Half As Good A Girl - Billboard ad 1956.jpg|thumb|130px|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, July 21, 1956]] 
In 1956, Decca Records released Jackson from her contract. With Hank Thompson's help,{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=18}} she secured a new contract with Capitol Records the same year.<ref name="allmusic"/> At her first Capitol recording session, Jackson cut two country songs and one rock and roll selection. One song, "[[I Gotta Know (Wanda Jackson song)|I Gotta Know]]", incorporated elements of both country and rock. According to Jackson, the song's mixture of rock allowed her to get acquainted with the genre.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=119}} Released as a single in 1956, "I Gotta Know" became Jackson's second commercially successful release, peaking at number 15 on the ''Billboard'' country and western sides chart.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard"/> Jackson continued recording rock and roll music under her Capitol contract and was given full permission to do so by producer Ken Nelson. Jackson also composed several of her Capitol recordings, including "Baby Loves Him", "Cool Love" and "Mean Mean Man".{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=123-27}} She continued recording country music as well, often putting each style on either side of a single release.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}}

Writers and critics have remarked positively about Jackson's recordings from the 1950s and noted their take on women's sexuality. Mary A. Bufwack and [[Robert K. Oermann]] described songs like "Baby Loves Him" as "rockabilly classics". In addition, they commented that Jackson's rock records were "sexually aggressive" and demonstrated "almost frightening savagery".{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Bruce Eder added that Jackson's material was at times "astonishingly raucous and even raunchy".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Queen of Rockabilly'': Wanda Jackson: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714034504/https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, Kurt Wolff found that Jackson's rock material was also mixed with traditional country elements, which added to her musical individuality: "Jackson mixed straight country material and hot-to-the-core rockabilly numbers almost right from the beginning...Songs like 'Fujiyama Mama' and 'Mean Mean Man' were hard and fast, giving her plenty of reason to shimmy around in her glamorous fringe dresses".{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=275}}

In 1957, Jackson began working under a new booking agent, who arranged several tours in 1957 and 1958. Fellow performers included [[Johnny Cash]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Carl Perkins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=131-132}} With her new management, Jackson was making more money, sometimes as much as $500 per gig.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=116}} Meanwhile, her follow-up singles proved unsuccessful in the United States. According to Jackson, Capitol was unsure how to market her. "Capitol was still trying to figure out what to do with me, but they maintained faith that I could have strong potential in the teen market," she recalled in 2017.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=127}} To promote her material, the label chose to release Jackson's [[Wanda Jackson (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1958. The record mixed both rock and country selections.<ref name="debut album">{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=Williams |title=''Wanda Jackson'': Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wanda-jackson-mw0000661809 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=May 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501033617/https://www.allmusic.com/album/wanda-jackson-mw0000661809 |url-status=live }}</ref> Included were her covers of the rock songs "[[Money Honey (Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters song)|Money Honey]]" and "[[Long Tall Sally]]".

Also in 1958, Jackson saw success overseas with the rock and roll single, "[[Fujiyama Mama]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> Ken Nelson was reluctant to release the song, with its references to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=128-129}} Yet, the disc found commercial appeal with Japanese fans, reaching number one on the nation's music chart.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fox |first1=Courtney |title=The 15 Best Wanda Jackson Songs |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/wanda-jackson-songs/ |website=Wide Open Country |date=March 9, 2021 |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714030958/https://www.wideopencountry.com/wanda-jackson-songs/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The song's success led Jackson to a Japanese tour in 1959. She played venues in major cities including [[Tokyo]] and [[Okinawa (city)|Okinawa]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=145-149}} Upon her return to America, Jackson played in [[Las Vegas]] with Bob Wills and did additional concerts with her newly formed touring band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=154}} At different points, the band lineup included [[Roy Clark]] and black pianist [[Al Downing (musician)|Big Al Downing]].{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} She recalled touring alongside Downing, who was sometimes denied entrance into venues because of his race. In response, Jackson would refuse to work a show unless Downing performed with her. "Look, he's part of our band. If he's not welcome, then none of us are," she once told a club owner.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=154-156}}

In 1960, Jackson's album cover of "[[Let's Have a Party]]" was discovered by an Iowa [[disc jockey]], which led to an increased interest in it by radio listeners.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Upon the encouragement of Capitol Records, "Let's Have a Party" was issued as a single the same year.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=159-160}} By July 1960, the single had reached number 37 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|pop music chart]], becoming her first American rock and roll hit.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Let's Have a Party" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/wanda-jackson/chart-history/hsi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032346/https://www.billboard.com/music/wanda-jackson/chart-history/HSI/song/576287 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} It also found commercial success in Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name="Australian Songs">{{cite book|title=Australian Charts Book 1970—1992|first=David|last=Kent|isbn=978-0-646-11917-5|year=1993|publisher=Australian Chart Book Pty Ltd, Turramurra, N.S.W.}}</ref><ref name="UK Singles">{{cite web|title=Wanda Jackson — Peak chart positions|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wanda%20jackson/|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|access-date=29 November 2013|archive-date=July 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710021244/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wanda%20jackson/|url-status=live}}</ref> The success of "Let's Have a Party" led to Jackson to rename her band "The Party Timers"<ref name="allmusic"/> and prompted her label to release the compilation, ''[[Rockin' with Wanda]]'' (1960).

Her third studio album for Capitol, as noted, came along in early 1961, titled ''[[There's a Party Goin' On (Wanda Jackson album)|There's a Party Goin' On]]'', which included more rock and roll material.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=163}} Richie Unterberger of AllMusic described the LP as a "pretty solid and energetic set" despite not having "most of Wanda's best rockabilly sides".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Unterberger |first1=Richie |title=''There's a Party Goin' On'': Wanda Jackson: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/theres-a-party-goin-on-mw0000853846 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032346/https://www.allmusic.com/album/theres-a-party-goin-on-mw0000853846 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1961–1971: New languages and return to country music===
In the early 1960s, old school rock and roll musicians lost favor as the "Big Beat" of the [[British Invasion]] grew in popularity.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=262}} Feeling pressure from Capitol, Ken Nelson met with Jackson to discuss which genre she should fit.

After Jackson spent time touring with Elvis Presley, the pair's relationship became romantic in 1955.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Sullivan |first1=James |title=Wanda Jackson Remembers Elvis |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=December 9, 2005 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/wanda-jackson-remembers-elvis-96708/ |access-date=12 September 2021 |archive-date=September 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210913000346/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/wanda-jackson-remembers-elvis-96708/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He asked her to make the relationship official by giving Jackson a small diamond ring that she wore on a necklace.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=103}} In her autobiography, she explained that Presley "won my heart as I was just beginning to understand what it really meant to embrace my femininity and express myself as a young woman."{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=85}} According to Jackson, the pair's relationship ended in 1956 once Presley began appearing in films and [[Colonel Tom Parker]] took control of his career.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=119-121}}

In her teen years, Jackson befriended aspiring country performer [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]]. The two often appeared on the ''Ozark Jubilee'' television show and socialized frequently. Norma Jean began dating local resident, Wendell Goodman, and Jackson sometimes joined them on dates.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=202-204}} In 1961, Norma Jean accepted an offer to become a cast member of ''[[The Porter Wagoner Show]]'' in Nashville and ended her relationship with Goodman. Jackson and Goodman started dating shortly after their breakup. In her 2017 book, she recalled that she fell in love with him prior to their dating: "When they [Norma Jean and Goodman] had first come into the house and I saw Wendell, that was it. It was love at first sight."{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=205-206}} The couple married in 1961.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Goodman had begun a career in computers with IBM, but left the position to become his wife's full-time business manager.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wanda Jackson & Pam Tillis: Rockin' the Country: Women at the Fore |journal=Elmore Magazine |date=May 1, 2007 |url=https://www.elmoremagazine.com/2007/05/influences/wanda-jackson-pam-tillis |access-date=30 August 2021 |archive-date=August 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830010205/https://www.elmoremagazine.com/2007/05/influences/wanda-jackson-pam-tillis |url-status=live }}</ref> He later oversaw and managed his wife's company named Wanda Jackson Enterprises. In 2017, Goodman died at the age of 81.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wendell Goodman, husband and manager of Oklahoma music legend Wanda Jackson, died Sunday |url=https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5550043/wendell-goodman-husband-and-manager-of-oklahoma-music-legend-wanda-jackson-died-sunday |access-date=30 August 2021 |work=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=May 22, 2017 |archive-date=August 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830010204/https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5550043/wendell-goodman-husband-and-manager-of-oklahoma-music-legend-wanda-jackson-died-sunday |url-status=live }}</ref>

The couple had two children together.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Their daughter, Gina, was born in 1962{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=218}} while their son, Greg, was born in 1964.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=220}} Because Jackson's husband traveled with her, their children were kept home and raised by nannies. Jackson's parents also kept the children on weekends. "I knew it wasn't a normal childhood for them, and I've always carried a little guilt about that," she recalled in 2017.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=220-222}}

===Personal challenges and spirituality===
{{quote box
| quote = "I had a lot to learn, but God was teaching me. We were surrounded by some of the greatest people who came alongside us and shepherded us as we grew in our faith. I felt like, at the age of thirty-three, I was just learning what it really meant to live life to the fullest. He saved our marriage, too, as Wendell and I came together in pursuit of spiritual morality. Our priorities were realigned and we were both filled with an indescribable sense of peace."

By 1971, Jackson had become increasingly unhappy in her professional and personal life. "I had everything that a person could need or want. But I still couldn't shake that dull but persistent sense of emptiness inside," she later explained.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=258}} She and her husband had also developed a problem with alcohol. Their problems with drinking led Goodman to become physically and verbally abusive with Jackson.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Upon returning from a show, Jackson recalled going to church with her family and having a life-altering experience. "After we got up off our knees, everything was different," she stated in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=262}} The couple found solace in Christianity and dedicated their personal lives to spirituality in 1971.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} They were later baptized, and the couple went on to state that faith saved their marriage.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=262}}

The couple's belief in their faith would lead them to working with [[Evangelism|Evangelist]]s in [[Dallas, Texas]] during the late 1970s. Her husband set up an office building in the city where that offered resources to various ministries in the local area.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=274-278}} As Jackson's rockabilly music revived in the 1980s, the couple decided to invest less professional time with Christianity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Country Legends We Love: Wanda Jackson |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=30 August 2021 |archive-date=July 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713035305/http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> "It was hard to feel right about singing in bars again, but God confirmed in my spirit, time and time again, that that's where He wanted me and that's where I could be most effective," she explained in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=283}}

===Health problems===
In the 2010s, Jackson developed [[pneumonia]] and was hospitalized for a week.<ref name="Rolling Stone 2019"/> A knee replacement became infected with [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and she fell several times in her Oklahoma house, damaging her shoulder.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=309}} In 2017, her internal bleeding was treated at a hospital in [[Tijuana, Mexico]] that focused on nutritional and medical therapy.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=311}} A 2018 stroke led her to retire.<ref name="Rolling Stone 2019"/> She said it would have impaired her more if her daughter had brought her to the hospital later. "I was so fortunate", she told ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2021.<ref name="The Independent"/>
