'''Blue Rodeo''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[country rock]] band formed in 1984 in [[Toronto]], Ontario. They have released 16 full-length studio albums, four live recordings, one greatest hits album, and two video/DVDs, along with multiple solo albums, side projects, and collaborations.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/discography/|title = Discography|work = Official Community of Blue Rodeo|access-date = November 20, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
[[High school]] friends Jim Cuddy and Greg Keelor began playing music professionally together after completing university. They put together several bands without commercial success in the late 1970s, releasing a single as Hi-Fi's in 1980.

Cuddy and Keelor moved to [[New York City]] in the early 1980s to further their music careers. There, they met keyboardist and fellow Canadian [[Bob Wiseman]], who, at that time, was working as a producer. Upon returning to [[Toronto]] in the summer of 1984, the trio decided to form a band. The name "Blue Rodeo" had already been chosen for the new group when they met former [[David Wilcox (Canadian musician)|David Wilcox]] drummer [[Cleave Anderson]] and asked him to join. Anderson, in turn, recommended his former bandmate in The Sharks, bassist Bazil Donovan, and the new band's lineup was essentially set.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bluerodeo.com/people/biography/JimCuddy.aspx| title=Jim Cuddy Biography| work=Official Community of Blue Rodeo| access-date=May 14, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092840/http://www.bluerodeo.com/people/biography/JimCuddy.aspx| archive-date=May 12, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> On February 7, 1985, Blue Rodeo played their first show together at [[The Rivoli]] in Toronto;<ref>Schneider, Jason [http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=139&csid2=9&fid1=42671 Timeline: Blue Rodeo: Better Off as We Are]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''[[Exclaim!]]'' December 2009.</ref> one week later, they performed at [[Handsome Ned]]'s "Honky Tonk Heart."<ref>"The birth of Blue Rodeo." ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 16, 2004.</ref>

The band quickly earned a following in Toronto and was subsequently signed to Canadian independent record label Risque Disque. They entered the studio in 1986 with [[Rush (band)|Rush]] producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]] and recorded several songs that would comprise Blue Rodeo's debut album, ''[[Outskirts (album)|Outskirts]]''. Released in March 1987, ''Outskirts'' met with moderate success in Canada until "[[Try (Blue Rodeo song)|Try]]" was released as a single in October of that year. The single was an immediate hit, going to number one on the ''RPM Country Tracks'' chart and number six on the ''RPM Top Singles'' chart, establishing Blue Rodeo as one of Canada's top new bands and carrying ''Outskirts'' to 4× Platinum status in sales. The music video for the single featured Keelor's then-girlfriend [[Michelle McAdorey]], who soon had success with her own band, [[Crash Vegas]].

In 1992, the band's song "After the Rain," written by Cuddy and Keelor, was the most-performed song in Canada.<ref name="Inc.1992">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title='Do it for you' does it at the SOCAN Awards|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|date=14 November 1992|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> By 1999 the band had sold more than two million albums in Canada.<ref name="Inc.1999">{{cite magazine|author=Bettsy Powell|title=There's no place like home|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58|date=January 16, 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=50 and 58|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

Cuddy, Keelor, Donovan, Boguski and Cripps have all released solo albums. Glenn Milchem performs his own solo music under the pseudonym "the swallows" and had co-founded, with his twin brother John, the rock duo [[Starvin Hungry]].

==Career==
===2004–2006: Career beginnings and debut===
[[File:brandi-carlile2.jpg|thumb|Carlile performing in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] in 2006]]

Carlile began her career performing in Seattle music clubs with twin brothers [[Phil and Tim Hanseroth]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Scanlon |first=Tom |title=Rising stars Jesse Sykes and Brandi Carlile thrill hometown |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News. |page=1 |date=April 1, 2007 }}</ref> In the beginning, [[Columbia Records]] signed Carlile in 2004 on the strength of songs she had been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Carlile showcased those early songs along with newly recorded tracks in the self-titled album ''[[Brandi Carlile (album)|Brandi Carlile]]''. The 2006 re-release by Columbia Records included re-recordings of "Throw It All Away" and "What Can I Say".{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

The album earned enthusiastic reviews; she was featured on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s "10 Artists to Watch in 2005" list, and other "artist to watch" lists by [[Interview (magazine)|''Interview'']] and [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']]. In his review of the album, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote, "The accolades, combined with cover artwork that captures her at her cutest – as if she were a cousin of [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] – might make some listeners suspicious of Carlile, since the cumulative effect makes her seem like a pretty, prepackaged creation." He further wrote, "her music is... rich, warm, and seductive, familiar in its form and sound, yet sounding fresh, even original, particularly in how her folky singer/songwriter foundation blends with her art-pop inclinations."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/brandi-carlile-mw0000190795 |title=Brandi Carlile – Brandi Carlile – Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards – AllMusic |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212082356/http://www.allmusic.com/album/brandi-carlile-mw0000190795 |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The album peaked at No. 80 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard charts|US Folk Albums]] chart.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Shortly after the release of the album, she left her home in [[Seattle]] and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, as she had worked with them on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album [[The Story (Brandi Carlile album)|''The Story'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile |title=Brandi Carlile |website=Last.fm |access-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120041833/http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile |archive-date=January 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists, including [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[the Fray]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Tori Amos]], and [[Shawn Colvin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile/+wiki |title=Brandi Carlile |website=Last.fm |access-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112134914/http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile/+wiki |archive-date=January 12, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2007–2009: Breakthrough with ''The Story''===

"It wasn't until 2007's ''The Story'' – her T-Bone Burnett-produced sophomore release – that we realized even half of what we'd been dealt.

Three songs from Carlile's previous album, "Tragedy", "What Can I Say", and "Throw It All Away", were featured in the TV drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.

In 2011, Carlile's album ''[[Live at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony]]'' reached number 14 on the [[Top Rock Albums]] chart. The live album finds Carlile performing a mix of original songs and cover material. Recorded during two sold-out shows in November 2010 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington, the album features [[Washington (state)|Washington]]-native Carlile and her long-time band (including brothers [[Phil and Tim Hanseroth]]) performing alongside the [[Seattle Symphony]]. Andrew Leahey from [[AllMusic]] called it Carlile's best and wrote, "'Live at Benaroya Hall' is more concerned with dressing up Carlile's music in elegant, orchestral clothing, and the results are pretty stunning, from the grandeur of 'The Story' – now featuring horns, woodwinds, and strings. This isn't Brandi Carlile's first concert album, but it's certainly the best."{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

"We didn't make any demos.

''[[KCMP|The Current]]'' reviewing the album wrote,
{{blockquote|I thought she leaned too adult-contemporary for my tastes. Boy, was I wrong! This might be her most rockin' album to date. The album starts like a house afire: Carlile totally nails the vocal on the gospel influenced "Wherever Is Your Heart", and this one makes you realize just how good she is. When she sings, you're a believer. She'll have you singing along on the infectious "The Thing I Regret". Maybe the biggest surprise on the album is "Mainstream Kid", which shows some grit! It's as badass as Carlile has ever sounded. If you had Brandi Carlile pegged as an adult-contemporary softie, you might try again. Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins show that they aren't afraid to rock out.

The foundation has awarded grants to multiple organizations including [[ReverbNation|Reverb]], [[Honor the Earth]], the [[Bridge School Benefit|Bridge School]], Children in Conflict, [[Black Visions Collective]], [[Campaign Zero]], the Women's Funding Alliance, [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]], and the [[Human Rights Campaign]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lookingoutfoundation.org/about|title=Our Mission|website=Looking Out Foundation|access-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321222459/https://www.lookingoutfoundation.org/about|archive-date=March 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Looking Out Foundation has launched numerous grassroots campaigns including Looking Out for the Hungry, Fund Racial Justice, COVID-19 Relief Fund, the IF Project, Fight the Fear, and the Story Campaign.

'''Buffalo Springfield''' was a rock band formed in [[Los Angeles]] by Canadian musicians [[Neil Young]], [[Bruce Palmer]] and [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]] and American musicians [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Richie Furay]]. The group, widely known for the song "[[For What It's Worth]]",<ref name="AM" /> released three albums and several singles from 1966 to 1968. Their music combined elements of [[folk music]] and [[country music]] with influences from the [[British Invasion]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. Like contemporary band [[the Byrds]], they were key to the early development of [[folk rock]]. The band took their name from a [[steamroller]] parked outside their house.

Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Martin (drums, vocals), Palmer (bass guitar), Furay (guitar, vocals) and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals).<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Russell|title=Encyclopedia of Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZjoO9_YhfwC|year=1983|publisher=Crescent Books|isbn=978-0-517-40865-0|page=161}}</ref> The band signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1966 and released their debut single "[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]", which became a hit in Los Angeles.<ref name="RRHF">{{cite web|title=Buffalo Springfield|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio/|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=February 18, 2016|archive-date=August 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829121654/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio|url-status=live}}</ref> The following January, they released the [[protest song]] "For What It's Worth", which became their only US top 10 hit and a [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] anthem.<ref name="AM" /> Their second album, ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]'', marked their progression to psychedelia and [[hard rock]]<ref name="AM">{{AllMusic | class=artist|id=mn0000939567| tab=biography| label=Artist Biography| first=Richie| last=Unterberger| access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> and featured songs such as "[[Bluebird (Buffalo Springfield song)|Bluebird]]" and "[[Mr. Soul]]".

After several drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1968. Their third and final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', was compiled and released shortly after their dissolution. Stephen Stills went on to form the supergroup [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] with [[David Crosby]] of the Byrds and [[Graham Nash]] of [[the Hollies]]. Neil Young launched his solo career and later joined Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1969. Furay, along with [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], went on to form the country-rock band [[Poco (band)|Poco]].<ref name="Eder">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poco-mn0000297894/biography | website=[[AllMusic]] | title=Poco | author=Bruce Eder | access-date=2017-06-03 | archive-date=2017-04-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426064247/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poco-mn0000297894/biography | url-status=live}}</ref> Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997,<ref name="RRHF" /> and briefly reunited for a comeback tour in 2011.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[Neil Young]] and [[Stephen Stills]] met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario. Young was there with [[the Squires]], a [[Winnipeg]] group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with [[The Company (folk-rock band)|the Company]], a spin-off from the [[Cafe Au Go Go|Au Go Go Singers]]. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where he worked as a [[session musician]] and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, [[the Monkees]].<ref name="Prown Newquist 1997">{{cite book|author= Pete Prown, HP Newquist|date= 1997|title= Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|page= 45|publisher= Hal Leonard| isbn= 978-0-7935-4042-6}}</ref> Told by record producer [[Barry Friedman]] there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former [[The Squires|Squires]] bass player [[Ken Koblun]] to come join him in [[California]]. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group [[3's a Crowd (band)|3's a Crowd]].

While in Toronto in early 1966, Young met [[Bruce Palmer]], a Canadian who was playing bass for [[the Mynah Birds]]. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for [[Motown Records]] when their singer Ricky James Matthews—James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as [[Rick James]]—was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being [[Desertion|AWOL]].

With their record deal cancelled, Young and Palmer pawned the Mynah Birds' musical equipment and bought a 1953 [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] [[hearse]], which they drove to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="WFP">{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|title=One moment that made music history|author=John Einarson|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=April 16, 2017|access-date=November 26, 2018|archive-date=November 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127110629/https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Young and Palmer arrived in L.A. hoping to meet [[Stephen Stills]], who, as Young had learned, was living in the city. However, after almost a week of searching clubs and coffeehouses, the pair had been unable to find Stills. Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. While the two were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]], they were spotted by Stills and [[Richie Furay]], who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.<ref name="WFP" />

Drummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group [[the Standells]] and with [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[the Dillards]], joined at the suggestion of [[the Byrds]]' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of [[steamroller]] made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on 11 April 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood]], five days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for [[the Dillards]] and [[the Byrds]].

=== Management and first recordings ===
[[Chris Hillman]] of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.

The first Buffalo Springfield single, "[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[Monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's [[Buffalo Springfield (album)|eponymous album]] was released by Atlantic subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in October 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6igEAAAAMBAJ&q=buffalo+springfield&pg=PP1|title=Billboard|date=October 22, 1966}}</ref> A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.

[[File:Buffalo Springfield Promotional Photo.png|thumb|The band in late 1966]]

In November 1966, Stills composed "[[For What It's Worth]]", responding to a protest that had turned violent following the closing of the [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]] nightclub on [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-aug-05-me-then5-story.html|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=August 5, 2007|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=January 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130193147/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|url-status=live}}</ref> The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a top ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song "Baby Don't Scold Me" with "For What It's Worth" and re-releasing the album. "For What It's Worth" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="Murrells 1978">{{cite book| author = Joseph Murrells| year = 1978| title = The Book of Golden Discs| publisher = Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217 217]| isbn = 978-0-214-20512-5| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217}}</ref>

=== Lineup changes, arrest, and breakup ===
In January 1967, Palmer was deported for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/16/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Bruce Palmer|author=Adam Sweeting|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 16, 2004|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=July 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720123624/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/16/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|url-status=live}}</ref> but returned to the group at the beginning of June, while Young was temporarily absent (guitarist Doug Hastings filled in for Young during this period). The band, with [[David Crosby]] sitting in, played the [[Monterey Pop Festival]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA160|page=160|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|author=Peter Lavezzoli|publisher=A&C Black|date=April 24, 2006|isbn=9780826418159|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-date=July 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727140137/https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA160|url-status=live}}</ref> Young returned in August and the band severed ties with Greene and Stone, then divided its time between playing gigs and finalising the second album, ultimately titled ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]''. Produced by Ertegun, ''Buffalo Springfield Again'' was released in November 1967. It includes "[[Mr. Soul]]", "Rock & Roll Woman", "Bluebird", "Sad Memory", and "Broken Arrow". The band toured as support for [[the Beach Boys]] during early 1968.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCL_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|page=34|title=Neil Young: Heart of Gold|author=Harvey Kubernik|publisher=Omnibus Press|date=November 9, 2015|isbn=9781783235797|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-date=July 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727142834/https://books.google.com/books?id=OCL_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|url-status=live}}</ref> In January of that year, after Palmer was again deported for drug possession, [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], who had worked as engineer on the band's second album, was hired as a permanent replacement on [[electric bass|bass]].<ref name="break">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XG9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA125|page=125|title=The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World|author=David V.

Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing.

In the [[Netflix]] documentary ''Echo in the Canyon'', Stills related an incident that illustrated the band's problems with law enforcement. The band were hosting a small rehearsal party, attended by [[Eric Clapton]] among others, in April 1968.<ref name="break" /> Despite reportedly playing at a comfortable sound level, a police officer arrived after a disturbing the peace complaint. During the encounter, the officer smelled marijuana and Stills ran next door to "call lawyers," but in actuality went next door and escaped out the bathroom window. According to Stills, Young was going to chase the police down the street, to which Stills said "cause he's Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that". Ultimately, Young, Furay and Messina were arrested and sent to the [[LA County Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]].

Following a gig at the Long Beach Auditorium on 5 May 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup. Stills and Furay stayed with Atlantic, while Young moved to Warner Brothers.<ref name="break" /> Later, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'' (1968).

== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts ==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}

Martin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]'s stand-in with [[the Monkees]]), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]) who later joined Arthur Lee's [[Love (band)|Love]], bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]] and others.

The new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized Holiday Rock Festival in San Francisco on 25–26 December 1968, but soon ran afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to give up future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to use the name ''New Buffalo''. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|title=Dewey Martin: Drummer with Buffalo Springfield|date=February 7, 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233308/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 1969, Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob "BJ" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and the Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called Medicine Ball, which released a lone album in 1970 for [[Uni Records]]. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which did not appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.

In 1984, Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), [[Stan Endersby]] (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form the Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to [[Toronto]] to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin dropped out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave Buffalo Springfield Revisited permission to tour with that name.

In July 1986, Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills gathered at Stills' house, with Buffalo Springfield Revisited keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the 1986 rehearsals was video recorded. It was the last time all five original members performed together. Plans for a subsequent reunion tour were abandoned.

By 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to [[Topanga, California]], where Dennis Knicely joined to perform percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and [[Michael Curtis (musician)|Michael Curtis]] (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a [[cease and desist]] order on Martin in 1992, and Martin retired from music again the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|title=Buffalo Springfield Rides Again, Along With Others|date=September 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233311/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

== 2010–11 reunion ==
On his album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000), Young sang of his desire to re-form the group and to "see those guys again and give it a shot" in "Buffalo Springfield Again". Palmer (2004) and Martin (2009) later died, preventing a reunion of the original lineup.

'''Carbon Leaf''' is a [[quintet]] from [[Richmond, Virginia]], known for their [[alt-country]], [[Celtic rock|Celtic]], and [[folk rock|folk]]-infused [[indie rock]]. Though some of the band members have changed through the years, Carbon Leaf has been consistently creating and performing music since the early 1990s. The band currently consists of founding members Barry Privett, Carter Gravatt, and Terry Clark, as well as Jon Markel and Jesse Humphrey. Carbon Leaf is best known for the song "Life Less Ordinary", which debuted in 2004 and reached #5 on Billboard's [[Adult Alternative Songs|Adult Alternative]] charts.

==History==
===1992–2004: The Constant Ivy Music years===
[[Image:Carbon Leaf (Barry Privett) in Cleveland, OH Grog Shop.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Barry Privett]]
Carbon Leaf got their start at [[Randolph-Macon College]] in [[Virginia]] in 1992, practicing in an auditorium on campus. Their next step was playing backyard parties, mixers, fraternity, and sorority parties. Shortly after everyone graduated, they moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. From Richmond, they played the college circuit in Virginia and up the East Coast before moving on to clubs. Their style is not "Brazilian Polka Metal", despite the joking claims of guitarist Carter Gravatt (B., David. 2002).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814181900/http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm |title=Carbon Leaf Interview -Chicago, 2002 |work=Blue Tint Magazine |archive-date=August 14, 2004}}</ref>

''[[Meander (album)|Meander]]'', their first album, was released in 1995. The first songs Carbon Leaf wrote, including "One Day" and "Country Monkee", are on the album.

''[[Shadows in the Banquet Hall]]'', released in 1997, includes "Flood", "Wolftrap and Fireflies", and "Attica's Flower Box Window". An award-winning video was made for "Flood".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

''[[Ether~Electrified Porch Music]]'' (1999) is the first album with Jordan Medas as the [[bassist]] and contains "Home", "American Tale", and "Blue Ridge Laughing". The band had sold over 10,000 copies of their first three independent CDs by late 1999, released on their own label, Constant Ivy Music.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carbonleaf.com/biosphere.html#1999 |title=Carbon Leaf – The Bio-Shere |author=Carbon Leaf |access-date=November 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724165003/http://www.carbonleaf.com/biosphere.html#1999#1999 |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In Spring 2004, Carbon Leaf signed with [[Vanguard Records]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carbonleaf.com/pr/02.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027060927/http://www.carbonleaf.com/pr/02.htm |title=Richmond, VA-Based Carbon Leaf Signs with Vanguard Records |author=Vanguard Records |archive-date=October 27, 2006 |access-date=November 17, 2009}}</ref> part of the [[Welk Music Group]] and in July of that year released their album, ''[[Indian Summer (Carbon Leaf album)|Indian Summer]]''.

The album was produced by John Morand and [[David Lowery (musician)|David Lowery]]. The video for "Life Less Ordinary" debuted on January 5, 2005.

In June 2006, an interview with Carbon Leaf guitarist Terry Clark was chosen as the cover feature for the inaugural issue of ''The Green Room'' magazine. On September 12, 2006, the band released ''[[Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat]]''. According to their blog, it was recorded in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and mixed in collaboration with producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]] and [[Trina Shoemaker]].<ref>2006.

Carbon Leaf played at [[Top of the Stairs#Sudflood|Sudflood]] 2007, and dedicated their performance to the memory of the lives lost in the [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech shootings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carbonleaf.com/downloads/video/mp4_waemmvt.html|title=SudFlood – Virginia Tech April 28, 2007|access-date=November 17, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517095447/http://www.carbonleaf.com/downloads/video/mp4_waemmvt.html|archive-date=May 17, 2008}}</ref>  All proceeds went towards the memorial fund for the victims and their families.

In August 2007, Scott Milstead was replaced by Jason Neal on drums. In August 2008, Jordan Medas left the band to pursue a teaching career. He was replaced in October 2008 by Jon Markel.<ref>[http://www.carbonleaf.com News – Official Carbon Leaf Website] – Retrieved January 16, 2009</ref>

The producers of ''[[Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!]]'' were using an acoustic version of "Life Less Ordinary" as a placeholder in the film. The request to license it snowballed into wanting to license additional songs and ultimately a request that Carbon Leaf do the majority of the soundtrack.<ref name="WCNR interview">{{cite AV media |date=March 20, 2010 |title=Corner Lounge: Carbon Leaf 3-20-10 |url=http://67.72.16.166/wcnr/2281464.mp3 |format=mp3 |medium=radio |publisher=[[WCNR]] |location=Keswick, Virginia |access-date=March 23, 2010 |time=19:24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705234754/http://67.72.16.166/wcnr/2281464.mp3 |archive-date=July 5, 2011 }}</ref> Carbon Leaf contributed six songs to the soundtrack for the animated film, including  versions of "Life Less Ordinary" and "Let Your Troubles Roll By" with new alternate lyrics (in the second verse) and "The Friendship Song".<ref name="Richmond, VA subreddit - We are Carbon Leaf, ask us anything!">{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/2o5zlu/comment/cmkk7q6/ |title=We are Carbon Leaf, ask us anything! |website=reddit.com |access-date=June 25, 2024}}</ref> The soundtrack and the direct-to-DVD movie were released on March 2, 2010.<ref name="CG2 OST">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033G9NUQ/ |title=Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey (Soundtrack) |website=Amazon |access-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref>

===2010–present: Return to indie status===
In March 2010, the band announced that they were amicably parting ways with their label, Vanguard Records, intending to record and release music on their own schedule and distribute it over the internet.<ref name="WCNR interview"/> Their plan was to market their music by giving it away at shows, a strategy not compatible with Vanguard's focus on CD sales.<ref name="WCNR interview"/> 

On July 6, 2010, they released ''[[How the West was One (Carbon Leaf album)|How the West was One]]'', inspired by and written during their tour of the [[Western United States|American West]], initially on their website and subsequently on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com]]. Their ninth studio album and third of 2010, a collection of original Christmas- and winter-themed songs titled ''[[Christmas Child (Carbon Leaf album)|Christmas Child]]'', was released on November 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BRW1ZA/ |title=Christmas Child |website=Amazon |access-date=December 20, 2010}}</ref> Barry Privett described the songs as "encompassing
both the joy and melancholy of the season."<ref name="CC press release"/>

Carbon Leaf launched a [[crowdfunding]] effort on in June 2013 to support their next studio album.

'''Christopher Hillman''' (born December 4, 1944)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=190}}</ref> is an American musician. He was the original bassist of [[the Byrds]]. With frequent collaborator [[Gram Parsons]], Hillman was a key figure in the development of [[country rock]], defining the genre through his work with the Byrds, [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]] and the country-rock group [[the Desert Rose Band]]. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Byrds.

==Early life==
Hillman was born in Los Angeles, California, the third of four children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guitarist Chris Hillman|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=4766|access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref> He spent his early years at his family's ranch home in rural northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], approximately {{convert|110|mi}} from Los Angeles. He has credited his older sister with exciting his interest in [[Country music|country]] and [[folk music]], when she returned from college during the late 1950s with folk music records by [[The New Lost City Ramblers]] and others. Hillman soon began watching many of the country-music shows on local television in southern California at the time such as ''Town Hall Party'', ''The [[Spade Cooley]] Show'' and ''Cal's Corral''. Hillman's mother encouraged his musical interests and bought him his first guitar; shortly thereafter he developed an interest in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], particularly the [[mandolin]]. At the age of 15, Hillman went to Los Angeles to see the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]] bluegrass band at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]], and later convinced his family to allow him to travel by train to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] for lessons from mandolinist Scott Hambly. When Chris was 16, his father committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/interviews/CW98_chris_hillman.aspx |title=Chris Hillman: 'Turn, Turn, Turn' |website=Cbn.com |access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref>

Hillman became known in San Diego's folk music community as a solid player; this won him an invitation to join his first band, the [[Scottsville Squirrel Barkers]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The band lasted barely two years, recording only one album (''Blue Grass Favorites'', which was distributed in supermarkets); however, it has a posthumous reputation as the spawning ground for a number of musicians who went on to play in [[the Eagles]], the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, [[Hearts & Flowers]], and the [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]]. When the band broke up in late 1963 Hillman received an invitation to join the Golden State Boys, regarded as the top bluegrass band in [[southern California]] and featuring future country star [[Vern Gosdin]], his brother Rex and banjoist [[Don Parmley]] (later of the [[Bluegrass Cardinals]]). Shortly thereafter the band changed its name to [[The Hillmen]];<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> soon Hillman was appearing regularly on television and using a fictitious ID, "Chris Hardin", to allow the underage musician into the country bars where many of his gigs were played. When the Hillmen folded, he briefly joined a spinoff of Randy Sparks' [[The New Christy Minstrels|New Christy Minstrels]] known as the Green Grass Revival.

== Career ==

=== The Byrds (1964–1968) ===
{{main|The Byrds}}
[[File:The Byrds 1965.png|thumb|Hillman (far left) as a member of the Byrds in 1965]]
At this point a frustrated Hillman considered quitting music and enrolling at [[UCLA]] when he received an offer from The Hillmen's former manager and producer, Jim Dickson, to join Jim (later Roger) McGuinn, David Crosby, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke in a new band, The Byrds.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Hillman was recruited to play bass guitar, although he had never picked up the instrument. Thanks to his bluegrass background, he quickly developed his own melodic style on the instrument. The Byrds' first single, a jangly cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", was an international hit and marked the birth of [[folk rock]]. During the mid-1960s the Byrds ranked as one of the most successful and influential American pop groups; they recorded a string of hits, including "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", "[[Eight Miles High]]" and "[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]".

Hillman kept a low profile on the band's first two albums, on which McGuinn and Clark shared lead vocals with Crosby adding high harmony and singing the bridge on "[[All I Really Want to Do]]". However, Clark's departure in 1966 and Crosby's growing restlessness allowed Hillman the opportunity to develop as a singer and songwriter in the group. He came into his own on the Byrds' 1967 album ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', co-writing and sharing lead vocals with McGuinn on the hit "[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Hillman also wrote (and sang) the minor hit "[[Have You Seen Her Face]]", "Thoughts and Words", "Time Between" and "The Girl with No Name", the latter two demonstrating his bluegrass and country roots. Hillman's prominence continued with the Byrds' next album, ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'', on which he shared songwriting credit on seven of the album's eleven songs.

=== Pioneering country rock ===
Internal strife dogged the Byrds, and by the beginning of 1968 the band was down to two original members (Hillman and McGuinn), with Hillman's cousin [[Kevin Kelley (musician)|Kevin Kelley]] on drums. They then hired [[Gram Parsons]] to replace Crosby. Hillman, who had brought country music into the Byrds' earliest recording of "Satisfied Mind", found another lover of country music in Parsons.  ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' was recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and continues to inspire musicians in the Americana format.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Parsons left the band shortly thereafter; Hillman brought in former Kentucky Colonels guitarist [[Clarence White]] as a replacement and White suggested that the group replace Kelley with [[Gene Parsons]] (no relation to Gram) on drums, but this line-up was short-lived and Hillman himself left the Byrds due to financial misappropriation by their management.

=== The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969–1972) ===
{{Main article|The Flying Burrito Brothers}}
[[File:FlyingBurritos1970.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: [[Pete Kleinow|'Sneaky' Pete Kleinow]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], Chris Hillman, [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] & [[Bernie Leadon]] ]]

Hillman teamed with Gram Parsons again (this time as vocalist, guitarist and songwriter) to form the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Further honing their pioneering country-rock hybrid sound by combining the energy, instrumentation and attitude of [[rock and roll]] with the issues and themes of [[country music]], the Burritos recorded the landmark ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'' (1969) followed by 1970's ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]''. Parsons was fired from the line-up by June 1970 (replaced by guitarist [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]]) when the band toured Canada as part of the [[Festival Express]] tour, with Hillman reverting to bass guitar. Hillman stayed with the band for two more records, ''[[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|The Flying Burrito Brothers]]'' and ''[[Last of the Red Hot Burritos]]''.

=== Various bands and solo career (1970s) ===
{{Main article|Manassas (band)|Souther-Hillman-Furay Band|McGuinn, Clark & Hillman}}
Before the Flying Burrito Brothers disbanded, Hillman joined [[Stephen Stills]]' band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]].<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> They released two albums, a 1972 [[Manassas (album)|self-titled double album]], and a 1973 album ''[[Down the Road (Manassas album)|Down the Road]]''. Led by Stills, Manassas was an exploration into a mixture of rock, country, blues, bluegrass and Latin music. In 1972, Stills gave Hillman a 1924 [[Lloyd Loar]] [[Gibson F-5]] mandolin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lewis |first=Randy |date=2017-09-18 |title=Byrds co-founder Chris Hillman taps David Crosby, Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty for new solo album |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-chris-hillman-bidin-my-time-tom-petty-20170810-story.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-09-18 |title=Chris Hillman |url=https://www.latimes.com/94338813-132.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> Hillman remained with Manassas until 1973, when he briefly re-joined the original line-up of the Byrds for a reunion album on [[Asylum Records]].

In 1974, Hillman teamed with singer-songwriter [[Richie Furay]] (who co-founded [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Poco (band)|Poco]]) and songwriter [[JD Souther]] (who co-wrote much of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' early repertoire) in the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]].<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> The trio never quite gelled, and broke up in 1975 after two albums and internal squabbles.

Hillman released two solo albums, ''Slippin' Away'' and ''Clear Sailin''',<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> which included several songs co-written with ''[[Crawdaddy!|Crawdaddy]]'' magazine editor [[Peter Knobler]]. One of their songs, "Step on Out," was recorded by [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] on their 1985 album and became the title cut. He was also an in-demand studio musician, playing and singing on sessions for [[Gene Clark]], [[Dillard & Clark]], [[Poco (band)|Poco]], [[Dan Fogelberg]] and others. After an early 1977 UK tour reunited him with [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Gene Clark]], the trio stayed together as [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]] for two albums<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> (on which Hillman continued his songwriting collaboration with Knobler) and one under the McGuinn-Hillman name, with a hit single in 1979's "Don't You Write Her Off".

=== The Desert Rose Band (1985–1994, 2008) ===
{{Main article|The Desert Rose Band}}
By the early 1980s Hillman had returned to his bluegrass and country roots, recording two acclaimed (mainly acoustic) albums for [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] with singer/guitarist/banjo player [[Herb Pedersen]] (a former member of [[The Dillards]]). Soon after, Hillman and Pedersen formed the [[Desert Rose Band]];<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> this proved to be Hillman's most commercially successful post-Byrds project. Their self-titled debut album in 1987 generated two [[Record chart|Top Ten]] country hits in "Love Reunited" (written with Steve Hill), "One Step Forward" and the number-one single "He's Back and I'm Blue." From 1987 until late 1993 the band recorded five albums and one Greatest Hits package and had a string of 16 country-music [[Billboard magazine|hits]] (the majority of which were in the country Top Ten) and a number of [[Academy of Country Music]] awards before disbanding in 1994. As Hillman said, "We definitely quit while we were ahead."

Chris Hillman, Herb Pedersen, JayDee Maness, John Jorgenson, Bill Bryson, and Steve Duncan performed their first reunion concert on August 27, 2008  in Solana Beach, CA. Before this date Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen were as a duo joined by John Jorgenson on May 2, 2008 for a small DRB set at the [[Station Inn]] in Nashville. This six-man lineup is the best known, and includes all of the original members present on the hit albums from the 1980s. At this show, Hillman said it was the first time they had played together in 19 years. They went through a string of DRB hits but were unable to play "He's Back and I'm Blue" because Hillman said he had forgotten the words. This sold-out show prompted Hillman and the band to play a handful of other reunion shows at  music festivals throughout the U.S. Several of these were recorded for inclusion on a live album, which Hillman hopes to release in the U.S. and Europe. If released, this will be the Desert Rose Band's only live album.

=== 1990s and beyond ===
[[File:ChrisHillman.jpg|thumb|Hillman in 2004]]
At the peak of the Desert Rose Band's success, Hillman began appearing infrequently with McGuinn. A duet recorded by the pair for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]'s ''[[Will The Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II]]'' album, "You Ain't Going Nowhere", reached the Country Top 10 in 1989. Soon the pair joined Crosby in a reformed Byrds, playing a handful of club dates. In 1990 they appeared at a tribute to [[Roy Orbison]], performing "Mr. Tambourine Man" with the song's composer [[Bob Dylan]]. That same year the Byrds cut four new songs for inclusion in a career-spanning box set, and in 1991 they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 1996 Hillman reunited with Desert Rose Band alumnus Herb Pederson for the CD ''Bakersfield Bound''. ''Like a Hurricane'' (1998) and three bluegrass-flavored releases on [[Rounder Records]] with Pedersen, [[Larry Rice (musician)|Larry Rice]], and [[Tony Rice]] followed. He appeared on the 1999 album ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'' in a duet with [[Steve Earle]] on "High Fashion Queen" (which Hillman wrote with Parsons).

After a brief hiatus Hillman and Pedersen returned with ''Way Out West'' (2002), a 17-track collection of country, [[roots rock]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]]; this was followed by ''The Other Side'' (2005). In 2010 he recorded "Live at Edwards Barn" with Herb Pedersen for Rounder Records.

Hillman has continued to write, perform and tour, with dates in 2017 with Herb Pedersen and John Jorgenson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrishillman.com/calendar.html |title=Tour Dates |publisher=Chris Hillman |access-date=2017-10-07}}</ref>  He released his latest album, ''Bidin' My Time'' (2017), co-produced with [[Tom Petty]], featuring guests including Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and members of The Heartbreakers. This has been described as "a kind of summing up of Hillman's long and varied career, incorporating the folk, bluegrass, country and rock styles he's touched on over the years."<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|title=Byrds Legend Chris Hillman Premieres Tom Petty-Produced 'Bidin' My Time' Album: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7968856/chris-hillman-bidin-my-time-album|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 7, 2017|date=September 19, 2017}}</ref>

Along with Roger McGuinn, Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives, Hillman toured in the U.S. with the 50th Anniversary of the Sweetheart of the Rodeo, to sold out venues and outstanding reviews.

His memoir, ''Time Between: My Life as a Byrd, Burrito Brother and Beyond,''  was published by BMG Books in November 2020, with positive reviews in Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, and now in the second printing.

==Personal life==
Chris Hillman identifies as a Christian although his father was Jewish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/counsel-of-elders-chris-hillman-on-looking-across-time/|title=Counsel of Elders: Chris Hillman on Looking Across Time|date=2017-11-10|website=The Bluegrass Situation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> He married  former record executive Connie Pappas in 1979, who influenced him to affiliate with the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|Greek Orthodox Church]]. He later stated, "I’m still learning. You know what I do on Sundays? I sing in a choir.

'''Cowboy Junkies''' are an [[alternative country]] and [[folk rock]] band formed in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada in 1985 by Alan Anton (bassist), Michael Timmins (songwriter, guitarist), Peter Timmins (drummer) and [[Margo Timmins]] (vocalist).<ref name=EMC>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/cowboy-junkies|title=Cowboy Junkies|website=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102001215/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/cowboy-junkies|archive-date=January 2, 2013|access-date=April 19, 2012}}</ref> The three Timminses are siblings, and Anton worked with Michael Timmins during their first couple of bands. John Timmins was a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their debut studio album.<ref name="86 Promo sheet"/> The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their studio albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.

Cowboy Junkies' 1986 debut studio album, produced by Canadian producer [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], was the [[blues]]-inspired ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'', recorded in the family garage using a single [[Ambisonics|ambisonic]] microphone.<ref name=EMC/>

The band gained wide recognition with their second studio album, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), recorded in 1987 at Toronto's [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. Their sound, again with [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988.<ref name=EMC/> 

Cowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, with tour dates booked into 2024.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tour |url=https://cowboyjunkies.com/tour/ |website=Cowboy Junkies |access-date=24 November 2023}}</ref>

==History==
=== Early history===
Alan Anton and Michael Timmins, lifelong friends who met in kindergarten, formed their first band in high school. In 1979, influenced by [[post-punk]] bands such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], they recruited drummer Geoff Railton and vocalist Liza Dawson-Whisker, and formed Hunger Project in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |title=Whites Off Earth Now {{!}} Backstory |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=January 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117122349/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017152650/https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |title=An interview with Michael Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies |work=Little Village |date=October 23, 2013 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=McLeod, Kembrew |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-01-01-ca-236-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029134019/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |title=The Cowboy Junkies' Addicting Vision : At its best, the band plays country music with a Velvet Underground twang |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 1, 1989 |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Hilburn, Robert |url-status=live }}</ref> They moved to [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and performed at a variety of clubs. In early 1981, the Hunger Project embarked on a multi-city tour of the United States. After that, Hunger Project moved to the United Kingdom, where they toured for three months and released the single "The Same Inside/Assembly" on their independent label, [[Latent Recordings]].<ref name="86 Promo sheet">{{cite web |url=http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch:80/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511211421/http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |title=1986 promo sheet |website=palesun's Cowboy Junkies fan pages |date=May 11, 2006 |archive-date=May 11, 2006 |access-date=April 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When Hunger Project disbanded, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal. The members – Michael Timmins on guitar, Alan Anton on bass, a drummer, and saxophonist, played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time. Germinal released two studio albums: ''Germinal 1'' (1983) and ''Din'' (1984). The music newspaper [[New Musical Express]] said Germinal "ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year." Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take, saying, "It was the ultimate release for us. But for the audience, it was quite a chore."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/cowboy-junkies |title=Cowboy Junkies |website=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> In London, they developed journeyman skills as musicians, and expanded their knowledge of music history — Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal. Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[John Coltrane]], along with the sound of early blues musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bukka White]], and [[Robert Johnson]].<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984. Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York City.<ref name="86 Promo sheet"/>

Upon their return to Toronto in 1985, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house, insulated the tiny garage, and, with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums, began exploring a new musical direction. Margo was drafted to join and recalls, "I was contemplating going on to graduate school, staying in school. That was safe. I never wanted to be a musician or be onstage."<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> Nevertheless, Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams, realizing that a female voice was what the band needed. Michael Timmins said, "I thought if you had this female voice on top of it, you could do anything you wanted."<ref name="Cold Dawn"/>

However, the slow musical tempos and whispery, hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration, but came about by necessity. Their recording studio was their repurposed garage, which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours. On their first jam session, the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour.<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> According to Michael Timmins, "We realized we had to tone down. One thing fed into the other: Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet. We began to realize, if we can get down underneath Margo, the sound will be more effective. Pete picked up brushes – he was just learning to play drums at that point. Everything sort of came down. We learned to play with less volume."<ref name="Cold Dawn"/>

When the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig, the members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Cowboy Junkies: Q&A with Margo Timmins |work=The Telegraph |date=October 17, 2011 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Chilton, Martin}}{{cbignore}}</ref> During their early gigs the band would perform at [[The Rivoli]] which had a small space in the back. The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs. Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam session.<ref name="Cold Dawn"/>

[[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer, was at their first show. According to Moore, "I was mesmerized by Margo. The very first show, people weren't paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly. Margo had her back to the audience a lot of the time."<ref name="Cold Dawn">{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-cold-grey-light-dawn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915115117/https://www.nodepression.com/article/cowboy-junkies-cold-grey-light-dawn |title=Cowboy Junkies - Cold grey light of dawn |work=No Depression |date=April 30, 2001 |archive-date=September 15, 2016 |access-date=April 26, 2018 |author=Cantin, Paul |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== 1980s ===
When the Cowboy Junkies were ready to record a studio album the band sought a like-minded recording engineer. They met Peter Moore at a dinner party, and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques, they found that Moore's interest in single-microphone recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/cowboy_junkies_reflect_on_30_y.html |title=Cowboy Junkies reflect on 30 years before Northampton show |work=Mass Live |date=April 4, 2018 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Lenker, George}}</ref> Moore had just purchased a Calrec [[Ambisonics|Ambisonic]] microphone at the wholesale price of $9,000.<ref name="Cold Dawn"/> The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the rehearsal space on June 26, 1986, and turned the garage into a recording studio. Moore arranged the group around his Calrec, jury-rigged a control room in the kitchen, and started recording.<ref name="Sound on Sound">{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/cowboy-junkies-sweet-jane |title=Cowboy Junkies 'Sweet Jane' |work=Sound on Sound |access-date=April 27, 2018 |date=October 2015 |author=Doyle, Tom}}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they revived the indie label [[Latent Recordings]] that Michael Timmins and Anton had used for their Hunger Project and Germinal works, and released ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'' in October 1986. They sold 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Barclay, Michael |author2=Jack, Ian A.D. |author3=Schneider, Jason |year=2001 |title=Have Not Been The Same: The Canrock Renaissance, 1985-1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLIiOE_jCpAC&q=cowboy+junkies+peter+moore+1985&pg=PT528 |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781554909681 }}</ref> The band then toured the US. Michael Timmins described the experience: "While touring ''Whites'' we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy. Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |title=A Look Back At….The Trinity Session (history – part 1 of 3) |website=Latent Recordings |date=November 6, 2014 |access-date=April 4, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael |archive-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427190815/http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band's next project, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), became their breakthrough. Peter Moore again produced the album. They approached the project as a reaction against the [[MIDI]]–dominated musical styles of the '80s. Moore said, "I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI. No humanity, no nothing. I'm listening to these recordings from the '50s with two or three mics and I'm going, 'Man that's real music.'" He chose the [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, Moore claimed "The Timmins Family Singers" were recording a Christmas special.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinitysession/index8.html |title=Trinity Sessions {{!}} Page 8 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The session began early on November 27, 1987. Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first, and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo's vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the album.<ref name="Sound on Sound"/>

Music critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Anthony DeCurtis]], summed up the result of the group's efforts in a four-star review of the album: "The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song. The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective – an intense, melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic world-weariness of [[the Velvet Underground]]. [...] Having good songs, the skill to convey what they have to say and, most important, a vision, the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with high-tech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously. That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiring."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |title=Rolling Stone Review of The Trinity Session |website=Junkies Fan |date=February 9, 1989 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172429/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== 1990s ===
The band's third studio album was more challenging, requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired. Yet despite the problems with the making of it, the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' (1990) remains one of their favourite albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428093807/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their debut studio album was recorded in, instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for ''The Trinity Session'' (1988). The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired, particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold. After a few hours they realized the session wasn't working out, and they left.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] rented the [[Sharon Temple]], an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon, Ontario. Michael Timmins recalls, "The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush, unlike the spareness of most of Trinity's songs, that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didn't just turn to mush on tape. Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined. As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margo's vocal mic and feedback." At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105425/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Michael Timmins states, "When we packed up and left Sharon that day I don't think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special. It had been a difficult three days and I think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable ones."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 5|website=Latent Recordings|access-date=April 27, 2018|archive-date=April 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425023811/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index5.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the Sharon tape. As the band listened, new ideas for them evolved. They also wrote additional songs. Although the band truly loved the recordings, the songs continued to develop on stage, and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band. In 2022, however, they released the Sharon session as a special edition vinyl album as well as in streaming formats.<ref>{{cite web |title=New..Lost…Album, Sharon, Available on Vinyl |url=https://cowboyjunkies.com/tag/sharon/ |website=Cowboy Junkies official website |access-date=11 November 2022}}</ref>

At the end of the tour, they decided to go into Eastern Studios in downtown Toronto and reinvent how they recorded themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 6 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085600/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index6.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' sessions went quickly and smoothly, and were recorded over several days in December 1989. Michael Timmins believes: "The beauty of the recording and one of the reasons it remains one of our favourites is that it captures the essence of the band which magically fell together during the recording of The Trinity Session and which forged its own voice, under the glare of a very intense spotlight, in the clubs and concert halls of the world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 7 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085504/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index7.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

With their next studio album, ''[[Black Eyed Man]]'' (1992), Michael Timmins wanted to explore music structure, specifically time shifts and tempo shifts; while Margo Timmins wanted to expand her singing style and her range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express {{!}} March 1992 |website=JunkiesFan.com |access-date=June 13, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza |archive-date=July 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705100955/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions, along with about twenty five other Toronto players that were known to the band, or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to include in the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128091722/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing he needed a theme to hold the album together what Michael Timmins decided upon was "love found, love lost and love betrayed - it was to be the journey of the faceless, nameless and haunted Black Eyed Man."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Black Eyed Man {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128072526/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/blackeyedman/index3.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band's fifth studio album, ''[[Pale Sun, Crescent Moon]]'' (1993) is a song cycle about male-female relationships. Margo Timmins describes the theme of the album as "there is love and there is all that conspires to steal love away."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/palesun_promo.html |title=Cowboy Junkies - Pale Sun, Crescent Moon promotional letter {{!}} RCA Records Label |website=Junkies Fan |date=October 1993 |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172347/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/palesun_promo.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Michael Timmins says, "It is a very dense and complex work both lyrically and musically."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/palesuncrescentmoon/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Pale Sun Crescent Moon |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=October 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012023645/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/palesuncrescentmoon/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Music critic, Mike Boehm, summed the album up this way: "By the album's end, Margo Timmins, the singer known for her preternatural hush, can be heard declaring herself with assertive bite: 'It's a (expletive) ole world, but this ole girl, well she ain't giving in.' While it hasn't exactly turned into a [[hard-rock]] band (the closely drawn, highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature of the band's style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording in an echoing church."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-07-ca-43281-story.html |title=A New Song and Dance for the Cowboy Junkies : Music: The group's 'Pale Sun, Crescent Moon' takes a more aggressive approach than the albums that gave the band its signature hushed sound. |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 7, 1994 |access-date=April 27, 2018 |author=Boehm, Mike}}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies' sixth studio album, ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'' (1996), was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of Toronto and away from usual routines, so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from Toronto, but would feel remote. Alan Anton recalls, "We found Rock Island, named not for music but for geology. It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace. We went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood, cooking, boating, whittling, hiking and staring into the fire, worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the setting."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 1 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327204456/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> When the Junkies went to record the songs, they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could "find a studio which would approximate the vibe of Rock Island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland." They found a big-porched southern house in [[Athens, Georgia]] that fit their needs. The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995. The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but state-of-the-art studio, and the band settled in quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 3|website=Latent Recordings|access-date=April 28, 2018|archive-date=February 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203191541/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies' last studio album of the decade is an [[alternative country]] album, ''[[Miles from Our Home]]'' (1998). Wanting to repeat the process of writing and creating used for ''[[Lay It Down (Cowboy Junkies album)|Lay It Down]]'', Michael Timmins found a house near a [[gristmill]] on a pond, a couple hours drive from Toronto, where he spent six months writing songs. During that time, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down to work on songs. Then Michael wrote more, until the songs were worked out and ready to record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |title=Miles From Our Home {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 13, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227103329/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/index2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> On New Year's Day in 1997, just as Timmins was planning the album, the band heard that [[Townes Van Zandt]] had died. Van Zandt was a friend of the band, had toured with them in their bus in 1990, and was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael. On the day that Michael Timmins had heard that Van Zandt had died he wrote the first draft of "Blue Guitar", "as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/miles/ |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Miles From Our Home |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref>

=== 2000s ===
Throughout their career, Cowboy Junkies have approached each studio album to see where they can change or improve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: The Way They Groove Together {{!}} Music Express |website=Junkies Fan |date=March 1992 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Finlay, Liza |archive-date=July 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705100955/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/musicexpress.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Open (Cowboy Junkies album)|Open]]'', which was released on May 15, 2001,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r530810/review |title=Open - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> follows in that tradition. While they were on a tour to support their live album ''[[Waltz Across America]]'', which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule, they began working on new material. They added two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing the songs to evolve on stage. During breaks, they would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith's studio, Chemical Sound, to live record material they had created.  Being able to set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an album's worth of songs in a set recording period. On each visit, they would record two or three songs. They also took the opportunity to re-record songs. After the band had recorded fifteen tracks, they listened and decided they had the songs they needed, with two additional songs recorded at [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]]'s home studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Open |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327204516/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[One Soul Now]]'' (2004) was recorded over the course of a year, from October 2002 to October 2003. Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected. When the band returned home after their Open Tour, they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed The Clubhouse. This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |title=Cowboy Junkies One Soul Now |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709235334/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies next project was ''[[Early 21st Century Blues]]'', which was recorded February through March 2005, and released in August of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r787136 |title=Early 21st Century Blues - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> It was begun a few months after their previous tour. The theme for the album was war, violence, fear, greed, ignorance, or loss, and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people. This album was unique in that John Timmins recorded with his siblings, playing guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/21century/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Early 21st Century Blues |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710001553/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/21century/main_content.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[At the End of Paths Taken]]'' was released on April 9, 2007. Michael Timmins wrote songs that "reflect the complex, frustrating, edifying, and conflict-ridden web of relationships that constitute the family, from nuclear to extended to global. He is a parent, and a son with aging parents. He plays with his siblings in the Cowboy Junkies."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/at-the-end-of-paths-taken-mw0000479835|title=At the End of Paths Taken - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Jurek, Thom}}</ref> Timmins blends his alternative country music sound with ferocious guitar work on "My Little Basquiat" and "Mountain". At times Timmins sounds as if he has lost control of his guitar playing, "until you realize there's not a stray note to be found. . . . Timmons' [sic] guitar playing has grown more aggressive over the years."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-cowboy-junkies-at-the-end-of-paths-taken-2496247883.html |title=The Cowboy Junkies: At the End of Paths Taken |work=PopMatters |date=June 5, 2007 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Gilstrap, Andrew}}</ref>

For the twentieth anniversary of their breakthrough studio album, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), the Cowboy Junkies reinterpreted the album to highlight what twenty years of performing experience brought to the songs. In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies, and whose work and lives were affected by the album. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], and [[Ryan Adams]]. Each does lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Merchant on "To Love Is to Bury", Chesnutt on "Postcard Blues", and Adams on "200 More Miles"). They also perform on other tracks. Jeff Bird, a [[session musician]] who has appeared on virtually every Cowboy Junkies album, is also included in the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Trinity Revisited |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709214735/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinity/main_content.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> In order to create the same atmosphere, they kept rehearsal to a minimum, getting together for a few hours a day before the recording. The guest musicians worked with the band to re-imagine the songs, making suggestions, trying out fresh nuances. The album contains a performance film, ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', and a documentary film, ''Trinity Session Revisited''. Directors Pierre and François Lamoureux, produced and recorded the album and the films. Although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album, the directors placed the musicians in a circle and used a surround microphone, augmented the recording with ten close-mics to record them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/cowboy-junkies-go-back-church-365949 |title=Cowboy Junkies Go Back to Church |work=Mix |date=February 1, 2008 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Jackson, Blair}}</ref>

=== 2010s ===
''[[The Nomad Series]]'' (2017) is a set of four studio albums that was released over three years from 2010 to 2012. ''The Nomad Series'' is not based on a particular theme regarding music, but are based on a set of paintings by their friend, artist [[Enrique Martinez Celaya]]. The group found the name appropriate, since they have been touring for over 30 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/136596-become-what-you-are-a-conversation-with-cowboy-junkies-michael-timmi/ |title=Become What You Are: A Conversation with Cowboy Junkies' Michael Timmins |work=PopMatters |date=February 15, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Henderson, Stuart}}</ref> The Junkies had no recording contract when they created ''the Nomad Series'', which freed them up to be experimental with their music, to avoid categorizing the planned releases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/wilderness-cowboy-junkies |title=The Wilderness by The Cowboy Junkies |work=No Depression |date=March 1, 2012 |access-date=April 29, 2018 |author=Heselgrave, Doug}}</ref>

The first album in the series is ''[[Renmin Park (album)|Renmin Park]]'' (2010), which is based on ideas the band's principal songwriter, Michael Timmins, got while living in China for three months with his wife and three children. Two of his children were adopted from China, and during their stay they visited the birth village of his adopted daughters. Most of their time was spent in [[Jingjiang]], situated on the [[Yangtze]] River about two hours' drive from [[Shanghai]].<ref name="Renmin Park">{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |title=Renmin Park |website=Latent Recordings |date=March 2010 |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael |archive-date=April 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429155137/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/renmin/renmin_park.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The music that inspired Timmins most during the visit was found at Renmin Park, where a variety of musicians would gather throughout the day, bringing their erhus, pipas, shangxians, various percussion instruments; and a mix of singers performed. Timmins found most of the musicians outstanding, he thought the singers were good because they all performed with passion. About halfway through the visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and became Timmins' friend. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene.<ref name="Renmin Park"/>

Michael asked his brother, Peter Timmins, to send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, and to use his imagination. The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart. ''Renmin Park'' is also a thank-you letter to the people of the city that so kindly welcomed him and his family.<ref name="Renmin Park"/>

On December 25, 2009, at the age of 45, Cowboy Junkies friend, [[Vic Chesnutt]], died from an overdose of [[muscle relaxant]]s.

On October 14, 2011, music critic Jason Lent began his review of ''[[Sing in My Meadow]]'' with this observation, "When [[R.E.M.]] called it quits, the band talked about walking away having maintained their artistic integrity throughout a 30-year career. As Cowboy Junkies pass the quarter century mark, the Toronto band must rest well at night. The band's consistent work flies under the radar more times than not and the band sounds content with keeping it that way." He continues, "One of the band's live staples in recent years is "Hunted" from 1994's ''Pale Sun Crescent Moon''. Revisiting the song here, the original sounds frail and timid in comparison.

''[[The Wilderness (Cowboy Junkies album)|The Wilderness]]'' was released on March 27, 2012,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-wilderness-the-nomad-series-vol-4-mw0002310883 |title=The Wilderness: The Nomad Series, Vol. 4 - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 29, 2018}}</ref> and is the fourth and final entry of ''The Nomad Series''. The album reflects the introspective nature of winter. The album is a return to the folk vibe the band played with in the late 80s and early 90s. Songwriter Michael Timmins states: "I started to think in terms of an album of songs reflecting on the lives of characters I'd written about early in the bands career and bringing those characters . . . into the future to see where their lives were at now." About his lyrics, Timmins says: "Some of those songs have little touch points where . . . you can see how they connect to earlier songs -- even character's names and stuff pops into them, and that's intentional."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/502669/cowboy-junkies-getting-back-to-the-folk-vibe-on-the-wilderness |title=Cowboy Junkies Getting Back To 'The Folk Vibe' on 'The Wilderness' |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=March 8, 2012 |access-date=June 21, 2018 |author=Graff, Gary}}</ref> The style of the songs on the album comes closer to the typical Cowboy Junkies music, more than the other albums in ''The Nomad series''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/cowboy_junkies-wilderness_2|title=Cowboy Junkies The Wilderness|website=exclaim.ca|access-date=April 29, 2018}}</ref>

The Cowboy Junkies studio album, ''[[All That Reckoning]]'', was released on July 13, 2018. In an interview about the upcoming album with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', guitarist and songwriter Michael Timmins said, "There's a lot of pressures and a lot of crumbling of institutions, very little foundation to put one's feet on again, especially at an older age. You sort of expect things to be there and realize, 'My God, what I thought was a standard, whether it be an institution or a way of dealing with people in our society, is disappearing."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8421364/cowboy-junkies-all-that-reckoning-premiere |title=Cowboy Junkies Return With 'All That Reckoning,' Title Track From New Album: Premiere |magazine=Billboard |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=May 10, 2018 |author=Graff, Gary}}</ref> In 2019, they joined the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Volmers |first1=Eric |title=Chilliwack, Andy Kim, Cowboy Junkies, Bobby Curtola honoured in first Canadian Music Hall of Fame induction ceremony |url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/local-arts/chilliwack-andy-kim-cowboy-junkies-bobby-curtola-honoured-in-first-canadian-music-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony |access-date=11 December 2022 |work=Calgary Herald |date=27 October 2019}}</ref>

=== Concerts and television performances ===
Michael Timmins states that "By the Spring of 1990 we had been on the road for close to two years straight, trying to stay right-side-up in the whirlwind of attention that was created by the release of ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988) and the subsequent release of ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' (1990). We had accumulated, literally, trunks full of press clippings from around the world, but most importantly we had built up our confidence on stage. Margo was emerging as a true front-person and we were gelling as band. In May of that year we landed in the London for our first full fledge UK tour and were greeted with much adulation and interest. The tour was a tremendous success on all levels and thankfully the [[BBC]] was there to record one of the shows at [[Royal Exchange, Manchester#Theatre|The Royal Exchange Theatre]] in [[Manchester]]."<ref>{{cite web |author=Timmins |first=Michael |title=Cowboy Junkies :: In The Time Before Llamas |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/llamas/main_content.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429155919/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/llamas/main_content.html |archive-date=April 29, 2018 |access-date=April 29, 2018 |website=Latent Recordings}}</ref>

'''Creedence Clearwater Revival''', commonly abbreviated as '''CCR''' or simply '''Creedence''', was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[El Cerrito, California]]. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter [[John Fogerty]], his brother, rhythm guitarist [[Tom Fogerty]], bassist [[Stu Cook]], and drummer [[Doug Clifford]]. These members had played together since 1959, first as the '''Blue Velvets''' and later as the '''Golliwogs''', before settling on Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1967.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cavanagh |first=David |url= http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/creedence-clearwater-revival-the-full-story-by-john-fogerty-stu-cook-and-doug-clifford-6563 |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival – the full story, by John Fogerty, Stu Cook and Doug Clifford |work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=July 18, 2014 |access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> The band's most prolific and successful period between 1969 and 1971 produced fourteen consecutive Top 10 singles (many of which were [[double A-side]]s) and five consecutive Top 10 albums in the United States, two of which – ''[[Green River (album)|Green River]]'' (1969) and ''[[Cosmo's Factory]]'' (1970) – topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. The band performed at the 1969 [[Woodstock]] festival in [[Upstate New York]], and was the first major act signed to appear there.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woodstock |url=https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/woodstock |website=history.com |publisher=History.com Editors |access-date=24 March 2021}}</ref>

CCR disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had quit the band the year before, and John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in lawsuits among the former bandmates. John's disagreements with [[Fantasy Records]] owner [[Saul Zaentz]] led to more court cases and John refused to perform with the two other surviving members of the band &ndash; Tom had died in 1990 &ndash; at Creedence's 1993 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="rockhall.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/creedence-clearwater-revival|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival|publisher=Rockhall.com|access-date=March 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/john-fogerty-explains-creedence-clearwater-revivals-hall-of-fame-meltdown-196247/|title=John Fogerty Explains CCR's Hall of Fame Meltdown|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 6, 2015}}</ref> Though the band has never publicly reunited, John continues to perform CCR songs as part of his solo act, while Cook and Clifford performed as [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] from 1995 to 2020.

==History==
===Early career: The Blue Velvets (1959–1964)===
[[John Fogerty]], [[Doug Clifford]], and [[Stu Cook]] met at Portola Junior High School in [[El Cerrito, California]]. Calling themselves the Blue Velvets, the trio played [[instrumental]]s and "jukebox standards",<ref name=rs30>{{Cite news|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|author-link=Ben Fong-Torres|title=Creedence C'water At the Hop|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|page=9|date=April 5, 1969|issue=30|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/creedence-cwater-at-the-hop-186659/}}</ref> and backed John's older brother [[Tom Fogerty|Tom]] at recordings and performances before he joined the band. The band had also released three singles, the second of which was picked up by [[Casey Kasem]], who worked at KEWB, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. In 1964 they signed with [[Fantasy Records]], an independent jazz label in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/article/fantasy-studios-alive-and-well-in-berkeley.html |title=Fantasy Studios: Alive and Well in Berkeley |publisher=Crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com |date=August 6, 2008 |access-date=March 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009135750/http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/Article/Fantasy-Studios-Alive-and-Well-in-Berkeley.html |archive-date=October 9, 2009}}</ref> The band was attracted to the label after hearing [[Vince Guaraldi]]'s instrumental "[[Cast Your Fate to the Wind]]", which the label had released to national success.<ref name="Lembo">{{cite book |last=Moskowitz |first=David V. |title=The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World p. 166 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4408-0340-6}}</ref>

===Vision and the Golliwogs (1964–1967)===
For the band's first release, Fantasy co-owner Max Weiss renamed the group The Golliwogs (after the children's literary character [[Golliwog]]). Prior to the Golliwog name, Weiss had renamed them Vision. Bandmembers' roles changed during this period: Cook switched from piano to bass guitar and Tom Fogerty from lead vocals to rhythm guitar; John became the band's lead vocalist and primary songwriter. In Tom's words: "I could sing, but John had a sound!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/05/14/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-revival/ |last=Sullivan |first=James |title=John Fogerty Sued for Plagiarizing ... Himself: Twisted Tales |date=May 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629055303/http://www.spinner.com/2010/05/14/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-revival/ |archive-date=June 29, 2013}}</ref>  For their work with this band, Tom took on the name "Rann Wild", and John became "Toby Green".  Both sides of each of the group's first six singles (issued between 1964 and 1966) were credited to the writing team of Wild/Green.  

In 1966, John Fogerty and Doug Clifford were [[Conscription in the United States| drafted into the U.S. armed forces]]; Fogerty joined the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]] while Clifford joined the [[United States Coast Guard Reserve|U.S. Coast Guard Reserve]]. Speaking of his experience in the [[US Army]] Fogerty has said: "I would become delirious and go into a trance. And I started narrating this story to myself, which was the song '[[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|Porterville]]'."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules. I wasn't embarrassed that I was ambitious' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview |work=The Guardian |date=May 29, 2013 |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> John Fogerty eventually took control of the group by singing lead vocals and blossoming into a multi-instrumentalist who played keyboards, harmonica, and saxophone in addition to lead guitar. By 1967, he was [[Record producer|producing]] the group's recordings, although without credit.  The group's final single, "Porterville", failed to chart (like every other Golliwogs recording) but the exact same recording was very shortly thereafter issued as a track by Creedence Clearwater Revival on that group's first album.

===Name change to Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968–1969)===
In 1967, [[Saul Zaentz]] bought Fantasy Records and offered the band a chance to record an album. Having hated the name "The Golliwogs" from day one, the band decided on their own name, Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), which they took in January 1968.<ref name=pc54>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19837/m1/ |title=Show 54 - Hail, Hail, Rock 'N' Roll: Getting back to rock's funky, essential essence. [Part 3]}}</ref> According to interviews with the band members 20 years later, the name's elements came from three sources: Tom Fogerty's friend Credence Newball, whose name they changed to form the word ''Creedence'' (as in [[creed]]);  a television commercial for [[Olympia Brewing Company]] ("clear water"); and the four members' renewed commitment to their band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.comhttp//arch-timesmachine-fe-prd-40741-2-575473780.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/timesmachine/1995/10/15/060380.html?pageNumber=236|title=MUSIC MUSIC;The Rolling, Uh, Pebbles?|access-date=June 19, 2023|website=Timesmachine.nytimes.com}}</ref> Rejected contenders for the band's name included "Muddy Rabbit", "[[Gossamer Wump]]", and "Creedence Nuball and the Ruby"; however, the last was the starting point from which the band derived their final name. Cook described the name as "weirder than [[Buffalo Springfield]] or [[Jefferson Airplane]]".<ref name="isbn"/> In early 1968, the band began appearing regularly at local [[San Francisco]] area clubs and venues including [[Deno and Carlo's]], the [[Avalon Ballroom]], and the [[Fillmore West]]. Later that year, the band began touring nationally across the US and made their first appearances in [[New York City]] at the [[Fillmore East]].

By 1968, [[AM radio]] programmers around the U.S. took note when CCR's [[cover version|cover]] of the 1956 [[rockabilly]] song<ref name=pc54/> "[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]" received substantial airplay in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and on [[Chicago]]'s [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/il/wls101468.htm|title= WLS890 Hit Parade|work=Mike Gallant|date=1968-10-14|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> It was the band's second single, its first to reach the [[Top 40]] (No. 11), and its only Top 40 hit not written by John Fogerty. Two other singles were released from their May 1968 debut self titled album: a cover of [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]]'s "[[I Put a Spell on You]]" (No. 58) and "Porterville" (released on the Scorpio label with writing credited to "T. Spicebush Swallowtail"), written during Fogerty's time in the Army Reserve.

=== Peak success: 1969–1970 ===
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival performing on stage at the Forum.jpg|thumb|CCR in concert in [[Inglewood, California]], December 1969]]
After their breakthrough, CCR began touring and started work on their second album, ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]'' (released January 1969), at [[RCA]] Studios in Los Angeles. A No.&nbsp;7 platinum hit, the record was their first in a string of hit albums and singles that continued uninterrupted for two years. The single "[[Proud Mary]]", backed with "[[Born on the Bayou]]", reached No.&nbsp;2 on the national ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart. The former would eventually become the group's most-covered song, with some 100 versions by other artists to date, including the No. 4 1971 hit by [[Ike & Tina Turner]], two years to the week after the original peaked. John cites this song as being the result of high spirits on gaining his discharge from the Army Reserve.<ref name=pc54/> The album also featured a cover of the rock & roll classic "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]"<ref name=pc54/> and the band's nine-minute live-show closer, "Keep On Chooglin{{'"}}.

Months later, during April 1969, "[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]" backed with "[[Lodi (Creedence Clearwater Revival song)|Lodi]]", was released and peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in the US. In the United Kingdom, "Bad Moon Rising" spent three weeks at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] during September and October 1969, becoming the band's only number one single in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popexpresso.com/2018/09/19/creedence-clearwater-revival-scored-their-only-u-k-no-1-single-with-bad-moon-rising|title = Creedence Clearwater Revival scored their only U.K. No 1 single with "Bad Moon Rising|work = Pop Expresso| date=September 18, 2023 }}</ref> The band's third album, ''[[Green River (album)|Green River]]'', followed in August 1969, was their first album to top the [[Billboard 200]], and went gold along with the single "[[Green River (song)|Green River]]", which again reached No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard charts. The B-side of "Green River", "[[Commotion (song)|Commotion]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;30 and the band's emphasis on covers of their old favorites continued with "[[Night Time Is the Right Time]]". CCR continued to tour constantly with performances in July 1969 at the [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta Pop Festival]] and in August 1969 at the [[Woodstock Festival]]. Their set was not included in the [[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock film]] or soundtrack because John felt the band's performance was subpar. Four tracks from the event (out of a total of eleven) were eventually included in the 1994 commemorative box set ''[[Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music#Disc two|Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music]]''. Cook, however, held an opposing view, saying, "The performances are classic CCR and I'm still amazed by the number of people who don't even know we were one of the headliners at Woodstock '69."<ref name="Woodstock quote">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&q=I%27m+still+amazed+by+the+number+of+people+who+don%27t+even+know+we+were+one+of+the+headliners+at+Woodstock+%2769&pg=PA65|title=The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival Page 65|author=Hank Bordowitz|publisher= Chicago Review Press, Incorporated|location=Chicago, Illinois|year=2007|page=65|isbn=978-1-55652-661-9|access-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref> John later complained the act that preceded them, the [[Grateful Dead]], had put the audience to sleep; as John scanned the audience he saw a "[[Dante's Inferno|Dante]] scene, just bodies from hell, all intertwined and asleep, covered with mud".<ref name="isbn">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&pg=PA64 |title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival |author=Hank Bordowitz |publisher=Chicago Review Press, Incorporated |location=Chicago, Illinois |year=2007 |page=64 |isbn=978-1-55652-661-9 |access-date=August 27, 2011}}</ref>

{{Blockquote|Creedence Clearwater Revival ... were progressive and anachronistic at the same time. An unapologetic throwback to the golden era of rock and roll, they broke ranks with their peers on the progressive, psychedelic San Francisco scene. Their approach was basic and uncompromising, holding true to the band members' working-class origins. The term "roots rock" had not yet been invented when Creedence came along, but in essence, they defined it, drawing inspiration from the likes of [[Little Richard]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chuck Berry]], and the artisans of soul at [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]]. In so doing, Creedence Clearwater Revival became the standard bearers and foremost celebrants of homegrown American music.

After Woodstock, CCR were busy honing material for a fourth album, ''[[Willy and the Poor Boys]]'', their second top 3 LP, released in November 1969. "[[Down on the Corner]]" and "[[Fortunate Son]]", both of which they performed on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on November 16, 1969,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/the-ed-sullivan-show/creedence-clearwater-revival---jerry-lee-lewis/episode/106884/summary.html|title=The Ed Sullivan Show: Creedence Clearwater Revival / Jerry Lee Lewis|publisher=TV.com|access-date=May 8, 2009|archive-date=June 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604114924/http://www.tv.com/the-ed-sullivan-show/creedence-clearwater-revival---jerry-lee-lewis/episode/106884/summary.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> climbed to No.&nbsp;3 and No.&nbsp;14, respectively, by year's end.  The album was CCR in standard mode, featuring Fogerty originals and two reworked [[Lead Belly]] covers, "[[Cotton Fields]]" and "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]".  The year 1969 had been a remarkable chart year for the band:  three Top Ten albums, four hit singles (three charting at No.&nbsp;2 and one at No.&nbsp;3) with three additional charting [[B-side]]s.

CCR released another double A-side hit, "[[Travelin' Band]]"/"[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]", in January 1970. The speedy "Travelin' Band", with a strong Little Richard sound, however, bore enough similarities to "Good Golly, Miss Molly" to warrant a lawsuit by the song's publisher; it was eventually [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] out of court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1971-john-fogerty-is-sued-by-the-owners-of-specialty-records-their-suit-accuses/ |title=Rock History - 1971 – John Fogerty is sued by the owners of Specialty Records. |publisher=Thisdayinrock.com |date=October 14, 1971 |access-date=October 24, 2013 |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016232331/http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1971-john-fogerty-is-sued-by-the-owners-of-specialty-records-their-suit-accuses/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The song ultimately topped out at No.&nbsp;2. The band also recorded its January 31, 1970, live performance at the [[Oakland Coliseum Arena]], which would later be marketed as a live album and television special. In February, CCR were featured on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', although only John was interviewed in the accompanying article.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/creedenceclearwaterrevival/photos/collection/photo/1 |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival Photo Gallery : Rolling Stone |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=February 21, 1970 |access-date=May 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412090626/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/creedenceclearwaterrevival/photos/collection/photo/1 |archive-date=April 12, 2009}}</ref>

In April 1970, CCR were set to begin their first European tour. To support the upcoming live dates, John wrote "[[Up Around the Bend]]" and "[[Run Through the Jungle]]"; the single reached No.&nbsp;4 that spring. The band returned to [[Wally Heider Studios]] in San Francisco in June to record ''[[Cosmo's Factory]]''. The album contained the earlier Top 10 hits "Travelin' Band" and "Up Around the Bend" plus popular album tracks such as the opener "Ramble Tamble".

''Cosmo's Factory'' was released in July 1970, and it was number one in the US for nine weeks. It was released along with the band's fifth and final No.&nbsp;2 national hit, "[[Lookin' Out My Back Door]]"/"[[Long as I Can See the Light]]". Although they topped some international charts and local radio countdowns, CCR have the distinction of having had five No.&nbsp;2 singles without ever having had a No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Hot 100]], the most of any group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/specials/hot100/charts/most-no2s-wo1s.shtml |title=Most No.&nbsp;2 Hits Without Reaching No.&nbsp;1 By Artist |work=[[Billboard Magazine]] |format=PHP |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228031342/http://www.billboard.com/specials/hot100/charts/most-no2s-wo1s.shtml |archive-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref> Their five No.&nbsp;2 singles [[Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-two singles|were exceeded]] only by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (six), [[Taylor Swift]] (seven), and [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] (nine), and tied with [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Carpenters]].  Conversely, on station WLS-AM the band had three No.&nbsp;1's, four No.&nbsp;3's, and two No.&nbsp;4's, but no No.&nbsp;2 singles, with "Down on the Corner" the only top ten CCR single registering the same peak position (No.&nbsp;3) on the Hot 100 and on WLS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/il/wlsyear.htm|title=WLS Year Index|publisher=Oldiesloon|date=1969–1971|access-date=December 26, 2011}}</ref>

Other cuts on the ''Cosmo's Factory'' album included an 11-minute jam of [[Marvin Gaye]]’s 1968 cover of "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" (a minor hit when an edited version was released as a single in 1976), and a nearly note-for-note homage to [[Roy Orbison]]'s "Ooby Dooby". The album was their biggest seller, going to No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 album charts and No.&nbsp;11 on ''Billboard's'' Soul Albums chart.

''[[Pendulum (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|Pendulum]]'', released in December 1970, was another top seller, spawning a Top 10 hit with "[[Have You Ever Seen The Rain?]]" John played the [[Hammond organ|Hammond B3 organ]] on many of the ''Pendulum'' tracks, notably in "Have You Ever Seen The Rain?", in recognition of the deep respect and influence of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], with whom the members of the band had jammed. The single's flip side, "Hey Tonight", was also a hit.

=== Tom Fogerty's departure, discord and breakup: 1971–1972 ===

[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival.jpg|thumb|CCR in 1972 after Tom Fogerty's departure; John Fogerty, Stu Cook, Doug Clifford]]

Around this time, an overwhelming perception among the other band members that John was being overly controlling and domineering was approaching a boiling point.<ref name= "Autobiography">Fogerty, John (2015). ''Fortunate Son''. New York, NY: Little, Brown and Company.</ref> Tom Fogerty decided he had enough and resigned from CCR in early 1971 after the recording of ''Pendulum'', with his departure being made public in February of that year. The remaining members initially considered replacing him but ultimately continued as a trio.

In the spring of 1971, John Fogerty, frustrated with his remaining bandmates' constant complaining that they were not allowed to write and produce their own songs,<ref name= "Autobiography"/> relented and informed Cook and Clifford that CCR would continue only by adopting a "democratic" approach: each member would now write and perform his own material with each band member contributing three songs apiece to the next album. Fogerty would only contribute guitar parts to his bandmates' songs. <ref name= "Autobiography"/>

There are conflicting views regarding Cook and Clifford's reaction to this proposed new arrangement, although everyone seemed to acknowledge that Cook and Clifford had wanted more input in CCR's artistic and business decisions. For his part, Fogerty recounts that Cook and Clifford were initially excited about this new opportunity to write and perform their own songs free of his meddling, since they had been the ones who asked for it in the first place and they only soured on the concept after the record's lack of success (Fogerty also mentions a time while recording the album when he refused Cook's request to "fix" one of his (Cook's) songs to make it sound more like other Creedence material, which may have also played a role in the band members' attitudes toward the project). <ref name= "Autobiography"/> However, other sources imply that Cook and Clifford were resistant to this approach from the start. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |access-date= February 13, 2022}}</ref> Allegedly, Fogerty at one point insisted they accept the arrangement or he would quit the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival – the full story, by John Fogerty, Stu Cook and Doug Clifford |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/creedence-clearwater-revival-the-full-story-by-john-fogerty-stu-cook-and-doug-clifford-6563/ |website=UNCUT |access-date=25 December 2023 |date=18 July 2014}}</ref> Despite the conflict, the trio put its new work ethic to the test in the studio, releasing the Top 10 single "[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]" in July 1971, backed with Cook's "Door To Door". The band toured both the U.S. and Europe that summer and fall with Cook's song a part of the live set. In spite of their continuing commercial success, relations among the three had become increasingly strained.

The band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', was released in April 1972, featuring songs written by John Fogerty, Cook and Clifford, as well as a cover of "[[Hello Mary Lou]]" (a song [[Gene Pitney]] had originally written for [[Ricky Nelson]]). Each member sang lead vocal on the songs written by that member. The album was a critical failure, considered by critics to be of inconsistent quality and lacking in cohesion. ''Rolling Stone'' reviewer [[Jon Landau]] deemed it "relative to a group's established level of performance, the worst album I have ever heard from a major rock band".<ref name="landau-review">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/mardi-gras-19760526 |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival: ''Mardi Gras'': Music Reviews: Rolling Stone |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 1972|access-date=May 8, 2009}}</ref> The sales of ''Mardi Gras'' were weaker than previous albums, ultimately peaking at No.&nbsp;12, though it still became the band's seventh consecutive studio album to be certified Gold. Fogerty's "[[Someday Never Comes]]", backed with Clifford's "Tearin' Up the Country", also cracked the U.S. Top 40.

By this point, Fogerty was not only at direct odds with his bandmates but he had also come to see the group's relationship with Fantasy Records as onerous, feeling that Zaentz had reneged on his promise to give the band a better contract. Cook&mdash;who held a degree in business&mdash;claimed that because of poor judgment on Fogerty's part, CCR had to abide by the worst record deal of any major U.S. recording artist. Despite the relatively poor reception of ''Mardi Gras'' and deteriorated relationships among the remaining band members, CCR embarked upon a two-month, 20-date U.S. tour. However, on October 16, 1972—less than six months after the tour ended—Fantasy Records and the band officially announced its disbanding.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7A4EAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7A4EAAAAMBAJ/page/n62 16]|quote=creedence splits.|title=Billboard –|via=[[Internet Archive]]|date=October 28, 1972|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|access-date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> CCR never formally reunited after the breakup, although Cook and Clifford eventually started the band [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]]. John Fogerty later commented on the demise of CCR in a 1997 edition of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] magazine ''Pop'':

{{blockquote|I was alone when I made that [CCR] music. I was alone when I made the arrangements, I was alone when I added background vocals, guitars and some other stuff. I was alone when I produced and mixed the albums. The other guys showed up only for rehearsals and the days we made the actual recordings. For me Creedence was like sitting on a time bomb. We'd had decent successes with our cover of "Susie Q" and with [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|the first album]], when we went into the studio to cut "Proud Mary." It was the first time we were in a real Hollywood studio, RCA's Los Angeles studio, and the problems started immediately. The other guys in the band insisted on writing songs for the new album, they had opinions on the arrangements, they wanted to sing. They went as far as adding background vocals to "Proud Mary," and it sounded awful. They used [[tambourine]]s, and it sounded no better.

That's when I understood I had a choice to make. At that point in time we were just a one hit wonder, and "Susie Q" hadn't really been that big a hit. Either this [the new album] would be a success, something really big, or we might as well start working at the car wash again. There was a big row. We went to an Italian restaurant and I remember that I very clearly told the others that I for one didn't want to go back to the car wash again. Now we had to make the best possible album and it wasn't important who did what, as long as the result was the very best we could achieve. And of course I was the one who should do it. I don't think the others really understood what I meant, but at least I could manage the situation the way I wanted. The result was eight million-selling double-sided singles in a row and six albums, who all went platinum. And ''[[Melody Maker]]'' had us as the best band in the world. That was after [[break-up of the Beatles|the Beatles split]], but still. ... And I was the one who had created all this. Despite that, I don't think they understood what I was talking about. ... They were obsessed with the idea of more control and more influence. So finally the bomb exploded and we never worked together again.<ref name="1997-98Interviews">{{cite web|url=http://riverising.tripod.com/john-bluemoonswamp/bmsinterviews.html?stop_mobi=yes|title=Blue Moon Swamp Interview|work=POP |year=1997|access-date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

==Post-breakup==

===John Fogerty===
[[File:John Fogerty at the 2011 Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest.jpg|upright|thumb|John Fogerty performing in 2011]]
In 1973, John Fogerty began his solo career with ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'', his one-man band collection of country and gospel songs. Under his old CCR contract, however, Fogerty owed Fantasy eight more records. In the end, he refused to work for the label. The impasse was resolved only when [[Asylum Records]]' [[David Geffen]] bought Fogerty's contract for $1 million. In 1975 he released his only Asylum album, the self-titled ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]''. His next major hit was ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', a chart-topping success in 1985. On tour in 1986, however, Fogerty suffered complaints over his steadfast refusal to perform CCR songs and suffered with recurring vocal problems which he blamed on having to testify in court. Fogerty's explanation for not playing CCR material was that he would have had to pay performance royalties to copyright holder Zaentz, and that it was "too painful" to revisit the music of his past.

With the ''Centerfield'' album, Fogerty also found himself entangled in new, tit-for-tat lawsuits with Zaentz over the song "[[The Old Man Down The Road]]" which was, according to Zaentz, a blatant re-write of Fogerty's own 1970 CCR hit "Run Through the Jungle". Since Fogerty had traded his rights to CCR's songs in 1980 to cancel his remaining contractual obligations, Fantasy now owned the rights to "Run Through the Jungle" and sued Fogerty essentially for [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] himself. While a jury ruled in Fogerty's favor, he did settle a [[defamation]] suit filed by Zaentz over the songs "Mr. Greed" and "Zanz Kant Danz". Fogerty was forced to edit the recording, changing the "Zanz" reference to "Vanz".

On February 19, 1987, at the [[Palomino Club (North Hollywood)|Palomino Club]] ([[North Hollywood]]) in Los Angeles, Fogerty broke his self-imposed ban on performing CCR hits. [[Bob Dylan]] and [[George Harrison]] (along with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Jesse Ed Davis]]) had joined him onstage, admonishing, "If you don't, the whole world's gonna think 'Proud Mary' is [[Tina Turner]]'s song." At a 1987 [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] benefit concert for Vietnam veterans, Fogerty finally ran through the list of CCR hits, beginning with "Born on the Bayou" and ending with "Proud Mary". In 1986 he also released his second Warner Bros. album, ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]''. Fogerty retreated from music again in the late 1980s but returned in 1997 with the [[Grammy]]-winning ''[[Blue Moon Swamp]]''. Fogerty still tours frequently and now performs CCR classics alongside his solo material.

===Tom Fogerty===
Tom Fogerty released several solo albums, though none reached the success of CCR. His 1974 solo album ''[[Zephyr National]]'' was the last to feature the four original CCR band members on the track "Mystic Isle of Avalon", although John recorded his parts separately. Several tracks sound very much like the CCR style, particularly the aptly titled "Joyful Resurrection". His album ''Excalibur'' featured all four members of The Jerry Garcia Band (who recorded live albums for Fantasy)... Garcia played lead guitar to Tom's rhythm guitar, and has since become a popular cult album.

Tom Fogerty died at his home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in September 1990 of an [[AIDS]] complication, which he contracted via a tainted blood transfusion he received while undergoing back surgery. Tom and John barely reconciled before Tom's death, and in the [[eulogy]] that he delivered at Tom's funeral, John said, "We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview|title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules. I wasn't embarrassed that I was ambitious'|year=2013|work=theguardian.com|access-date=July 31, 2013}}</ref>

===Stu Cook and Doug Clifford===
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revisited in concert @ Utah (May 29).jpg|alt=|thumb|CCR's rhythm section formed [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] in 1995]]
Junior high school friends Doug Clifford and Stu Cook continued to work together following the demise of CCR both as session players and members of the [[Don Harrison Band]]. They also founded Factory Productions, a mobile recording service in the Bay Area. Clifford released a solo record, ''[[Cosmo (Doug Clifford album)|Cosmo]]'', in 1972. Cook produced artist [[Roky Erickson]]'s ''The Evil One'' and was a bassist with the popular country act [[Southern Pacific (band)|Southern Pacific]] in the 1980s.

Clifford also produced ''Groovers Paradise'' for former [[Sir Douglas Quintet]] and Texas Tornados frontman [[Doug Sahm]]. Both Clifford and Cook played on the album which was released on Warner Bros. in 1974. Clifford continued to perform and record with Sahm through the 1980s.

Following a relatively long period of musical inactivity, Cook and Clifford formed [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] in 1995 with several well-known musicians. Revisited continues to tour globally performing the original band's classics. John's 1997 injunction forced Creedence Clearwater Revisited to temporarily change its name to "Cosmo's Factory", but the courts later ruled in Cook's and Clifford's favor.

===Fantasy Records===
After CCR, Fantasy Records released several greatest-hits packages such as 1972's ''[[Creedence Gold]]'', 1973's ''[[More Creedence Gold]]'' and 1975's ''[[Pre-Creedence]]'', a compilation album of the Golliwogs' early recordings. Fantasy also released the highly successful double album ''[[Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits|Chronicle]]'', a collection of Creedence's twenty hit singles, in 1976. Several years later, the label released a live recording entitled ''The Royal Albert Hall Concert''. Contrary to its title, the 1970 performance was recorded in [[Oakland, California]], not at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]]. Subsequent issues of the original 1981 album have been retitled simply ''[[The Concert (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|The Concert]]''. Another double album of their best material was issued in 1986 as ''[[Chronicle: Volume Two]]''.

The success of CCR made Fantasy and Zaentz a great deal of money, and Fantasy built a new headquarters building in 1971 at 2600 Tenth Street in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warehamproperties.com/press/musichistory.htm|title=Wareham Development|publisher=Warehamproperties.com|date=February 13, 2007|access-date=May 8, 2009|archive-date=July 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725094129/http://www.warehamproperties.com/press/musichistory.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> Zaentz also used his wealth to produce a number of successful films, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]] winners ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.

In 2004, Zaentz sold Fantasy to [[Concord Records]]. John Fogerty then purchased from Concord a majority stake in the global rights to the Creedence Clearwater Revival songs he had written.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Millman |first1=Ethan |title=Five Decades Later, John Fogerty Finally Gains Ownership of CCR Catalog |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/john-fogerty-ccr-songs-deal-1234659981/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=12 January 2023}}</ref> In 2005, the label released ''[[The Long Road Home (album)|The Long Road Home]]'', a collection of CCR and Fogerty solo classics. After ''[[Revival (John Fogerty album)|Revival]]'' came out on the Fantasy label in October 2007 but before his following album ''[[Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]'' (a sequel to his 1973 album) was issued in 2009, Fogerty switched from Fantasy to his own label, Fortunate Son Records, distributed by [[Verve Forecast Records]].

=== Reunions ===
The original CCR lineup reunited just once for a performance after their breakup, at Tom Fogerty's wedding on October 19, 1980. Six years prior, all four members were present on the song "Mystic Aisle Avalon" on Tom's 1974 album ''[[Zephyr National]]'', but John recorded his parts separately from everyone else. John, Cook, and Clifford played at their 20th [[El Cerrito High School]] reunion in 1983, but as their original incarnation, the Blue Velvets. In the 1980s and 1990s, new rounds of lawsuits between the band members, as well as against their former management, deepened their animosities. By the time CCR was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993, John refused to perform with Cook and Clifford. The pair were barred from the stage, while John played with an all-star band that included [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]]. Tom's widow Tricia had expected a CCR reunion and even brought the urn containing her husband's ashes to the ceremony. Furious, Cook and Clifford, who were seated with their families at a table across the room from Fogerty's, walked out of the ballroom just as the performance began, and would later write separate letters to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's board of directors, saying it was "hurtful" and "insulting" to allow the performance to continue without them.<ref name="latimesarticle">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-01-31-ca-868-story.html|title=These Guys' Bad Moon Rose a Loooong Time Ago|date=January 31, 1993|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 11, 2021}}</ref>

In a July 2011 interview with the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', John admitted that he would at least be willing to consider reuniting with Cook and Clifford:

{{blockquote|Years ago, I looked at people and I was so full of some sort of emotion and I'd say, 'Absolutely not!' ... But I have to admit, people have asked me more recently, and even though I have no idea how such a series of events would come to pass, I can tell that there isn't the bombast in my voice, in the denial, in the refusal. It's more like, 'Well, I dunno.' Never say never is I guess is what people tell you. In this life, all kinds of strange things come to pass. Realizing that it doesn't really kick up a big firestorm of emotion, it kind of suggests that at least if someone started talking I'd sit still long enough to listen.<ref name="heraldarticle">{{cite news|url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Fortunate/5082408/story.html |title=Fortunate son |newspaper=Calgary Herald |date=July 11, 2011 |access-date=July 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715020625/http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Fortunate/5082408/story.html |archive-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref>}}

When asked again in October 2011 about the prospect of a reunion, he said: "I'm saying it's possible, yeah. I think the call [laughs] would maybe have to come from outside the realm. Somebody would have to get me to look at things in a fresh way."<ref name="rollingstonearticle">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/john-fogerty-my-anger-towards-creedence-bandmates-has-faded-20111025?stop_mobi=yes|title=John Fogerty: My Anger Towards Creedence Bandmates Has Faded|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 25, 2011|access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> However, Cook and Clifford both stated in the February 2012 edition of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine that they are not interested in a CCR reunion. "Leopards don't change their spots. This is just an image-polishing exercise by John. My phone certainly hasn't rung", Cook said. Added Clifford: "It might have been a nice idea twenty years ago, but it's too late."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2012/01/03/creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion/ |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival Reunion: No Chance, Drummer and Bassist Say |publisher=Spinner |date=January 3, 2012 |access-date=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411204945/http://www.spinner.com/2012/01/03/creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion/ |archive-date=April 11, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, Fogerty once again said he would be open to a reunion, but he does not see Cook and Clifford being willing to change their stance. He told [[Charlie Rose]] on ''[[CBS This Morning]]'': "From time to time, I'll say something and it'll get in print that maybe that will happen, and then immediately I'll hear back stuff that doesn't sound like it's possible... I think it's a possibility in the future, you know. It's not something I'm actively seeking, but I'm not totally against the idea either."<ref name="CBS This Morning">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion-a-possibility/|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival reunion a possibility|publisher=John Fogerty: Creedence Clearwater Revival reunion a possibility|date=May 20, 2013|access-date=December 29, 2023}}</ref> In September 2017 Clifford again ruled out any chance of Cook and himself reuniting with John, restating, "It would have been great twenty, twenty-five years ago.

CCR's catalog of songs has frequently been used or referenced in popular culture, partly because John Fogerty signed away legal control of his old recordings to the band's record label, Fantasy Records.<ref name=aintme>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-11-01/entertainment/17570322_1_creedence-clearwater-revival-s-hits-wrangler-fantasy-records|title=Fogerty to Wrangler: Song in ad 'ain't me' – SFGate|publisher=Articles.sfgate.com|date=November 1, 2002|access-date=March 26, 2010|first=Bob|last=Baker}}</ref><ref name=lat02>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/219869391.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+23%2C+2002&author=Bob+Baker&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.2|title=Their 'Son' was Fogerty's baby; The last thing the singer wants is a Creedence corporate revival, but he doesn't own the rights, so 'Fortunate Son' now sells jeans|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 23, 2002|access-date=March 29, 2010|first=Bob|last=Baker|archive-date=February 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209014109/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/219869391.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+23%2C+2002&author=Bob+Baker&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.2|url-status=dead}}</ref> In an [[NPR]] interview, Fogerty objected to what he regarded as a misuse of his music:

{{blockquote|Folks will remember ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' and that was a great movie, but they don't remember all the really poor movies that Fantasy Records stuck Creedence music into: car commercials, tire commercials. I'm remembering a [[paint thinner]] ad at one point, the song "[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]." Oh, boy.

Of particular interest was the use of his protest song "Fortunate Son" in a [[blue jeans]] commercial.<ref name=aintme/> In this case, the advertiser eventually stopped using the song, as Fogerty related in a later interview:

{{blockquote|Yes, the people that owned Fantasy Records also owned all my early songs, and they would do all kinds of stuff I really hated in a commercial way with my songs. Then one day somebody from the ''[[Los Angeles Times|L.A. Times]]'' actually bothered to call me up and ask me how I felt, and I finally had a chance to talk about it. And I said I'm very much against my song being used to sell pants. So my position got stated very well in the newspaper, and lo and behold, [[Wrangler (jeans)|Wrangler]] to their credit said, "Wow, even though we made our agreement with the publisher, the owner of the song, we can see now that John Fogerty really hates the idea," so they stopped doing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/10/05/john-fogerty-experiences-a-musical-and-personal-revival/ |title=John Fogerty Experiences a Musical and Personal 'Revival' |publisher=Spinner |date=October 5, 2007 |access-date=March 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512091925/http://www.spinner.com/2007/10/05/john-fogerty-experiences-a-musical-and-personal-revival/ |archive-date=May 12, 2008}}</ref>}}

'''David Albert Alvin''' (born November 11, 1955) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer. He is a former and founding member of the [[roots rock]] band [[the Blasters]]. Alvin has recorded and performed as a solo artist since the late 1980s and has been involved in various side projects and collaborations. He has had brief stints as a member of the bands [[X (U.S. band)|X]] and [[the Knitters]]. He often refers to himself as "Blackjack Dave," in reference to his 1998 album and song of the same name.

== Early life ==
Alvin grew up in [[Downey, California]]. He and his older brother, [[Phil Alvin]], as teenagers frequented [[blues]], [[rockabilly]] and [[country music]] venues.<ref name="All Music bio">Deming, Mark.

== Career ==
=== With the Blasters ===
In 1979, Alvin and his brother Phil formed the roots-rock band [[The Blasters]] with fellow Downey residents [[Bill Bateman (drummer)|Bill Bateman]] and [[John Bazz]].<ref name="All Music bio" /><ref name="Blasters bio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-blasters-mn0000757177/biography | title=Artist Biography: The Blasters | publisher=AllMusic.com | author=Sullivan, Denise | author-link=Denise Sullivan }}</ref> Alvin served as the group's lead guitarist and chief songwriter.<ref name="Blasters bio" /> ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' noted the ever-increasing numbers of originals that Alvin wrote for the Blasters, along with his maturation into a great songwriter.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Rough Guide to Rock | publisher=Rough Guides | editor1=Buckley, Peter|editor2=Buckley, Jonathan| year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 106] | isbn=978-1-85828-457-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 }}</ref>

Other artists have covered Alvin's songs. For example, "[[Marie Marie]]" became a British-German top 20 hit in 1980 for [[Shakin' Stevens]] and received a [[zydeco]] treatment in 1987 from [[Buckwheat Zydeco]]. [[Dwight Yoakam]] recorded "Long White Cadillac" in 1989.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin was in the original lineup until 1986. His departure reflected internal tension in the band, but ultimately he wanted to sing his own songs while his brother [[Phil Alvin]] was the established lead vocalist for the group.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article36306066.html |author=Sculley, Alan |title=Alvin brothers: Losing no more time playing apart |work=Sacramento Bee |date=September 23, 2015 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

Alvin has rejoined the Blasters for some reunion tours and live albums with the original lineup. He has also occasionally performed with the band under other circumstances as well.<ref name="rosen">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/entertainment/tn-blr-1216-the-blasters-frontman-phil-alvin-takes-to-the-stage-new-years-eve-after-a-scary-2012-story.html |author=Rosen, Craig |title=The Blasters' frontman Phil Alvin takes to the stage New Year's Eve after a scary 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 15, 2012 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== With X and the Knitters ===
Alvin served a brief stint as the lead guitarist of the Los Angeles–based [[alternative rock]] band [[X (American band)|X]]. He left X in 1987 to work on a solo project after the group recorded their album ''[[See How We Are]]''.

Alvin was also a member of the [[country folk]] band [[The Knitters]], an offshoot of X. He appeared on their 1985 album  ''Poor Little Critter on the Road'' and their 2005 follow-up, ''The Modern Sounds of the Knitters''.<ref name="All Music bio" />

=== With the Flesh Eaters ===
In the early 1980s, Alvin, along with fellow Blasters members Bill Bateman and [[Steve Berlin]], performed on ''[[A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (album)|A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die]]'' by the Los Angeles [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[the Flesh Eaters]]. This lineup, which also included [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] and [[D.J. Bonebrake]], assembled once again in 2006, performing three shows in California and one in England to mark the album's 25th anniversary. They reunited briefly in 2015 for a five-show tour and again for an eight-show run in 2018. They issued a new album, ''[[I Used to Be Pretty]]'', in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://americanahighways.org/2019/03/19/show-review-flesh-eaters-rock-dcs-union-stage-with-porcupine/ |author=Cook, Glenn. |title=Show Review: Flesh Eaters Rock DC's Union Stage With Porcupine |work=Americana Highways |date=March 19, 2019 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>

=== Solo ===
[[File:Dave Alvin.jpg|thumb|Alvin in 2007]]
Alvin's first solo album, ''Romeo's Escape'' (entitled ''Every Night About This Time'' in England), was released in 1987. It was well received by critics but did not sell well. Because of the album's low sales, Alvin's recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] was terminated. He then toured with [[Mojo Nixon]] and [[Beat Farmers|Country Dick Montana]], billed as the Pleasure Barons; an album recorded live on their 1993 tour was released.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin's second solo album, ''Blue Blvd'', was released by [[Hightone Records]] in 1991. It received positive reviews and had moderate sales. His album ''Museum of Heart'' was released in 1993. He recorded ''[[King of California (album)|King of California]]'', an album of [[acoustic music]], in 1994. In 2000, he recorded the album ''[[Public Domain (album)|Public Domain: Songs From the Wild Land]]'', a collection of traditional folk and blues classics, which earned him a [[Grammy]] award for Best Contemporary [[Folk music|Folk]] Album.<ref name="All Music bio" />

In 2011, Alvin recorded the album ''[[Eleven Eleven (Dave Alvin album)|Eleven Eleven]]'', released by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The album marked his return to rock roots.<ref name="rs">{{cite magazine|last=Scherman|first=Tony|title=Dave Alvin: Eleven Eleven|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 21, 2011|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/eleven-eleven-20110621}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in a review of the album, called Alvin "an underrecognized guitar hero".<ref name="rs" />

=== Further recordings with Phil Alvin ===
In 2014, Dave and Phil Alvin, as a duo, released the album ''Common Ground'', consisting of their versions of songs by [[Big Bill Broonzy]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5908507/the-blasters-dave-phil-alvin-talk-common-ground-album-premiere-all-by-myself-song-listen-exclusive | title=Dave Alvin & Phil Alvin Talk 'Common Ground' Album, Premiere 'All By Myself' Song: Listen Exclusively | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=February 19, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Gallo, Phil}}</ref> It was the first studio collaboration of the brothers since the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-torn-up-band-of-brothers-finally-on-the-mend-1401411544 | title=A Torn-Up Band of Brothers, Finally on the Mend | work=[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] | date=May 29, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Dougherty, Steve}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-alvin-brothers-20140608-story.html#page=1 | title=Dave and Phil Alvin, Former Blasters Mates, Resurrect Partnership | work=Los Angeles Times | date=June 6, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Lewis, Randy}}</ref> In 2015 they released ''Lost Time'', a collection of covers including four songs by [[Big Joe Turner]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dave Alvin: Return of the Battlin' Brothers|page=24|date=March 2016|newspaper=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|last=Cohen|first=Elliot Stephen}}</ref>

In live performance, Alvin assumed the role of emcee and storyteller. The brothers also worked Blasters tunes into the set list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elmoremagazine.com/2016/09/reviews/shows/dave-and-phil-alvin-and-the-guilty-ones |title=Dave and Phil Alvin and the Guilty Ones |work=Elmore Magazine |date=September 9, 2016 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== With Jimmie Dale Gilmore ===
Alvin and Texas singer-songwriter [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] teamed on the 2018 album ''Downey to Lubbock'' (the title is a reference to where each man grew up).

As seen in his live performances with brother Phil, Alvin's stories between songs were a notable part of the stage shows with Gilmore and their supporting musicians.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://glidemagazine.com/214083/dave-alvin-and-jimmie-dale-gilmore-prove-perfect-collaborators-in-portland-show-review-photos/ |author=Ferguson, Neil |title=Dave Alvin and Jimmie Dale Gilmore Prove Perfect Collaborators in Portland |work=Glide Magazine |date=October 1, 2018 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

In April 2022, Alvin announced his return to public performance after a grueling two-year battle with different forms of cancer that started in May 2020. He chose to do so with Gilmore, scheduling nine dates in California for late June and early July 2022.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/dave-alvin-cancer-interview-1336284/ |author=Bernstein, Jonathan |title='I Should Have Died': Dave Alvin, Seminal California Country-Punk Guitarist, Talks Private Cancer Battle |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2022 |access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>

==Early life==
Barber was born on October 14, 1983, in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada<ref name=newcanadianmusicbio/> to Boyd Barber and Jean Doucha.  Growing up in the [[St. Norbert, Winnipeg|St. Norbert]] neighbourhood of Winnipeg,<ref name=bioand2015junos/> he took up the guitar.  By the time he was sixteen, he was writing music and performing in different bands.<ref name=bioand2015junos/>  One summer, after working to save up money, he recorded the songs he had written.<ref name=bioand2015junos/>  This was first glimpse of Del writing and producing his own music.

===''The Puck Drops Here'' and ''Easy Keeper'' (2016-2019)===
With ''Prairieography'' being dubbed as what could have been a career-making opus, Barber moved from Winnipeg to a farm in rural Manitoba to begin work on a follow-up album.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

On April 15, 2016; Barber along with the No Regretzkys released ''The Puck Drops Here'' through True North Records.<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/del_barber_and_the_no_regretzkys_lace_up_for_hockey-themed_lp_shoot_out_new_single|title=Del Barber & the No Regretzkys Lace Up for Hockey-themed LP, Shoot Out New Single|last=Murphy|first=Sarah|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>  With Barber being a hockey fan, this was a hockey themed album with distinct rock and country sounds.  Barber was in contact with True North sending them demos of songs he had been working on, but received no feedback.  Those songs would later be put on the album that would become ''Easy Keeper''. After not getting any feedback on those demos, Barber had the idea for a hockey themed album as it was never done before.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

It features covers of well-known songs such as [[Stompin' Tom Connors]]'s "[[The Hockey Song]]," ''Coach's Corner'' segment of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' theme "Flame of Victory," and [[Tom Cochrane]]'s "[[Big League (song)|Big League]]."  It also features covers of lesser known songs such as [[The Hanson Brothers]]' "Hockey Night Tonight" and [[The Pursuit of Happiness (band)|Pursuit of Happiness]]' "Gretzky Rocks."  Barber added some originals including "Hudson Bay Rules" and the single off the album "The Lights Go Out."<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere/>  The album was produced by [[Corb Lund]] guitarist Grant Siemens.<ref name=exclaimpuckdropshere/>

Barber's refusal to promote the album led to tensions between himself and the label.  He was subsequently dropped by True North and his agent as a result.<ref name=easykeeperrs/>

On June 10, 2018; Barber started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to raise money for his next album entitled ''Easy Keeper.''.<ref name=easykeeperkickstarter>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/248696342/easy-keeper-del-barbers-new-album/|title="Easy Keeper" - Del Barber's New Album!|date=June 10, 2018|work=Del Barber|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>  He stated that he took a hiatus and was now wanting to produce a new album.

<blockquote>"I wrote it before my dad passed—before he was even sick, but it became an anthem for me in the months after his passing.

He recorded the album at No Fun Club in Winnipeg.  It took one week to record the album with Grant Siemens and Scott Franchuk.<ref name=thecountrynote/>

<blockquote>"It was a really beautiful session.  There were no grand intentions, just an aim to get good players and friends together and record a pile of my songs.

I had a group of great songs and I really didn't want to stand in their way."<ref name=thecountrynote/></blockquote>

'''Delta Rae''' ({{IPAc-en|r|eɪ}} {{respell|RAY}}) is an American [[folk rock]] band formed in [[Durham, North Carolina]].<ref>Williams, Erin (January 23, 2012). "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/click-track/post/delta-rae-on-witch-trials-and-keeping-music-in-the-family/2012/01/18/gIQAdViOLQ_blog.html Delta Rae on witch trials and keeping music in the family]", ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Retrieved April 14, 2012.</ref> The band consists of three siblings Ian Hölljes (vocals and guitar), Eric Hölljes (vocals, guitar, piano and keys) and [[Brittany Hölljes]] (vocals), as well as Elizabeth Hopkins (vocals), Mike McKee (percussion) and Grant Emerson (bass guitar). The band feels that they do not fit into a single musical genre, but have described their sound as "gospel-tinged country-rock, sensual blue-eyed soul and harmony-laden Americana."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/07/03/meet-delta-rae-indie-band-unexpectedly-launched-fame-by-taylor-swift-scooter-braun-feud/|title=Meet Delta Rae, the indie band unexpectedly launched to fame by the Taylor Swift-Scooter Braun feud|last=Yahr|first=Emily|date=July 3, 2019|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Hölljes siblings ===
Three of the members of Delta Rae are siblings and members of the Hölljes family.  They grew up in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] where their parents instilled in them a love of music, reading, and education.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Delta Rae: An education in harmony|url=https://lancasteronline.com/entertainment/delta-rae-an-education-in-harmony/article_c06dd8dd-4d10-5ffe-8e6c-867db510b5e4.html|author=Jon Ferguson|website=LancasterOnline.com|date=12 July 2012 |language=en|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>

Ian and Eric Hölljes began writing music together when they were just 12 and 10-years-old, respectively.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Blair |first=Elizabeth |date=3 October 2012 |title=Delta Rae: Modern Folklore Music |url=https://www.wbur.org/npr/161696636/delta-rae-modern-folklore-music |access-date=2020-05-14 |website=Wbur.org |language=en}}</ref> The two of them write most of the songs for Delta Rae's music today.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Americana band Delta Rae have 4 vocalists and an enormous sound|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/25/8489807/delta-rae-interview|last=McKinney|first=Kelsey|date=2015-04-25|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref>

The siblings grew up hearing stories of folklore, mythology, and mysticism from their mother, a [[Montessori school]] teacher.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Interview: Delta Rae's Ian Hölljes on the Band's Witchy Ways & New Album 'The Light'|url=https://atwoodmagazine.com/drtl-delta-rae-2020-interview-the-light-album/|date=2020-02-19|website=Atwood Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref> She would read [[Greek mythology]] to them and often make up melodies and music to accompany the stories.<ref name=":0" /> In fact, the band's name hails from a fictional story the Hölljes' mother wrote about a Southern girl named Delta Rae who summons the Greek gods to earth.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fichera |first=Dawn Marie |title=antiMusic.com: Delta Rae Interview |url=https://www.antimusic.com/reviews/12/Delta_Rae_Interview.shtml |access-date=2022-12-31 |website=antiMusic}}</ref> Their mother is currently writing a book about this southern heroine.<ref name=":1" />

The three Hölljes siblings joined a teen [[a cappella]] group as middle schoolers in [[San Rafael, California]] called 'Til Dawn where they learned both how to write musical arrangements and how to sing as a group.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.waltermagazine.com/art-and-culture/delta-rising/|website=Waltermagazine.com|access-date=2020-05-14|title=Delta rising|date=30 September 2013}}</ref> In this a cappella group, they also met and became friends with their future Delta Rae bandmate, Elizabeth Hopkins.<ref name=":0" />

After the Eagles disbanded in 1980, Henley pursued a solo career and released his debut studio album ''[[I Can't Stand Still]]'', in 1982.

==Early life==
Born in [[Gilmer, Texas]], Henley grew up in the small northeast Texas town of [[Linden, Texas|Linden]].<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0377118|name=Don Henley}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.donhenleyonline.com/biography.htm |title=Don Henley Biography |website=Donhenleyonline.com |access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref> He is the son of Hughlene (née McWhorter; 1916–2003) and C.

Henley attended [[Linden-Kildare High School]], where he initially played [[High school football|football]]; due to his relatively small build, his coach suggested that he quit, and he joined the high school band instead. He first played the trombone, then moved to the percussion section.<ref name="biography">{{cite web |url=http://www.donhenleyonline.com/biography.htm |title=Don Henley Biography |work=Don Henley Online}}</ref>

After graduating from high school in 1965, Henley attended [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], then [[University of North Texas|North Texas State University]]<!--(renamed in 1988 the University of North Texas)--> in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] from 1967 to 1969.

==Career beginnings==
While still at high school, Henley was asked to join a [[Dixieland]] band formed by his childhood friend [[Richard Bowden]]'s father Elmer, together with another school friend Jerry Surratt. They then formed a band called the Four Speeds.<ref name="biography" /><ref>{{cite book |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |pages=13–14 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-306-81398-6}}</ref> In 1964 the band was renamed Felicity and went through a number of changes in band personnel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GGTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1591 |title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound |editor-first=Frank |editor-last=Hoffmann |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-135-94949-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shiloh – Shiloh (1969 us, amazing country folk rock with "the Eagles" Don Henley, 2014 korean remaster) |url=http://rockasteria.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/shiloh-shiloh-1969-us-amazing-country.html |work=RockAsteria|date=July 27, 2014 }}</ref> As Felicity they were signed to a local producer and released a Henley-penned song called "Hurtin'".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |page=14 |isbn=978-0-306-81398-6}}</ref> In 1969, they met by chance fellow Texan [[Kenny Rogers]] who took an interest in their band. They changed their name to Shiloh and recorded a few songs for Rogers, and "Jennifer (O' My Lady)" was released as their first single.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC&pg=PA20 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |page=20 |access-date=January 21, 2016 |isbn=978-0-306-81398-6 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 

Surratt died in a dirt bike accident just before their single was released. The band members then became Henley, Richard Bowden and his cousin Michael Bowden, [[Al Perkins]], and [[Jim Ed Norman]]. Rogers helped sign the band to [[Amos Records]], and brought the band to Los Angeles in June 1970. They recorded a self-titled album produced by Rogers at Larrabee Studios while living at the home of Rogers for a few months.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/ |title=History of the Eagles |year=2013 |time=20:55–21:30}}</ref> Shiloh disbanded in 1971 over the band's leadership and creative differences between Henley and Bowden.<ref>{{cite book |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |page=55 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-306-81398-6}}</ref>

In Los Angeles, Henley met [[Glenn Frey]] as they were both signed to the same label (Frey was signed to Amos Records, together with [[JD Souther]], as the duo [[Longbranch Pennywhistle]]), and they were recruited by [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] to be members of [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backup band for her tour in 1971. Touring with her was the catalyst for forming a group, as Henley and Frey decided to form their own band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |pages=61–62 |isbn=978-0-306-81398-6 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> They were joined by [[Randy Meisner]] and [[Bernie Leadon]] who also played in Ronstadt's backing band (the four had, however, played together only once previously, as the band personnel changed) and became the Eagles.<ref name="Fricke">{{cite magazine|first=David|last=Fricke|title=Life in the Slow Lane|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 22, 2000|id={{ProQuest|1192209}}}}</ref>

The band broke up in 1980, following a difficult tour and personal tensions that arose during the recording of ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]''. Eagles reunited 14 years later in 1994. Henley continues to tour and record with the Eagles. Their most recent album, ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', was released in 2007.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1241167|label=''Long Road Out of Eden''|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> The band had a number of highly successful tours, such as the Hell Freezes Over Tour (1994–1996), and [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]].

On his songwriting in the band, Henley stated in a March 2001 interview on ''[[Charlie Rose (show)|Charlie Rose]]'' that "rock bands work best as a benevolent dictatorship", with the principal songwriters in a band (in the case of Eagles, "me and Glenn Frey") being the ones that will likely hold the power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/article/don-henley-talks-about-the-eagles-latest-album-changes-in-the-industry-and-/ |title=Don Henley talks about Eagles' latest album, changes in the industry and more |work=PopMatters}}</ref>

==Solo career==
Following the breakup of the Eagles, Henley embarked on a solo career. He and [[Stevie Nicks]] (his girlfriend at the time) had duetted on her Top 10 Pop and Adult Contemporary hit "[[Leather and Lace (song)|Leather and Lace]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3172 |title=Leather And Lace by Stevie Nicks and Don Henley |publisher=Songfacts}}</ref> written by Nicks for [[Waylon Jennings]] and his wife [[Jessi Colter]], in late 1982. Henley's first solo album, ''[[I Can't Stand Still]]'', was a moderate seller. The single "[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]" reached No. 3 on the [[Billboard's Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at the beginning of 1983 and earned a Gold-certified single for sales of over a million copies in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-cant-stand-still-mw0000190305/awards |title=I Can't Stand Still – Don Henley – Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> It was Henley's all-time biggest solo hit single, and also was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

In live shows, Henley plays drums and sings simultaneously on some Eagles songs.<ref name="MusicRadar" /> On his solo songs and other Eagles songs, he plays electric guitar and simultaneously sings or just sings solo. Occasionally Eagles songs would get drastic rearrangements, such as "Hotel California" with four trombones.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAojSAb3vto | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822123128/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAojSAb3vto| archive-date=August 22, 2013|title=Hotel California |work=Don Henley – Live: Inside Job |date= November 21, 2000 |via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tot |first=Greg |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/2000/06/19/earnest-don-henley-gets-serious/ |title=Earnest Don Henley Gets Serious |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=June 19, 2000 |access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref>

==Lawsuits with Geffen Records==
Henley spent many years in legal entanglements with [[Geffen Records]]. In January 1993, following prolonged tensions between Henley and the label, the dispute went public and the record company filed a $30 million breach-of-contract suit in California Superior Court after receiving a notice from Henley saying that he was terminating his contract even though he reportedly owed the company two more studio albums and a greatest-hits collection.<ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite web |last=Philips |first=Chuck |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-09-01-ca-30272-story.html |title=Henley Ups the Ante in Geffen Fight : Lawsuit: Singer charges that entertainment impresario conspired with record corporations to blackball him. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 1, 1993}}</ref> Henley wanted to sign a publishing deal with [[EMI]] that would have been worth a few million dollars. Geffen Records stopped this from happening, which in turn upset Henley.<ref name="Los Angeles Times" />

Geffen Records claimed that Henley was in breach of contract and Henley attempted to get out of his contract in 1993 based on a 50-year-old California statute. Under the statute, enacted to free actors from long-term studio deals, entertainers cannot be forced to work for any company for more than seven years. Geffen Records did not want Henley signing with any other label, and had an agreement with [[Sony]] and EMI that they would not sign Henley. He counter-sued Geffen Records, claiming that he was "[[Blackballing|blackballed]]" by [[David Geffen]], who had made agreements with other record labels to not sign him.<ref name="Los Angeles Times" /> 

Henley eventually became an outspoken advocate for musicians' rights, taking a stand against music labels who he believes refuse to pay bands their due royalties. Henley came to terms with Geffen Records when the Eagles' reunion took off and the company eventually took a large chunk of the profit from the reunion album. Glenn Frey was also in legal entanglements with his label, [[MCA Records]] (whose parent company had also acquired Geffen).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2003/05/22/mca-is-history-long-lived-record-label-to-be-merged-into-geffen/ |title=MCA Is History – Long-Lived Record Label to be Merged into Geffen |work=New York Post|date=May 22, 2003 }}</ref> Before the Eagles reunion tour could begin, the band had to file a suit against [[Elektra Records]], which had planned to release a new Eagles ''Greatest Hits'' album.

A long period without a new recording followed as Henley waited out a dispute with his record company while also participating in a 1994 Eagles reunion tour and live album. During the hiatus, Henley recorded a cover of "[[Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat]]" for the film ''[[Leap of Faith (film)|Leap of Faith]]'', and provided the background vocals for country star [[Trisha Yearwood]]'s hit single "[[Walkaway Joe]]",{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} and duetted with [[Patty Smyth]] on "[[Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=23623|title=Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough by Patty Smyth and Don Henley|publisher=Songfacts}}</ref> and [[Roger Waters]] on "Watching TV" on Waters' ''[[Amused to Death]]'' album, in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elusivedisc.com/ROGER-WATERS-AMUSED-TO-DEATH-SACD/productinfo/APSA468761/|title=Roger Waters Amused To Death SACD|publisher=Elusivedisc.com|access-date=November 2, 2015|archive-date=September 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930050410/http://www.elusivedisc.com/Roger-Waters-Amused-to-Death-SACD/productinfo/APSA468761/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Henley provided the voice of Henry Faust in ''[[Randy Newman's Faust]]'', a 1993 musical which was released on compact disc that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donhenleyonline.com/solo/soundtracks/newmanfaust.htm|title=Randy Newman's Faust (1993)|publisher=Donhenleyonline.com|access-date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>

Henley and [[Courtney Love]] testified at a California Senate hearing on that state's contractual laws in Sacramento on September 5, 2001. In 2002 Henley became the head of the Recording Artists' Coalition. The coalition's primary aim was to raise money to mount a legal and political battle against the major record labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/News/en-us/don-henley-0424-2011.aspx|title=Don Henley Honored by Recording Artists Coalition|publisher=Gibson|access-date=August 4, 2014|archive-date=February 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201031142/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/News/en-us/don-henley-0424-2011.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> Henley says the group seeks to change the fundamental rules that govern most recording contracts, including copyright ownership, long-term control of intellectual property and unfair accounting practices.

In a 2007 interview with [[CNN]], while discussing the future of the Eagles, Henley indicated he still has plans for more records: "But we all have some solo plans still. I still have a contract with a major label [Warner] for a couple of solo albums."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/16/don.henley/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=Don Henley: 'Let the chips fall where they may' |date=November 19, 2007 |access-date=April 19, 2009 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> In January 2011, Henley commenced work on a solo album of country covers featuring special guests.

Henley was honored with the "Lifetime Achievement" award during the East Texas Music Awards event in 2015.

==Political and other causes==
In 1990, Henley founded the [[Walden Woods Project]] to help protect "[[Walden Pond|Walden Woods]]" from development. The Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods was started in 1998 to provide for research and education regarding [[Henry David Thoreau]]. In 1993, a compilation album titled ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'' was released, with a portion of the royalties from the sales going to the Walden Woods Project. In 2005, he had a fundraiser concert with [[Elton John]] and others to buy Brister's Hill,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walden.org/Explore/Walden_Woods_Ecosystem/Brister's_Hill |title=Brister's Hill &#124; Walden Woods |publisher=Walden.org |access-date=June 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926185024/http://www.walden.org/Explore/Walden_Woods_Ecosystem/Brister's_Hill |archive-date=September 26, 2010}}</ref> part of Walden Woods, and turn it into a hiking trail.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.walden.org/property/bristers-hill/|title=Brister's Hill|date=March 1, 2016|website=The Walden Woods Project}}</ref>

Henley co-founded the non-profit [[Caddo Lake]] Institute (CLI) in 1993 with Dwight K. Shellman to underwrite ecological education and research. As part of the Caddo Lake Coalition, CLI helps protect the Texas [[wetland]] where Henley spent much of his childhood. As a result of the Caddo Lake Institute's success in restoring and protecting Caddo Lake's wetlands, Caddo Lake was included as the 13th site in the United States on the [[Ramsar Convention]]'s list of significant wetlands. The Ramsar Convention is an intergovernmental treaty that provides a framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources.<ref name="auto"/>

In 2000, Henley co-founded the [[Recording Artists' Coalition]], a group founded to protect musicians' rights against common music industry business practices. In this role he testified before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442372/alanis-testify-at-us-senate-hearing.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=March 31, 2001|access-date=February 8, 2008|title=Alanis To Testify At U.S. Senate Hearing}}{{dead link|date=June 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azoz.com/newsarchive/2003/01/0019d.html |title=Testimony Of Don Henley |publisher=Azoz.com |date=January 30, 2003 |access-date=July 29, 2011}}</ref>

A lifelong supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Henley has also been a generous donor to political campaigns of Democrats. In 2008, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported Henley had donated over $680,000 to political candidates since 1978.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hesse |first=Monica |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 3, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/02/01/ST2008020102197.html |title=Stars Who Don't Have Money on This Race |access-date=February 3, 2008}}</ref> Several tracks on the 2007 Eagles album ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'' (including the title track, which Henley co-wrote) are sharply critical of the [[Iraq War]] and other policies of the Bush administration.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gunderson|first=Edna|title=The Eagles raise their voices in harmony after 28 years|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-10-29-eagles-main_N.htm|access-date=January 21, 2016|work=USA Today|date=October 30, 2007}}</ref>

Henley's liberal political leanings led to tension with guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]] when he submitted the song "I Wish You Peace" for inclusion on ''[[One of These Nights]]''. Henley was not thrilled that the song was co-written by [[Patti Davis]], who was the daughter of [[Ronald Reagan]], the Republican governor of California at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://outsider.com/news/entertainment/eagles-major-disagreement-cutting-song-co-written-ronald-reagans-daughter/ |title=Why the Eagles Got Into a Major Disagreement About Cutting a Song Co-Written by Ronald Reagan's Daughter |last=Morgan |first=Emily |publisher=Outsider.com |date=February 16, 2021}}</ref>

Henley remarked "On that bitter cold Tuesday of February 16th, we had a busted pipe at the attic at my house, and me and my family were shoveling and bailing for 8 or 9 hours there.

=== Testifying to Congress over the state of DMCA ===
On June 2, 2020, Henley gave testimony to the United States Congress regarding his views on copyright law, specifically the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Senate Hearing on Copyright Law {{!}} C-SPAN.org |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?472616-1/senate-hearing-copyright-law |access-date=June 15, 2023 |website=www.c-span.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Blistein |first=Jon |date=June 3, 2020 |title=Eagles' Don Henley Calls on Congress to Bolster Online Copyright Laws |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eagles-don-henley-dmca-copyright-law-congress-testimony-1009497/ |access-date=June 15, 2023 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> Henley argued that the act is outdated, unfair to artists, and that it is not sufficiently enforced. These statements in turn sparked public backlash against him from parties believing that DMCA enforcement is already too harshly enforced and often abused. Opposition to Henley's views was particularly widespread among online content creators, many of whom had been subject to [[YouTube copyright strike]]s pertaining to the use of songs by Henley or the Eagles, regardless of the legitimacy of the claim in question.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 20, 2021 |title=Eagles' Don Henley asks Congress to change copyright law |url=https://apnews.com/article/technology-music-don-henley-ap-top-news-politics-23e26c38a9a6fbf3d7451c42b058c216 |access-date=June 15, 2023 |website=AP NEWS |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Why Do Certain Artists Still Block Their Music? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eofD6bZ0m4 |access-date=June 15, 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Citation |title=Don Henley Testifies To Congress Wanting Copyright Law To Be Stricter, Defends UMG Copyright Abuse! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2FCML9LG4 |access-date=June 15, 2023 |language=en}}</ref> 

Henley is known for actively taking down online content involving music for which he holds copyright, doing so even when the content in question is considered fair use. According to research conducted by music producer and teacher [[Rick Beato]], Henley has been responsible for manual takedowns of instructional videos teaching how to play Eagles songs despite such educational material falling under fair use protections.<ref name=":0" />

==Personal life==
In 1974, Henley became involved with Lorelei Shellist, and the breakup of their relationship was the inspiration for the song "[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Wasted Time]]" and parts of the lyrics for "[[Hotel California]]".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC |title=To The Limit: The Untold Story Of The Eagles |first=Marc |last=Eliot |pages=123–127, 148 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2004 |access-date=January 21, 2016 |isbn=978-0-306-81398-6 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/readers-poll-the-10-best-eagles-songs-70381/|title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Best Eagles Songs|first1=Andy|last1=Greene|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 29, 2015}}</ref> Late in 1975, Henley started dating [[Fleetwood Mac]] singer [[Stevie Nicks]] as her relationship with [[Lindsey Buckingham]] came to an end.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |work=The Telegraph |date=September 8, 2007 |access-date=October 22, 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The relationship lasted on and off for around two years, and Henley claimed that Nicks wrote her song "[[Sara (Fleetwood Mac song)|Sara]]" about their unborn child.

In February 2024, it was revealed that Henley had stalled plans for an Eagles biography that writer [[Ed Sanders]] planned to publish.

===1980 arrest===
Henley called paramedics to his home on November 21, 1980, and there they found a naked 16-year-old girl claiming she had overdosed on [[quaalude]]s and [[cocaine]]. She was arrested for [[prostitution in the United States|prostitution]], while a 15-year-old girl found in the house was arrested for being under the influence of drugs. Henley was also arrested and subsequently charged with contributing to the [[juvenile delinquency in the United States|delinquency of a minor]]. He pled [[nolo contendere|no contest]], was fined $2,500 and put on two years' [[probation]]. Lois Chiles, who was no longer in a relationship with Henley at the time of the incident, later said, "I was shocked to hear about it. He didn't have drugs around the house. It was an accident, I'm sure". The media attention from this incident was the primary inspiration for the song "[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]".<ref name="Fur" />

Henley said he and the girl had a few drinks and did some cocaine, and later she had what appeared to him to be an [[Epilepsy#Seizures|epileptic seizure]]. Henley called paramedics, but the girl had recovered by the time they arrived. Henley said it was only when the paramedics asked the girl questions that he learned she was underage. A while later, officers from the Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit arrived and placed Henley and the girl under arrest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Don Henley, lead singer of the Eagles rock group,... - UPI Archives |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1980/11/25/Don-Henley-lead-singer-of-the-Eagles-rock-group/3683309087449/ |website=UPI |access-date=23 February 2024 |language=en}}</ref> During the trial testimony, Henley described the incident leading to his arrest as "a poor decision which I regret to this day,” stating that he sought an "escape" due to the depression he developed after the Eagles' recent breakup.<ref>{{cite news |last=Peltz| first=Jennifer|title=Don Henley tells court he never gave away drafts of 'Hotel California' lyrics| url=https://apnews.com/article/henley-hotel-california-lyrics-trial-eagles-aa5300708de790099f9f7d0ba3b8afcf|website=AP News|accessdate=26 February 2024 | language=en |date=26 February 2024}}</ref>

The '''Eagles''' are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. With five number-one singles and six number-one albums, six [[Grammy Award]]s and five [[American Music Award]]s, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s in North America and are one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]], having sold more than 200{{nbsp}}million records worldwide,<ref name="Gold">{{cite web|title= Gold's Hall of Fame: Eagles |publisher= [[Gold (British radio network)|Gold]] |date= September 5, 2019 |access-date= September 3, 2020 |url= https://www.mygoldmusic.co.uk/hall-of-fame/eagles-band-members-songs-split-facts/}}</ref> including 100{{nbsp}}million sold in the US alone.<ref>{{cite news|title= Central Vermont Arts Preview |newspaper= [[Rutland Herald]] |date= September 28, 2019 |access-date= September 28, 2019 |url= https://www.rutlandherald.com/features/vermont_arts/central-vermont-arts-preview/article_fa6d4302-41f9-586d-afae-383b222dd772.html}}</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998 and were ranked number 75 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 2004 list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|title= 100 Greatest Artists – 75 > Eagles |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |issue= 946 |date= April 15, 2004 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/eagles-20111216 |access-date= October 27, 2007}}</ref> Founding members [[Glenn Frey]] (guitars, vocals), [[Don Henley]] (drums, vocals), [[Bernie Leadon]] (guitars, vocals), and [[Randy Meisner]] (bass guitar, vocals) were recruited by [[Linda Ronstadt]] as band members, some touring with her, and all playing on her [[Linda Ronstadt (album)|third solo studio album]], before venturing out on their own on [[David Geffen]]'s new [[Asylum Records]] label.

Their debut studio album, ''[[Eagles (album)|Eagles]]'' (1972), spawned two top-20 singles in the US and Canada: "[[Take It Easy]]" and "[[Witchy Woman]]". The next year's follow-up album, ''[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]'', peaked at only number 41 in the US, although [[Desperado (Eagles song)|the title song]] became a popular track. In 1974, guitarist [[Don Felder]] joined, and ''[[On the Border]]'' produced the top-40 hit "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]" and the Eagles' first number-one song in the US and Canada, "[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]", which made the top 15 in Australia, their first hit overseas. In 1975, the album ''[[One of These Nights]]'' became their first number-one album in the US and a top ten album in many countries. It included the US number-one hit "[[One of These Nights (Eagles song)|One of These Nights]]", which was their first top ten hit outside of North America, and US top-5 songs "[[Lyin' Eyes]]" and "[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]". Also in 1975, Leadon left the band and was replaced by guitarist and vocalist [[Joe Walsh]].

''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' (1976) is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling album in the United States]], with 38 million copies sold, and primed the public for the late 1976 release of ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'', which would sell more than 26{{nbsp}}million copies in the US (ranking third all-time for US sales), and more than 32{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles in the US and Canada, "[[New Kid in Town]]" and "[[Hotel California]]", the latter of which became their only top-10 hit in the United Kingdom, while also reaching the top ten in New Zealand and many European countries, including number two in France.

Meisner was replaced by [[Timothy B. Schmit]] in 1977. The Eagles released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]'', spawning the North American number-one song "[[Heartache Tonight]]", which became their biggest hit in Australia (number 13), and the North American top-10 hits "[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]" and "[[I Can't Tell You Why]]". The Eagles broke up in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'', a mix of live and new studio tracks, and toured consistently. In 2007, the Eagles released ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', their sixth number-one album in the US, and in 2008 launched the [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]]. In 2013, they began the extended [[History of the Eagles – Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]] in conjunction with the documentary release, ''[[History of the Eagles]]''. Following Frey's death in January 2016, the Eagles re-formed in 2017, with Glenn's son Deacon Frey and country singer [[Vince Gill]] sharing lead vocals for Frey's songs.<ref name="CMT">{{cite web|title= Deacon Frey and Vince Gill Join The Eagles for Classic West-East Festivals |publisher= [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] |date= June 1, 2017 |access-date= 15 March 2019 |url= http://www.cmt.com/news/1782118/deacon-frey-and-vince-gill-join-the-eagles-for-classic-west-east-festivals/ |archive-date= December 1, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201161126/http://www.cmt.com/news/1782118/deacon-frey-and-vince-gill-join-the-eagles-for-classic-west-east-festivals/}}</ref> Deacon Frey left the band in 2022,<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Chris |last= Willman |title= Deacon Frey Leaves the Eagles After Long Run Filling in for Father Glenn Frey |magazine= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date= April 6, 2022 |access-date= May 3, 2022 |url= https://variety.com/2022/music/news/deacon-frey-eagles-leaves-glenn-tour-1235226808/}}</ref> but returned in 2023 to participate in the band's ongoing final tour.

==History==
===1971–1973: formation and early releases===
The Eagles had their origin in early 1971, when [[Linda Ronstadt]] and her manager [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] recruited musicians [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Don Henley]] for her band.<ref name="Eagles">{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eagles-mn0000144847/biography |first= William |last= Ruhlmann |title= Eagles – Artist Biography |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= August 14, 2014}}</ref> Henley had moved to [[Los Angeles]] from [[Texas]] with his band Shiloh to record an album produced by [[Kenny Rogers]],{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=39}} and Frey had come from Michigan and formed [[Longbranch Pennywhistle]]; the two then met in 1970 at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in Los Angeles and became acquainted through their mutual record label, [[Amos Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.troubadour.com/history/ |title= History > 1970 |access-date= August 14, 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=81}} [[Randy Meisner]], who had been working with [[Ricky Nelson]]'s backing band, the Stone Canyon Band, and [[Bernie Leadon]], a veteran of [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], also later joined Ronstadt's group of performers for her summer tour promoting the ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]'' album.<ref name="Eagles"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Eagles |website= Hit Parade Hall of Fame |url= http://hitparadehalloffame.com/eagles/ |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225436/http://hitparadehalloffame.com/eagles/}}</ref>

While on the tour with Ronstadt, Frey and Henley decided to form a band together and informed Ronstadt of their intention. Frey later credited Ronstadt with suggesting Leadon for the band, and arranging for Leadon to play for her so Frey and Henley could approach him about forming a band together. They also pitched the idea to Meisner and brought him on board.<ref>{{cite web |first= Travis |last= Smiley |title= Glenn Frey Tribute – Part 2 |publisher= [[PBS]] |url= https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/glenn-frey-tribute-part-2/ |date= January 21, 2016 |access-date= March 3, 2016 |archive-date= March 1, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160301013644/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/glenn-frey-tribute-part-2/ |url-status= dead }}</ref> These four played live together behind Ronstadt only once for a July concert at [[Disneyland]],<ref name="Eagles"/> but all four appeared on her [[Linda Ronstadt (album)|self-titled album]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000628307/credits |title= Linda Ronstadt – Linda Ronstadt |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= November 28, 2010}}</ref> It was later proposed that [[JD Souther]] should join the band, but Meisner objected.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=68–70}} The four were signed in September 1971 to [[Asylum Records]], the new label started by [[David Geffen]], who was introduced to Frey by [[Jackson Browne]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=68–69}} Geffen bought out Frey's and Henley's contracts with Amos Records, and sent the four to [[Aspen, Colorado]], to develop as a band.<ref>{{cite book|first= George |last= Brown |title= Colorado Rocks!: A Half-century of Music in Colorado |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=10eRzwLWOEwC&pg=PT7 |publisher= Pruett Publishing Co |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-87108-930-4}}</ref> Having not settled on a band name yet, they performed their first show in October 1971 under the name of Teen King and the Emergencies at a club called The Gallery in Aspen.<ref>{{cite news|first= Scott |last= Condon |title= Frey had strong ties to Aspen 'partytown' |date= January 18, 2016 |newspaper= [[The Aspen Times]] |url= http://www.aspentimes.com/news/20221099-113/frey-had-strong-ties-to-aspen-partytown |access-date= March 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Rick |last= Roddam |title= The History of the Eagles...In Colorado |publisher= 101.9 King FM |date= January 19, 2016 |access-date= February 26, 2016 |url= http://kingfm.com/the-history-of-the-eagles-in-colorado/}}</ref>

The idea of naming the band "Eagles" came during a [[peyote]] and [[tequila]]-influenced group outing in the [[Mojave Desert]]. However, accounts of the origin of the name vary; Don Felder, who had yet to join the Eagles and was not at the desert, credited Leadon with originating the name when he recalled reading about the [[Hopi]]s' reverence for the eagle,{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=82}} while Souther suggested that the idea came when Frey shouted out, "Eagles!" when they saw eagles flying above.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= David |last= Browne |title= Glenn Frey: An Oral History |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/glenn-frey-an-oral-history-182045/ |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= January 28, 2016}}</ref> [[Steve Martin]], a friend of the band from their early days at The Troubadour, recounts in his autobiography that he suggested that they should be referred to as "the Eagles", but Frey insists that the group's name is simply "Eagles".{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=136}} Geffen and partner [[Elliot Roberts]] initially managed the band; they were later replaced by [[Irving Azoff]] while the Eagles were recording their third album.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=97–98, 101–105}}

The group's self-titled debut album was recorded in England in February 1972 with producer [[Glyn Johns]].<ref name="Eagles"/> Johns was impressed by the harmony singing of the band,<ref>{{cite AV media|title= History of the Eagles |year= 2013 |time= 34:50–36:55 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/}}</ref> and he has been credited with shaping the band into "the country-rock band with those high-flyin' harmonies".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Cameron |last= Crowe |url= http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs196-the-eagles/ |title= The Eagles: Chips off the old Buffalo |date= September 25, 1975 |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |publisher= The Uncool |access-date= March 8, 2016}}</ref> Released on June 1, 1972, ''[[Eagles (album)|Eagles]]'' was a breakthrough success, yielding three [[Top 40]] singles. The first single and lead track, "[[Take It Easy]]", was a song written by Frey with his neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker Jackson Browne. Browne had written the first verse of the song, but got stalled on the second verse after the line "I'm standing on a corner in [[Winslow, Arizona]]." Frey completed the verse, and Browne carried on to finish the song.<ref name="Crowe"/> The song reached number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was followed by the bluesy "[[Witchy Woman]]" and the soft country rock ballad "[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]", charting at number 9 and number 22 respectively.<ref name="singles">{{cite magazine|title= Eagles |magazine= Billboard |access-date= October 12, 2020 |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/eagles/chart-history/hsi/}}</ref> The group were one of the support acts for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their [[Close to the Edge Tour]].<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Watkinson |year= 2000 |title= Yes: Perpetual Change: Thirty Years of Yes |publisher= Plexus |location= London |page=[https://archive.org/details/yesperpetualchan00watk/page/108 108] |isbn= 0-85965-297-1}}</ref>

Their second album, ''[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]'', took [[American frontier|Old West]] outlaws for its theme, drawing comparisons between their lifestyles and modern rock stars. During these recording sessions, Henley and Frey began collaborating. They co-wrote eight of the album's eleven songs, including "[[Tequila Sunrise (Eagles song)|Tequila Sunrise]]" and "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]", two of the group's most popular songs.<ref>{{cite web|first= Travis |last= Smiley |title= Glenn Frey Tribute – Part 1 |publisher= [[PBS]] |date= January 20, 2016 |url= https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/glenn-frey-tribute-part-1/ |archive-date= February 27, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160227210128/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/glenn-frey-tribute-part-1/}}</ref> The album was less successful than the first, reaching only number 41 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and yielding two singles, "Tequila Sunrise", which reached number 61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and "Outlaw Man", which peaked at number 59.<ref name="singles"/> With Henley and Frey co-writing the bulk of the album, the album marked a significant change for the band.

===1973–1975: ''On the Border'' and ''One of These Nights'' ===
For their next album, ''[[On the Border]]'', Henley and Frey wanted the band to break away from the [[country rock]] style and move more towards [[hard rock]]. The Eagles initially started with [[Glyn Johns]] as the producer for this album, but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their double-edged music. After completing only two usable songs, the band turned to [[Bill Szymczyk]] to produce the rest of the album.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Richard |last= Buskin |title= The Eagles 'Hotel California' Classic Tracks |date= September 2010 |magazine= [[Sound on Sound]] |url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep10/articles/classic-tracks-0910.htm}}</ref>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=106}} Szymczyk wanted a harder-edged guitarist for the song "Good Day in Hell" and the band remembered [[Bernie Leadon]]'s childhood friend [[Don Felder]], a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] in Boston.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=83–85, 94–96}} Felder had been nicknamed "Fingers" at the jam by Frey, a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=83}} In January 1974, Frey called Felder to add [[slide guitar]] to the song "Good Day in Hell" and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=108, 112–113}} He appeared on one other song on the album, the up-tempo breakup song "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]", on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey. "Already Gone" was released as the first single from the album and it reached number 32 on the charts. ''On the Border'' yielded a number 1 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' single ("[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]"), which hit the top of the charts on March 1, 1975. The song was the Eagles' first of five chart-toppers.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=112–113}} The album included a cover version of the [[Tom Waits]] song "[[Ol' '55]]" and the single "[[James Dean (song)|James Dean]]", which reached number 77 on the charts.

The band played at the [[California Jam]] festival in [[Ontario, California]], on April 6, 1974. Attracting more than 300,000 fans and billed as "the Woodstock of the West Coast", the festival featured [[Black Sabbath]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Seals and Crofts|Seals & Crofts]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], and [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]].{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=125}} Portions of the show were telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in the United States, exposing the Eagles to a wider audience. Felder missed the show when he was called away to attend the birth of his son; Jackson Browne filled in for him on piano and acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=126–127}}

The Eagles released their fourth studio album, ''[[One of These Nights]]'', on June 10, 1975. A breakthrough album for the Eagles, making them international superstars, it was the first in a string of four consecutive number 1 albums. The dominant songwriting partnership of Henley and Frey continued on this album. The first single was the title track, which became their second consecutive chart-topper. Frey called it his all-time favorite Eagles tune.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title= [[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]] |year= 2003 |type= CD |publisher= Warner Music Group |id= R2 73971 |quote= We made a quantum leap with 'One Of These Nights.'

The final single, "[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]", was written by Meisner, Henley, and Frey, and it is the only Eagles single to feature Meisner on lead vocals. The song reached number 4 on the charts. The band launched a huge worldwide tour in support of the album, and the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The group was featured on the cover of the September 25, 1975 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and on September 28, the band joined [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[Toots and the Maytals]] for a show in front of 55,000 people at [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim Stadium]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=119}}

''One of These Nights'' was their last album to feature founding member Bernie Leadon.  Leadon wrote or co-wrote three songs for the album, including "I Wish You Peace", written with his girlfriend [[Patti Davis]] (daughter of [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Nancy Reagan]]); and the instrumental "[[Journey of the Sorcerer]]", which would later be used as the theme music for the [[BBC]]'s radio and television versions of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Leadon was disillusioned with the direction the band's music was taking and his loss of creative control as their sound was moving from his preferred country to rock and roll.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=132}} His dissatisfaction, principally with Frey, boiled over one night when Frey was talking animatedly about the direction they should take next, and Leadon poured a beer over Frey's head, and said, "You need to chill out, man!"<ref>{{cite AV media|title= History of the Eagles |year= 2013 |time= 1:14:00–1:16:00 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194326/}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first= Andy |last= Greene |title= Former Eagles Guitarist Bernie Leadon to Rejoin Band for Upcoming Tour |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/former-eagles-guitarist-bernie-leadon-to-rejoin-band-for-upcoming-tour-20130409 |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= April 9, 2013 |access-date= March 27, 2016}}</ref> In December 1975, after months of denials, it was announced that Leadon had left the band.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=132}}

===1975–1977: major success with ''Hotel California'' ===
[[File:Joe Walsh 4 - 1975.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Guitarist [[Joe Walsh]] joined the band in 1975, replacing Leadon.]]
Leadon's replacement was guitarist and singer [[Joe Walsh]], who had been a friend of the band for some years. He had previously performed with [[James Gang]], [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]], and as a solo artist; he was also managed by Azoff and used Szymczyk as his record producer.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=153}} There was some initial concern as to Walsh's ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered too "wild" for the Eagles, especially by Henley.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=153}} After the departure of Leadon, the Eagles' early country sound almost completely disappeared, with the band employing a harder sound with the addition of Felder and Walsh; however, Felder also had to play [[banjo]], [[pedal steel]], and [[mandolin]] on future tours, something that had previously been Leadon's domain.<ref>{{cite web|first= Nick |last= Deriso |title= Don Felder on the Eagles' 'Hotel California', 'Heavy Metal', other solo songs: Gimme Five |date= November 16, 2012 |access-date= June 10, 2016 |url= http://somethingelsereviews.com/2012/11/16/one-track-mind-don-felder-on-the-eagles-hotel-california-those-shoes-and-solo-songs/}}</ref>

The following album, ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'', released on December 8, 1976, was the band's fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process that, along with touring, drained the band. The album's first single, "[[New Kid in Town]]", became the Eagles' third number-one single.

The second single was the [[Hotel California|title track]], which topped the charts in May 1977 and became the Eagles' signature song. It features Henley on lead vocals, with a guitar duet performed by Felder and Walsh. The song was co-written by Felder, Henley, and Frey.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Don Felder Reveals the Roots of 'Hotel California' and Shows You How to Play It |magazine= [[Guitar World]] |date= December 27, 2016 |access-date= April 14, 2019 |url= https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/don-felder-tells-story-behind-eagles-hotel-california-and-shows-you-how-play-it}}</ref> The mysterious lyrics have been interpreted in many ways, some of them controversial. Rumors even started in certain quarters that the song was about Satanism. The rumor was dismissed by the band and later by Henley in the documentary film ''[[History of the Eagles]]''. Henley told ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in 2007 that "it's basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American Dream and about excess in America, which was something we knew about."<ref>{{cite web|first= Steve |last= Kroft |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3538308n |title= Eagles: Dark Days |date= November 25, 2007 |work= [[60 Minutes]] |publisher= [[CBS News]] |access-date= September 22, 2013}}</ref>

With its hard rock sound, "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]" was also a major success that established Walsh's position in the band. The third and final single from ''Hotel California'', it reached number 11 on the charts. The ballad "Wasted Time" closes the first side of the album, while an instrumental reprise of it opens the second side. The album concludes with "[[The Last Resort (Eagles song)|The Last Resort]]", a song that Frey once referred to as "Henley's opus", but which Henley described as "fairly pedestrian" and "never fully realized, musically speaking".<ref name="Crowe">{{cite web|first= Cameron |last= Crowe |url= http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/the-very-best-of-the-eagles/ |title= Eagles: Very Best Of – Conversations With Don Henley and Glenn Frey |date= August 2003 |work= Conversations with Glenn Frey and Don Henley |publisher= The Uncool |access-date= September 22, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Gramaphone record#Structure|run-out groove]] on side two has the words "V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live" etched into the vinyl, which means that the instrumental track for the song "Victim of Love" was recorded live in the studio, with no overdubs. Henley confirms this in the liner notes of ''[[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]].'' However, the song was a point of contention between [[Don Felder]] and the rest of the band. In the 2013 documentary, Felder claimed that he had been promised the lead vocal on "Victim of Love", for which he had written most of the music. After many unproductive attempts to record Felder's vocal, band manager [[Irving Azoff]] was delegated to take Felder out for a meal, removing him from the mix while Don Henley overdubbed his lead vocal.

The album won Grammys for "Record of the Year" ("Hotel California") and "Best Arrangement for Voices" ("New Kid in Town"). ''Hotel California'' topped the charts and was nominated for Album of the Year at the [[20th Annual Grammy Awards|1978 Grammy Awards]], but lost to [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]].'' The huge worldwide tour in support of the album further drained the band members and strained their personal and creative relationships.

''Hotel California'' is the last album to feature founding member Randy Meisner, who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. The Eagles had been touring continuously for eleven months; the band was suffering from the strain of the tour, and Meisner's [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]] had flared up by the time they arrived in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] in June 1977.<ref name="Greene">{{cite magazine|first= Andy |last= Greene |title= Flashback: The Eagles Play 'Take It to the Limit' in 1977 |magazine= Rolling Stone |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-the-eagles-play-take-it-to-the-limit-in-1977-20150716 |date= July 16, 2015 |access-date= March 8, 2016}}</ref> Meisner had been struggling to hit the crucial high notes in his signature song, "Take It to the Limit", and decided to not sing the song as an encore at the Knoxville concert because he had been up late and caught the [[Influenza|flu]].

His last performance was in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]], on September 3, 1977.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=188}} The band replaced Meisner with the same musician who had succeeded him in [[Poco (band)|Poco]], [[Timothy B.

In 1977, the group, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for [[Randy Newman]]'s album ''[[Little Criminals]]'', including "[[Short People]]", which has backup vocals by Frey and Schmit.

===1977–1980: ''The Long Run'', breakup===
The Eagles went into the recording studio in 1977 to begin work on their next album, ''[[The Long Run (Eagles album)|The Long Run]]''. The album took two years to complete. It was originally intended to be a double album, but the band members were unable to write enough songs. ''The Long Run'' was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some critics for failing to live up to ''Hotel California'', it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold seven million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles. "[[Heartache Tonight]]" became their last single to top the Hot 100, on November 10, 1979. The [[The Long Run (song)|title track]] and "[[I Can't Tell You Why]]" both reached number 8. The band won their fourth Grammy for "Heartache Tonight". "[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]]" by Walsh and "The Sad Cafe" became live staples. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, "Funky New Year" and "[[Please Come Home for Christmas]]", which was released as a single in 1978 and reached number 18 on the charts.

Frey, Henley, and Schmit contributed backup vocals for the single release of "[[Look What You've Done to Me]]" by [[Boz Scaggs]]. A different version with female backing vocals appears on the ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' soundtrack, along with the Eagles' 1975 hit "Lyin' Eyes".

On July 31, 1980, in [[Long Beach, California]], tempers boiled over into what has been described as the "Long Night at Wrong Beach".<ref name="Times">{{cite news|title= How The Eagles took it to the limits |newspaper= [[The Times]] |location= London |date= October 12, 2007 |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2638985.ece |archive-date= July 18, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080718172259/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2638985.ece}}</ref>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=209}} The animosity between Felder and Frey boiled over before the show began, when Felder said, "You're welcome – I guess" to California Senator [[Alan Cranston]]'s wife as the politician was thanking the band backstage for performing a benefit for his re-election.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=209–210}} Frey and Felder spent the entire show telling each other about the beating each planned to administer backstage.

It appeared to be the end of the Eagles, but the band still had a commitment with [[Elektra Records]] to make a live record from the tour. ''[[Eagles Live]]'' (released in November 1980) was mixed on opposite coasts. Frey had already left the band and would remain in Los Angeles, while the other band members each worked on their parts in [[Miami]].{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=214}} "We were fixing three-part harmonies courtesy of Federal Express," said producer [[Bill Szymczyk]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=39}} Frey refused to speak to the other Eagles, and he fired Irving Azoff as his manager.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=214}} With credits that listed five attorneys, the album's liner notes simply said, "Thank you and goodnight." A single released from the album – "[[Seven Bridges Road]]" – had been a live concert staple for the band. It was written by [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]] in an arrangement created by [[Iain Matthews]] for his ''Valley Hi'' album in 1973. The song reached number 21 on the charts in 1980, becoming the Eagles' last Top 40 single until 1994.

===1980–1994: hiatus===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}
After the Eagles broke up, the former members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band's long-time record label, initially owned the rights to solo albums created by members of the Eagles. Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, but it was uncharted waters for the others.

Walsh released a successful album in 1981, ''[[There Goes the Neighborhood (album)|There Goes the Neighborhood]],'' but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s were less well received. During this period, Walsh performed as a session musician for [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[John Entwistle]], [[Richard Marx]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], among others, and produced and co-wrote [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Old Wave]]'' album.

Henley achieved commercial solo success. In 1981, he sang a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] ([[Fleetwood Mac]]), "[[Leather and Lace (song)|Leather and Lace]]". In 1982, he released ''[[I Can't Stand Still]],'' featuring the hit "[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]". The next album, ''[[Building the Perfect Beast]]'' (1984), featured "[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys of Summer]]" (a ''Billboard'' number 5 hit), "[[All She Wants to Do Is Dance]]" (number 9), "Not Enough Love in the World" (number 34) and "[[Sunset Grill (song)|Sunset Grill]]" (number 22). Henley's next album, ''[[The End of the Innocence (album)|The End of the Innocence]]'' (1989), was also a major success. It included "[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]", "[[The Last Worthless Evening]]" and "[[The Heart of the Matter (song)|The Heart of the Matter]]". His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company, which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994.

Frey achieved solo success in the 1980s. In 1982, he released his first album, ''[[No Fun Aloud]]'', which spawned the number 15 hit "[[The One You Love (Glenn Frey song)|The One You Love]]". ''[[The Allnighter (album)|The Allnighter]]'' (1984) featured the number 20 hit "Sexy Girl". He reached number 2 on the charts with "[[The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)|The Heat Is On]]" from the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' soundtrack. He had another number 2 single in 1985 with "[[You Belong to the City]]" from the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' soundtrack, which featured another Frey song, "[[Smuggler's Blues]]". He appeared as "Jimmy" in the episode titled after the song and contributed riffs to the episode's soundtrack. He also contributed the songs "Flip City" to the ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' soundtrack and "Part of Me, Part of You" to the soundtrack for ''[[Thelma & Louise]].''

Former music writer [[Cameron Crowe]] had written articles about Poco and the Eagles during his journalism career. In 1982, his first screenplay was produced as the feature-length movie ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]].'' The film was co-produced by Eagles manager Azoff, who also co-produced the soundtrack album, released by Elektra. Henley, Walsh, Schmit, and Felder all contributed solo songs to the film's soundtrack. The band playing at the dance toward the end of the movie covers the Eagles song "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]".

Felder released a solo album, and contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'': "[[Heavy Metal (Takin' a Ride)]]" (with Henley and Schmit providing backing vocals) and "All of You". He also had a minor hit, "Bad Girls", off his solo album ''[[Airborne (Don Felder album)|Airborne]].''

Schmit had a prolific solo career after the band's initial breakup. He had a hit song on the ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' soundtrack with "[[So Much in Love]]". He contributed vocals to the [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] album ''[[Daylight Again]]'' on the songs "Southern Cross" and "[[Wasted on the Way]]" when that band needed an extra vocalist due to [[David Crosby]]'s drug overindulgence. Schmit sang backup vocals on [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s ''[[Toto IV]]'' album, including the song "[[I Won't Hold You Back]]" and appeared with the group on their 1982 European tour. He spent three years (1983–1985) as a member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s Coral Reefer band. He had a Top 40 solo hit in 1987 with "Boys' Night Out" and a top-30 Adult Contemporary hit with "Don't Give Up", both from his album ''Timothy B.'' Schmit appeared with Meisner and Walsh on [[Richard Marx]]'s debut single "[[Don't Mean Nothing]]". In 1992, Schmit and Walsh toured as members of Ringo Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]] and appeared on the live video from the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Schmit released two solo albums, ''Playin' It Cool'' in 1984 and ''Tell Me the Truth'' in 1990. He was the only Eagle to appear on the 1993 Eagles tribute album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]],'' singing backing vocals on [[Vince Gill]]'s cover of "I Can't Tell You Why".

Meisner hit the top 40 three times, including the number 19 "Hearts on Fire" in 1981.

===1994–2001: reunion, ''Hell Freezes Over''===
An Eagles country tribute album, titled ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'', was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup. [[Travis Tritt]] insisted on having the ''Long Run''-era Eagles in his video for "Take It Easy" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five ''Long Run''-era members—Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit—supplemented by [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), [[Timothy Drury]] (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and former [[Loggins and Messina]] sideman Al Garth (sax, violin) on stage.

"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation," said Frey at their first live performance in April 1994, one of two shows performed to record a live album and companion MTV special, both titled ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'' (named for Henley's recurring statement that the group would get back together "when hell freezes over"); the album debuted at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. It included four new studio songs, with "[[Get Over It (Eagles song)|Get Over It]]" and "[[Love Will Keep Us Alive]]" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved successful, selling six million copies in the U.S.

The band subsequently embarked on a tour in 1994, which was interrupted in September because of Frey's serious recurrence of [[diverticulitis]], but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Great Gastro-Intestinal Saga of Glenn Frey (1994–95) |url= http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm |url-status= dead |archive-date= October 11, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011185039/http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm}}</ref> In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, "Take It Easy" and "Hotel California". Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.<ref name="Fans">{{cite news|first= Lucy |last= Cockcroft |title= Eagles fans forced to pay £1,000 per ticket |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= October 12, 2007 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1565979/Eagles-fans-forced-to-pay-andpound1,000-per-ticket.html |archive-url= https://archive.today/20130505051711/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1565979/Eagles-fans-forced-to-pay-andpound1,000-per-ticket.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= May 5, 2013 |access-date= September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The price of fame |newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/Music/The-price-of-fame/2004/12/03/1101923322669.html |date= December 4, 2004 |access-date= September 19, 2008}}</ref>

The Eagles performed at the [[Mandalay Bay Events Center]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on December 28 and 29, 1999, followed by a concert at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles on December 31. These concerts marked the last time Felder played with the band and the shows (including a planned video release) would later form a part of a lawsuit filed by Felder against his former bandmates. The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc ''[[Selected Works: 1972–1999]]'' box set in November 2000. Along with the concert, this set included the band's hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from ''The Long Run'' sessions. ''Selected Works'' received [[Music recording sales certification#RIAA certification|platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title= Gold & Platinum – Eagles |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Eagles#search_section |publisher= Recording Industry Association of America |access-date= January 21, 2016}}</ref> The group resumed touring in 2001, with a line-up consisting of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit, along with [[Steuart Smith]] (guitars, mandolin, keyboards, backing vocals; essentially taking over Felder's role), Michael Thompson (keyboards, trombone), Will Hollis (keyboards, backing vocals), [[Scott F.

===2001–2007: Don Felder lawsuit===
[[File:Eagles in concert - Helsinki 2001.jpg|thumb|Eagles performing in Helsinki, 2001]]
On February 6, 2001, Don Felder was fired from the Eagles. He responded by filing two lawsuits against "Eagles, Ltd.", a California corporation; Don Henley, an individual; Glenn Frey, an individual; and "[[John Doe|Does]] 1–50", alleging wrongful termination, breach of implied-in-fact contract and breach of fiduciary duty, reportedly seeking $50{{nbsp}}million in damages.<ref name="Latimes">{{cite news|first= Jeff |last= Leeds |title= Reborn Eagles Lose Peaceful, Easy Feeling |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |page= C–1 |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-dec-08-fi-eagles-8-story.html |date= December 8, 2002 |access-date= November 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Brett |last= Attwood |title= Eagles Sued by Don Felder Over Dismissal |date= February 12, 2001 |publisher= [[Yahoo!

Felder accused them of coercing him into signing an agreement under which Henley and Frey would receive three times as much of the ''Selected Works: 1972–1999'' proceeds.

On behalf of Henley and Frey, attorney [[Daniel M. Petrocelli]] responded by saying "[Henley and Frey] felt—creatively, chemistry-wise and performance-wise—that he should no longer be part of the band ... They removed him, and they had every legal right to do so. This has been happening with rock 'n' roll bands since day one."<ref name="Latimes"/> Henley and Frey then countersued Felder for [[breach of contract]], alleging that Felder had written a "tell-all" book, ''[[Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles (1974–2001)]]''.

On January 23, 2002, the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] consolidated the two complaints, set a trial date for September 2006,{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=327}} and the single case was dismissed on May 8, 2007, after being settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=327}}

In 2003, the Eagles released a greatest hits album, ''[[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine |author-link= Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title= Eagles – The Very Best Of [2003] |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-2003-mw0002114338 |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= August 14, 2014}}</ref> The two-disc compilation was the first that encompassed their entire career from ''Eagles'' to ''Hell Freezes Over''. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard charts and eventually gained triple platinum status. The album included a new single, the [[September 11 attacks]]-themed "[[Hole in the World]]". Also in 2003, [[Warren Zevon]], a longtime Eagles friend, began work on his final album, ''[[The Wind (Warren Zevon album)|The Wind]]'', with the assistance of Henley, Walsh, and Schmit.

On June 14, 2005, the Eagles released a new 2-DVD set, ''[[Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne]]'', featuring two new songs: Frey's "No More Cloudy Days" and Walsh's "One Day at a Time." A special edition 2006 release, exclusive to [[Walmart]] and affiliated stores, includes a bonus audio CD with three new songs that were to appear on their upcoming studio album: "No More Cloudy Days", "Fast Company", and "Do Something".<ref>{{cite web|title= The Eagles package new music with Australian DVD |website= TheROCKradio |date= December 1, 2006 |url= http://www.therockradio.com/2006/12/eagles-package-new-music-with.html |archive-date= July 21, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190300/http://www.therockradio.com/2006/12/eagles-package-new-music-with.html}}</ref>

The initial U.S. release of Felder's book was canceled after publisher [[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] backed out in September 2007, when an entire print run of the book had to be recalled for cuts and changes. The book was published in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Sandall |date= October 28, 2007 |title= Hell may have frozen over, but the Eagles are still feuding |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]] |location= London |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2733019.ece |archive-date= May 17, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110517065227/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2733019.ece}}</ref> The American edition was published by [[John Wiley & Sons]] on April 28, 2008, with Felder embarking on a full publicity campaign surrounding its release.

[[File:Glenn Frey.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Glenn Frey performing in 2008]]
In 2007, the Eagles consisted of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit. On August 20, 2007, "[[How Long (J. D. Souther song)|How Long]]", written by [[JD Souther]], was released as a single to radio with an accompanying online video at [[Yahoo! Music]]. It debuted on television on [[Country Music Television]] on August 23, 2007. The band had performed the song as part of their live sets in the early to mid-1970s, but did not record it at the time because Souther wanted to reserve it for use on his first solo album. Souther had previously worked with the Eagles, co-writing some of their biggest hits, including "Best of My Love", "Victim of Love", "Heartache Tonight", and "New Kid in Town".

On October 30, 2007, the Eagles released ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', their first album of all-new material since 1979. For the first year after the album's release, it was available in the U.S. only via the band's website, at Walmart, and at [[Sam's Club]] stores.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Natalie |last= Zfat |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/don-henley-talks-new-eagles-lp-20070813 |title= Don Henley Talks New Eagles LP |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= August 13, 2007 |access-date= July 14, 2014}}</ref> It was commercially available through traditional retail outlets in other countries.

The Eagles made their awards show debut on November 7, 2007, when they performed "How Long" live at the [[Country Music Association Awards]].

On January 28, 2008, the second single of ''Long Road Out of Eden'' was released. "[[Busy Being Fabulous]]" peaked at number 28 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart<ref name="awards"/> and at number 12 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart.<ref name="awards">{{cite web|title= Eagles – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= January 20, 2016 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eagles-mn0000144847/awards}}</ref> The Eagles won their fifth Grammy [[2008 Grammy Awards|in 2008]], in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for "How Long".

On March 20, 2008, the Eagles launched their world tour in support of ''Long Road Out of Eden'' at [[The O2 Arena]] in London. The [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]] concluded the American portion of the tour at [[America First Field|Rio Tinto Stadium]] in [[Sandy, Utah]], on May 9, 2009. It was the first concert ever held in the new soccer stadium. The tour traveled to Europe, with its final concert date on July 22, 2009, in [[Lisbon]]. The band spent the summer of 2010 touring North American stadiums with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Keith Urban]]. The tour expanded to England as the headline act of the [[Hop Farm Festival]] on July 1, 2011.

Asked in November 2010 whether the Eagles were planning a follow-up to ''Long Road Out of Eden'', Schmit replied, "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again.

The band performed their 1976 album ''Hotel California'' in its entirety during three concerts at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in Las Vegas, Nevada in September and October 2019.

After just ten shows in early 2020, the remainder of the Hotel California Tour was postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The tour resumed in 2021, with North American dates spanning August to November. The band then announced the tour would continue into 2022, with dates in both the U.S. and Europe.<ref name="Gold"/> On April 6, 2022, the band announced on their [[Facebook]] page that Deacon Frey was leaving the group in order to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{cite web|author= Eagles |title= Deacon Frey has devoted the past 4½ years to carrying on his father's legacy and, after some weeks of reflection, he now feels that it is time for him to forge his own path. |via= [[Facebook]] |date= April 6, 2022 |access-date= May 3, 2022 |url= https://www.facebook.com/100044434299359/posts/544918676999271/?d=n}}</ref> Frey has since guested with the band on numerous occasions starting in June of that year.

In a 2022 interview with Loudersound, Schmit expressed doubt that the band would record a follow-up to ''Long Road Out of Eden'', stating "I sincerely doubt it. We toured behind our last album, ''Long Road Out Of Eden'' [2007], and put in five to seven of those songs. But we don’t do them any more because there wasn’t a big reaction. When people come to see the Eagles they want to hear 'Best Of My Love', 'One Of These Nights', all these things. So we give it to them."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/timothy-b-schmit-no-one-wants-to-hear-new-music-from-the-eagles|title=Timothy B.

== Formation ==
The roots for the formation of Flatland Cavalry were first laid when Cleto Cordero and Jason Albers began playing at local venues while rooming together at [[Midland College]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.midlandlivingmagazine.com/2019/05/28/200570/flatland-cavalry-takes-texas-by-storm|title=Flatland Cavalry takes Texas by Storm {{!}} Midland Living|last=|first=|date=|website=Midland Living|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The two had been jamming together since junior high but it was not until they moved to Lubbock in 2012 that the band began to take shape. It was here, while studying at [[Texas Tech University]], that the duo met Laura Jane at a house party. Jonathan Saenz and Reid Dillon joined the rest in 2014 and the band's lineup was complete.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":0" />

Cordero himself began playing the guitar at age 14 and wrote his first song by the time he was 17 years old for Lee High School's Rebel Lee Court Awards Ceremony.<ref name=":5" /> He writes most of the band's songs apart from playing the role of lead guitarist and singer with Jason Albers on drums, Jonathan Saenz on bass, Reid Dillon on guitar and Wesley Hall on fiddle. Hall took the place of Laura Jane when she parted ways with the band in 2018.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="koke" />

'''Fleet Foxes''' are an American [[indie folk]] band formed in [[Seattle]], Washington, in 2006. The band currently consists of [[Robin Pecknold]] (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), [[Christian Wargo]] (bass, guitar, backing vocals), and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone). Founding members Pecknold and Skjelset have been the only constants through the group's history, with the former serving as leader and principal songwriter.

The band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP ''[[Sun Giant]]'' and their [[Fleet Foxes (album)|eponymous debut album]] on [[Sub Pop]], both of which met with widespread critical acclaim. Their sophomore album ''[[Helplessness Blues]]'' (2011) earned further praise and became their greatest commercial success to date, reaching number 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Following a three-year break, Fleet Foxes reconvened in 2016 to record their third album ''[[Crack-Up (album)|Crack-Up]]'', which was released the following year on [[Nonesuch Records]]. This was followed by 2020's ''[[Shore (album)|Shore]]'', a ''de facto'' Pecknold solo album made without the involvement of his bandmates and released through the [[Anti- (record label)|Anti-]] label.

Though the group has experienced limited commercial success, their work has been consistently lauded by [[music critics]], who have praised their lyricism and production style and often noted the band's use of refined instrumentation and vocal harmonies. The band's debut album was ranked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' among the best of the decade and was also included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''. The band has been nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]], the first for [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album|Best Folk Album]] in 2012 for ''Helplessness Blues'' and the second for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2022 for ''Shore''.

==History==

===Formation and early years (2005–06)===
[[Robin Pecknold]] and Skyler Skjelset both attended [[Lake Washington High School]] in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Neil Young]] and began making music together.<ref name=RSHarmony>{{cite magazine |last=Scaggs |first=Austin |title=Fleet Foxes' Perfect Harmony |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 13, 2008 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/24012632/fleet_foxes_perfect_harmony |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106121640/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/24012632/fleet_foxes_perfect_harmony |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 6, 2008 |access-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on&mdash;Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and [[Hank Williams]] while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group.<ref name=Indep1>{{cite news |last=James |first=McNair |title=On the hunt for meaning with Seattle band Fleet Foxes |work=[[The Independent]] |date=June 13, 2008 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/on-the-hunt-for-meaning-with-seattle-band-fleet-foxes-846150.html |access-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and [[Brian Wilson]]. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's [[Dolour]] on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name "The Pineapples", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon "Fleet Foxes", suggesting that it was "evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting".<ref name=Indep1/> Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar.<ref>[http://www.seattlemag.com/article/power-25-fleet-foxes-expand-seattle-sound-1 "Fleet Foxes Expand Seattle Sound"], ''Seattle'' magazine</ref> The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer [[Phil Ek]] and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released ''[[Fleet Foxes (EP)|Fleet Foxes]]'' EP.<ref name=ST1>{{cite web |last=Scanlon |first=Tom |title=Fleet Foxes sing it their way |work=Seattle Times |date=September 22, 2006 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2003269559_nite22.html |access-date=December 3, 2008}}</ref> Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, "It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."<ref name=RSHarmony/> By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity.<ref name=ST1/> By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home.  However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.<ref name=RSHarmony/>

[[File:Fleet Foxes Coachella.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Fleet Foxes performing at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|2009 Coachella Festival]].]]
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound "less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s folk album ''[[Stormcock (album)|Stormcock]]'', saying, "That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record." He wanted the band to record very quickly, with "vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. [[Van Morrison]]'s ''[[Astral Weeks]]'', to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."<ref>{{cite news |last=Michaels |first=Sean |title=Fleet Foxes Recording 'Pretty Boring' Second Album |newspaper=The Guardian |date=December 7, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/07/fleet-foxes-second-album |access-date=December 14, 2013 |location=London}}</ref> The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former [[The Blood Brothers (band)|Blood Brothers]] bassist [[Morgan Henderson]] on upright bass and woodwind instruments.<ref>Hay, Travis [http://www.guerrillacandy.com/2011/04/17/fleet-foxes-add-a-blood-brother-for-sixth-member/ "Fleet Foxes add a Blood Brother for sixth member"] ''Guerilla Candy'', April 17, 2011</ref>

A 12" vinyl double A-side single of "Helplessness Blues" and "Grown Ocean" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for "The Shrine / An Argument".<ref>{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Robin |title=Watch: Fleet Foxes - The Shrine / An Argument |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=October 25, 2011 |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/watch-fleet-foxes-the-shrine-an-argument |access-date=October 25, 2011}}</ref>

''Helplessness Blues'' was nominated as [[Best Folk Album]] at the 2012 [[Grammy]] Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Tillman Leaves Fleet Foxes, Other Members Form New Band Poor Moon"] ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'', January 19, 2012</ref> He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as [[Father John Misty]], notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage. Pecknold would later reflect on Tillman's departure during a [[r/IAmA|Reddit AMA]] in October 2020:

<blockquote>[Tillman] "quit" the band after recording drums for ''Helplessness'', got into narcotics and made his first [Father John Misty] album while I was making ''Helplessness'' in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured ''Helplessness'' with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!<ref name="RedditAMA">{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/j7j37d/im_robin_pecknold_of_fleet_foxes_ask_me_anything/|title=I'm Robin Pecknold of Fleet Foxes - Ask me anything! |work=[[Reddit]]|date=October 8, 2020 |access-date=October 9, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

===''Crack-Up'' (2016–2018)===
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator [[Neal Morgan]], best known for his work with [[Joanna Newsom]] and [[Bill Callahan (musician)|Bill Callahan]]. Describing Morgan as a "full Fox", Pecknold also admitted he "had to up my songwriting game for homeboy." However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a "five-piece 'core band'", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQmPr_LjFr2|title=Shawn Brackbill|last=Pecknold|first=Robin|publisher=Instagram|date=February 17, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> Pecknold also said that the new material would be "a different vibe" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BFiBvIRr-kq/|title=No-Self-y|last=Pecknold|first=Robin|publisher=Instagram|date=May 18, 2016|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/24709128407/photos/a.10150796955053408.474915.24709128407/10154762552673408/?type=3&comment_id=10154762556993408&reply_comment_id=10154762560213408&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22:%22R9%22%7D|title=Fleet Foxes - Fleet Foxes updated their cover photo. |website=Facebook.com|access-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref>

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album ''Fleet Foxes''; the ''Sun Giant'' EP; the second studio album ''Helplessness Blues''; and an unknown third album entitled ''Ylajali''.<ref name="stereogum.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.stereogum.com/1917626/fleet-foxes-announce-lp3-ylajali-cover-art-new-label/news/|title=Fleet Foxes Announce LP3 Ylajali, Cover Art, New Label?|last=Rettig|first=James|publisher=Stereogum|date=December 25, 2016|access-date=December 25, 2016}}</ref> This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from [[Knut Hamsun]]'s novel ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]''; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer [[Hiroshi Hamaya]] as the cover art; and 3) be released through [[Nonesuch Records]], since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.<ref name="stereogum.com"/>

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company [[Mason Jar Music]] confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production.<ref>{{Cite news|title=New Fleet Foxes Album|date=January 1, 2017|work=Mason Jar Music Newsletter|via=Email}}</ref> The album was called ''Crack-Up'', after an [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] [[The Crack-Up|essay of the same name]]. The album is a concept album and was recorded at [[Electric Lady Studios]] and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, ''[[Crack-Up (album)|Crack-Up]]'', released on June 16, 2017, via [[Nonesuch Records]], a new label for the band. The lead single, "Third of May / Ōdaigahara", was released the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleet-foxes-announce-new-record-crack-up-us-tour-w470737|title=Fleet Foxes Preview First LP in Six Years With Epic New Song|last=Leight|first=Elias|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=March 7, 2017|access-date=March 7, 2017}}</ref> On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE_xsML2-uw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/uE_xsML2-uw| archive-date=November 17, 2021 | url-status=live|title=Fleet Foxes - Crack-Up (Album Trailer)|publisher=YouTube|date=April 4, 2017|access-date=April 4, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from ''Crack-Up'' along with a selection of older material and a cover of "[[Morning of My Life|In the Morning]]" by [[Bee Gees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://missoulian.com/entertainment/fleet-foxes-make-bracing-return-to-live-performance-at-missoula/article_cc2d7f0e-6fc5-5696-be63-62b66a5ecbcb.html|title=Fleet Foxes make bracing return to live performance at Missoula concert|last=Walsh|first=Cory|publisher=Missoulian|date=May 16, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> The band's live line-up included Matt Barrick of [[The Walkmen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/music/2017/05/19/fleet-foxes-make-a-tentative-comeback-at-crystal-ballroom/|title=Fleet Foxes Make a Tentative Comeback at Crystal Ballroom|last=Singer|first=Matthew|publisher=Willamette Week|date=May 19, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> who was also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to ''Crack-Up''. Barrick did not become an official member.  The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled ''The Electric Lady Session'', for [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] [[Record Store Day]] 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from ''Crack-Up'', originally recorded for their session at [[Fordham University]]'s radio station [[WFUV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fleet-foxes-announce-record-store-days-black-friday-vinyl-10/ |title=Fleet Foxes Announce Record Store Day's Black Friday Vinyl 10 |work=Pitchfork |date=October 10, 2017 |access-date=October 27, 2017 |author=Sodomsky, Sam}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://recordstoreday.com/NewsItem/7126 |title=FLEET FOXES BLACK FRIDAY 10 |work=RecordStoreDay.com |date=October 10, 2017 |access-date=October 27, 2017 |author=Record Store Day}}</ref> For [[Record Store Day]] 2018, the band released another EP, entitled "Crack Up (Choral Version)"/"In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/10096 |title=FLEET FOXES "Crack Up (Choral Version)"/"In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)" |website=RecordStoreDay.com |date=April 21, 2018 |access-date=April 25, 2018 |author=Record Store Day}}</ref>

===''Shore'' (2019–present)===
Work began on a fourth studio album in late 2018, not long after the Crack-Up tour finished. On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequence.net/2019/01/robin-pecknold-previews-new-fleet-foxes-album/|title=Robin Pecknold previews new Fleet Foxes album|website=Consequence.net|date=January 2, 2019}}</ref>

Recording began in September 2019 at Long Pond Studios in [[Hudson, New York]], and continued at other studios including [[Electro-Vox Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles. Pecknold collaborated closely with recording engineer Beatriz Artola during the recording process. Upon the outset of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Pecknold moved to [[New York City]] to be able to continue working with Artola. At this point, the majority of the music of the album was well-conceptualized, but the lyrics eluded Pecknold. He eventually developed the lyrics in part over the course of long drives in the New York countryside, and worked to finish the album in July and August 2020. Due to a desire to release the album quickly, Pecknold did not enlist the help of bandmates Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, or Henderson.<ref name="RS Feature">{{Cite magazine |last1=Vozick-Levinson |first1=Simon |last2=Vozick-Levinson |first2=Simon |date=September 22, 2020 |title=Robin Pecknold's Season of Rebirth |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/fleet-foxes-shore-robin-pecknold-interview-1064060/ |access-date=September 22, 2020 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Byrds.

==Biography==
===Life===
Clark was born in [[Tipton, Missouri]], the third of 13 children in a family of Irish, German, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] heritage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=2–4}}</ref> His family moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where as a boy he began learning to play the [[steel-string acoustic guitar|guitar]] and harmonica from his father.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=23}}</ref> He was soon playing [[Hank Williams]] tunes as well as songs by early rockers such as [[Elvis Presley]] and the [[Everly Brothers]]. He began writing songs at the age of 11.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=24}}</ref> By the time he was 15, he had developed a rich tenor voice, and he formed a local [[rock and roll]] combo, Joe Meyers and the Sharks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=25}}</ref> Like many of his generation, Clark developed an interest in [[folk music]] because of the popularity of [[The Kingston Trio]]. When he graduated from Bonner Springs High School, in [[Bonner Springs, Kansas]], in 1962, he formed a folk group, the Rum Runners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=28}}</ref>

===Formation of the Byrds===
[[File:The Byrds 1965.png|thumb|Clark (second from left) as a member of the Byrds in 1965]]
Clark was invited to join an established regional folk band, the Surf Riders, based in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] at the Castaways Lounge, owned by Hal Harbaum.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=29}}</ref> On August 12, 1963, he was performing with them when he was discovered by the [[The New Christy Minstrels|New Christy Minstrels]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=31}}</ref> They hired him, and he recorded two albums with the ensemble before leaving in early 1964.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=33–39}}</ref> After hearing the [[the Beatles|Beatles]], Clark quit the New Christy Minstrels and moved to Los Angeles, where he met fellow folkie and Beatles convert [[Roger McGuinn|Jim (later Roger) McGuinn]] at the Troubadour Club. In early 1964 they began to assemble a band that would become the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=44}}</ref>

Clark wrote or co-wrote many of the Byrds' best-known originals from their first three albums, including "[[I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better]]", "[[Set You Free This Time]]", "Here Without You", "You Won't Have to Cry", "If You're Gone", "The World Turns All Around Her", "[[She Don't Care About Time]]" and "[[Eight Miles High]]". He initially played rhythm guitar in the band, but relinquished that position to [[David Crosby]] and became the tambourine and harmonica player.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=50–51}}</ref> Bassist [[Chris Hillman]] noted years later in an interview remembering Clark, "At one time, he was the power in the Byrds, not McGuinn, not Crosby—it was Gene who would burst through the stage curtain banging on a tambourine, coming on like a young Prince Valiant. A hero, our savior. Few in the audience could take their eyes off this presence. He ''was'' the songwriter. He had the 'gift' that none of the rest of us had developed yet.... What deep inner part of his soul conjured up songs like 'Set You Free This Time,' 'I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better,' 'I'm Feelin' Higher,' 'Eight Miles High'? So many great songs! We learned a lot of songwriting from him and in the process learned a little bit about ourselves."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=512–513}}</ref>

A management decision gave McGuinn the lead vocals for their major singles and [[Bob Dylan]] songs. This disappointment, combined with Clark's dislike of traveling (including a chronic [[fear of flying]]) and resentment by other band members about the extra income he derived from his songwriting, led to internal squabbling, and he left the group in early 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=88}}</ref> He briefly returned to Kansas City before moving back to Los Angeles to form Gene Clark & the Group with [[Chip Douglas]], [[Joel Larson]], and Bill Rhinehart.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=97–109}}</ref>

===Solo career, brief return to the Byrds and Dillard and Clark===
[[Columbia Records]] (the Byrds' record label) signed Clark as a solo artist, and in 1967 he released his first solo album, ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]''. The Gosdin Brothers were selected to back him because they shared the same manager, Jim Dickson, and because Chris Hillman, who played bass on the album, had worked with the Gosdin Brothers in the mid-1960s when he and they were members of the Southern California bluegrass band the [[The Hillmen|Hillmen]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=113}}</ref> The album was a unique mixture of pop, country rock and baroque psychedelic tracks. It received favorable reviews, but unfortunately for Clark, it was released almost simultaneously with the Byrds' ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', also on Columbia, and (partly because of his 18-month absence from public attention) was a commercial failure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=116–117}}</ref>

With the future of his solo career in doubt, Clark briefly rejoined the Byrds in October 1967 as a replacement for the recently departed David Crosby; following an anxiety attack in Minneapolis, he left after only three weeks.<ref name="einarson">{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=126–127|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> During this brief period with the Byrds, he appeared with the band on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', lip-synching the group's current single, "[[Goin' Back]]"; he also performed "[[Mr. Spaceman]]" with the band.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher|author-link=Christopher Hjort|page=148|year=2008|title=So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> Although there is some disagreement among the band's biographers, Clark is generally viewed as having contributed background vocals to the songs "Goin' Back" and "Space Odyssey" for the forthcoming Byrds' album ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'' and was an uncredited co-author, with McGuinn, of "Get to You", also from that album.<ref name="einarson"/>

In 1968, Clark signed with [[A&M Records]] and began a collaboration with the banjo player [[the Dillards|Doug Dillard]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=130}}</ref> Guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]] (later with [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]), bassist Dave Jackson and mandolinist Don Beck joined them to form the nucleus of Dillard & Clark; in addition, Michael Clarke briefly drummed for the group before joining The Flying Burrito Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=131}}</ref> They produced two albums, ''[[The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]]'' (1968) and ''[[Through the Morning, Through the Night]]'' (1969).

''The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark'' was a pivotal work of acoustic country rock. It included such enduring songs as "Train Leaves Here This Morning" (a collaboration between Clark and Leadon prominently covered by the latter in 1972 on The Eagles' [[Eagles (album)|debut album]]) and "She Darked the Sun" (covered by [[Linda Ronstadt]] on her 1970 album ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]''). In contrast, ''Through the Morning, Through the Night'' was more indebted to [[traditional bluegrass]] but also employed electric instrumentation. By this juncture, Dillard's girlfriend Donna Washburn had joined the group as a backing vocalist, a factor that precipitated the departure of Leadon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=147}}</ref> The shift to traditional bluegrass also caused Clark to lose interest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=149}}</ref> Written by Clark, the title song was used by [[Quincy Jones]] in the soundtrack of the 1972 [[Sam Peckinpah]] film ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]''; it was also covered by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Alison Krauss]] (along with "Polly," another Clark-penned track from the album) on their 2007 album ''[[Raising Sand]]''. Both albums by Dillard & Clark fared poorly on the charts, but they are now regarded as seminal exemplars of the country rock and progressive bluegrass genres.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/65 65]|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/65}}</ref>
The collaboration with Dillard rejuvenated Clark's creativity but greatly contributed to his growing drinking problem.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=134}}</ref> Dillard & Clark disintegrated in late 1969 after the departures of Clark and Leadon. During this period, Clark, Leadon, Jackson and Beck contributed to the debut album of [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], ''[[Rock Salt & Nails (album)|Rock Salt & Nails]],'' released in November 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock|year=2003|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-743-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/eightmileshighfo00sanf/page/191 191]|url=https://archive.org/details/eightmileshighfo00sanf/page/191}}</ref>

In 1970, Clark began work on a new single, recording two tracks with the original members of the Byrds (each recording his part separately). The resulting songs, "She's the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred", were not released at the time, because of legal problems; they were included later on the 1973 album ''[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=161–162}}</ref> In 1970 and 1971, Clark contributed vocals and two compositions ("Tried So Hard" and "Here Tonight") to albums by the Flying Burrito Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=164}}</ref>

Frustrated with the music industry, Clark bought a house in [[Albion, California]] and married former go-go dancer and [[Bell Records]] production assistant Carlie Lynn McCummings in June 1970, with whom he had two sons (Kelly and Kai Clark). In semi-retirement, he subsisted on his still-substantial Byrds royalties throughout the early 1970s, augmented by income from [[The Turtles]]' 1969 American Top Ten hit "[[You Showed Me]]", a previously unreleased composition by McGuinn and Clark from 1964 rearranged for the band by Chip Douglas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-9529540-1-9|page=487}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Bush, John|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-mn0000564239/awards|title=The Turtles &#124; Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref>

===''White Light'' and ''Roadmaster''===
In 1971, Clark released his second solo album, ''[[White Light (Gene Clark album)|White Light]]'' (the title was not on the cover sleeve, and thus some later reviewers mistakenly assumed that the title was ''Gene Clark'').<ref name="Einarson 2005 167">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=167}}</ref> The album was produced by the Native American guitarist [[Jesse Ed Davis]], with whom Clark developed a great rapport, partly due to their common ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=4}}</ref> An intimate, poetic and mostly acoustic work supplemented by Davis's slide guitar, the album contained many introspective tracks, such as "With Tomorrow", "Because of You", "Where My Love Lies Asleep" and "For a Spanish Guitar" (which Bob Dylan reportedly hailed as one of the greatest songs ever written).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/157 157]|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/157}}</ref> All of the material was written by Clark, with the exception of Bob Dylan and [[Richard Manuel]]'s "[[Tears of Rage]]". Launched to considerable critical acclaim, the album failed to gain commercial success, except in the Netherlands, where it was voted album of the year by rock music critics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=168}}</ref> Once more, modest promotion and Clark's refusal to undertake promotional touring adversely affected sales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=486}}</ref>

In the spring of 1971, Clark was commissioned by [[Dennis Hopper]] to contribute the tracks "American Dreamer" and "Outlaw Song" to ''American Dreamer'', a documentary that chronicled the fractious editing process of ''[[The Last Movie]]''.<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/> A rerecorded, longer version of the song "American Dreamer" was later used in the 1977 film ''The Farmer'', along with an instrumental version of the same song plus "Outside the Law (The Outlaw)", a re-recording of "Outlaw Song".<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/>

In 1972, Clark attempted to record a follow-up album. Progress was slow and expensive, and A&M terminated the project before completion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=176}}</ref> The resulting eight tracks, including "Full Circle Song" and "In a Misty Morning", along with those recorded with the Byrds in 1970 and 1971 ("She's the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred") and with the Flying Burrito Brothers ("Here Tonight"), were released in 1973 as ''[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]'' in the Netherlands only.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=487}}</ref>

===''Byrds''===
Clark left A&M in late 1972 to join a reunion of the original five Byrds. They cut the album ''[[Byrds (album)|Byrds]]'', which was released in March 1973 by [[Asylum Records]]. While the album charted relatively well (U.S. No. 20), its placement did not live up to the label's initial expectations in the wake of the recent success of Crosby ([[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]) and Hillman (a member of [[Stephen Stills]]'s band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]]). Clark's compositions "[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]" and "Changing Heart" and the [[Neil Young]] covers on which he sang the lead vocal ("See the Sky About to Rain" and "Cowgirl in the Sand") were widely regarded as the standout tracks on the critically divisive album.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=182}}</ref> Disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with Crosby's performance as the record's producer, the group members chose to dissolve the band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=354}}</ref> Clark briefly joined McGuinn's solo group, with which he premiered "Silver Raven", arguably his most celebrated post-Byrds song.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182"/>

===''No Other''===
On the basis of the quality of Clark's contributions to ''Byrds'', [[David Geffen]] signed him to Asylum Records in early 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=369}}</ref> The label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singer-songwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadn't experienced since his days with the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=140}}</ref> While composing the album, he spent long periods with a notebook and an acoustic guitar at the picture window of his home, deriving inspiration from staring at the Pacific Ocean.

Produced by [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]] with a vast array of session musicians (including members of [[The Section (band)|The Section]] and the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]]) and backing singers, the ensuing ''[[No Other]]'' fused elements of country rock, folk, gospel, soul and choral music with poetic, mystical lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=488}}</ref> Although the album was praised by critics, its unconventional arrangements (which anticipated the later innovations of [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Christine McVie]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-other-mw0000202963|title=No Other – Gene Clark – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> limited public appeal. Furthermore, its high production costs (exceeding $100,000) prompted Geffen to publicly berate Clark and Kaye.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=192}}</ref> The album was minimally promoted and stalled in the ''Billboard'' album chart at No. 144.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=193}}</ref> In 2013, members of the bands [[Beach House]], [[The Walkmen]], [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]], and [[Fleet Foxes]] performed the album in its entirety in a series of concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53198-beach-house-fleet-foxes-walkmen-grizzly-bear-members-to-perform-gene-clarks-no-other-on-tour/|title=Beach House, Fleet Foxes, Walkmen, Grizzly Bear Members to Perform Gene Clark's No Other on Tour &#124; News|publisher=Pitchfork|date=December 3, 2013|access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref>

Clark's return to Los Angeles to record the album resulted in his reversion to a hedonistic lifestyle and accelerated the disintegration of his marriage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=189}}</ref> Disillusioned by professional and marital failure, he mounted his first solo tour by road, playing colleges and clubs with Roger White (lead guitar and backing vocals) and Duke Bardwell (electric bass, backing vocals and acoustic guitar); the drumless trio was billed as Gene Clark and the Silverados.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=194}}</ref>

In 2019, a remastered/remixed version of ''No Other'' was released.

===''Two Sides to Every Story''===
After the commercial failure of ''No Other'', Clark was confused about his artistic direction. Throughout 1975 and 1976, he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of "cosmic" songs fusing country rock with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[funk]], elaborating on the soundscapes of his most recent album. In 1976, he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness. These were submitted to [[RSO Records]], which promptly bought out Clark's Asylum contract and issued the long-gestating ''[[Two Sides to Every Story]]'' in 1977. The album—a melange of bluegrass, traditional [[honky tonk]], echoes of ''No Other'' ("Sister Moon") and strident country rock (a new arrangement of "Kansas City Southern")—was produced by Kaye with an understated touch.<ref name="Rogan 2008 370">{{cite book|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|publisher=Rogan House|year=2008|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|location=London England|page=370}}</ref>

The emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of Clark's compositions, including the aforementioned "Sister Moon", "Lonely Saturday", "Past Addresses", "Silent Crusade" and "Hear the Wind". The album also contains covers of the traditional "In the Pines" (a key component of Clark's live repertoire with the Silverados) and "Give My Love to Marie" by [[James Talley]]. Once again, his style of sensitive balladry failed to achieve success on the U.S. charts. In a belated attempt to find an appreciative public, he reluctantly overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the KC Southern Band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=490–491}}</ref> Some six weeks before his death in 1991, Clark told interviewer [[Bill Wasserzieher]] that he considered ''Two Sides to Every Story'' his best album, rivaled only by ''No Other''.<ref>Wasserzieher, Bill.

For his British tour dates, Clark found himself on the same bill as ex-Byrds [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Chris Hillman]], each fronting their own bands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=372}}</ref> Shortly after returning to the United States, Clark and McGuinn began touring as an acoustic duo. After Hillman joined his former bandmates, the reformed trio named themselves [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]] and signed with [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=382}}</ref> Produced by [[the Albert Brothers]] (who had recently recorded Crosby, Stills & Nash's [[CSN (album)|1977 comeback album]]), the ensuing ''McGuinn, Clark & Hillman'' (1979) was a rebirth in both performing and songwriting for Clark, who ensconced himself as the group's dominant creative force. He wrote four songs for the album, including "Backstage Pass" (a rumination on the ennui of touring and his fear of flying), "Release Me Girl" (a [[disco]]-inflected collaboration with [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]]), the [[UFO]]-inspired "Feelin' Higher" and "Little Mama".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=385–387}}</ref>

Many critics felt that the album's slick production and [[disco]]-influenced [[soft rock]] rhythms didn't flatter the group, but the album reached No. 39 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (underpinned by the McGuinn-penned "Don't You Write Her Off", which peaked at No. 33 in May 1979) and earned a [[RIAA]] gold certification, selling well enough to generate a follow-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310280/mcguinn-clark-hillman/chart|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman – Chart history|publisher=Billboard|date=May 12, 1979|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref> McGuinn, Clark and Hillman's second release was to have been a full group effort entitled ''City''; although it was ultimately released in 1980, a combination of Clark's unreliability (including experimentation with heroin) and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction (mostly regarding Ron and Howard Albert's production) resulted in the album being credited to "Roger McGuinn & Chris Hillman featuring Gene Clark." Despite the turmoil, Clark penned the song "Won't Let You Down". By 1981, Clark had left, and the group recorded one more album as "McGuinn/Hillman".<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=227–231}}</ref>

===Rehabilitation, ''Firebyrd'' and ''So Rebellious a Lover''===
Clark moved to Hawaii with Jesse Ed Davis to try to overcome his drug dependency, remaining there until the end of 1981.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=492}}</ref> Upon his return to Los Angeles, he assembled a new band, the Firebyrds, and in 1982 proceeded to record what would eventually become the album ''Firebyrd''. While waiting for the album to be released, Clark joined up with Chris Hillman and others in an abortive venture called Flyte, which failed to secure a recording contract and was quickly dissolved.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=239–242}}</ref> The eventual release of ''Firebyrd'' in 1984 coincided with the emergence of jangle rockers like [[R.E.M.]] and [[Tom Petty]], who had sparked a new interest in the Byrds. Clark also began developing new fans among LA's roots-conscious [[Paisley Underground]] scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=250–251}}</ref> Later in the decade, he embraced his new status by appearing as a guest with the [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]], in a session arranged by Saul Davis and he cut an acclaimed duo album with [[Carla Olson]] of the Textones titled ''[[So Rebellious a Lover]]'' (including the notable "[[Gypsy Rider]]" and "Del Gato") in 1986. The album included contributions from Chris Hillman, Stephen McCarthy (of The Long Ryders) and Randy Fuller (of the [[Bobby Fuller Four]]) and was produced and arranged by session drummer [[Michael Huey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-huey-p88388/credits|title=Michael Huey – Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Later career, illness and death===
In 1985, Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman regarding a reformation of the Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]".<ref name="byrdwatcher12">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Byrds v. Byrds: The 20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds 1984–1988|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spname1.html|access-date=May 25, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429120942/http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spname1.html|archive-date=April 29, 2010}}</ref> The three of them showed no interest. Clark decided to assemble a "[[superstar]]" collection of musicians, including ex-[[Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Firefall]] member [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], ex-[[Beach Boys]] singer and guitarist [[Blondie Chaplin]], ex-[[The Band|Band]] members [[Rick Danko]] and [[Richard Manuel]], and ex-Byrds [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] and [[John York (musician)|John York]]. Clark initially called his band "The 20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds" and began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|page=255|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> A number of [[Tour promoter|concert promoters]] began to shorten the band's name to "the Byrds" in advertisements and promotional material.<ref name="byrdwatcher12"/> As the band continued to tour throughout 1985, their agent decided to shorten the name to "the Byrds" permanently, to the displeasure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman. Clark eventually discontinued performing with his own "Byrds" band, but drummer Clarke continued on with Skip Battin (occasionally with ex-Byrds York and Gene Parsons), forming another "Byrds" group, prompting McGuinn, Hillman, and Crosby to go on the road as "the Byrds" in an attempt to establish a claim to the rights to the name. Their effort failed this time; Clark was not included in the reunion, primarily because of his involvement with the act that didn't include them. Crosby finally secured rights to the name in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Terry Jones|title=Younger Than Yesterday: Biography|publisher=terryjonesrogers.com|url=http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|access-date=April 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212021/http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Varga|first=George|title=CD Proves to Everything There Is a Season| date = September 24, 2006 | work =[[The San Diego Union-Tribune|San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html|access-date=April 25, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018221327/http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html | archive-date = October 18, 2012 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

Despite the critical success of ''So Rebellious a Lover'', which led to several TV appearances (including ''[[Nashville Now]]''), Clark was increasingly afflicted with serious health problems, including [[ulcers]] and [[alcohol dependence]]. In 1988, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant ulcer.

A period of abstinence and recovery followed until [[Tom Petty]] covered "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better" on ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'' (1989), yielding a windfall of royalties from the album (which peaked at No. 3 in the United States) to Clark. Flush with money, he began to neglect his professional obligations. Although the circumstances remain nebulous (with Carla Olson citing alleged financial improprieties), the binge also precipitated his final break-up with Terri Messina, who had had a two-decade [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Clark.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=286}}</ref>

During this period, The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1991, at which the original lineup performed several songs together, including Clark's "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Byrds Setlist at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony #6|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-byrds/1991/waldorf-astoria-hotel-new-york-ny-4bc56ba2.html|website=setlist.fm|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>

Clark's health continued to decline as his substance abuse accelerated, and he was diagnosed with throat cancer in early 1991. He died on May 24, 1991, at the age of 46 from [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] as a result of a bleeding ulcer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Archives |first=L. A.

===Covers and tribute songs===
During his career and after his death, Clark's songs have been covered by a number of artists. [[Iain Matthews]] was an early promoter of Clark's songs, covering "Polly" on his 1972 album ''[[Journeys from Gospel Oak]]''  and "Tried So Hard" on his 1974 album ''[[Some Days You Eat the Bear]]''. "Tried So Hard" was later covered by [[Yo la Tengo]] on ''[[Fakebook (album)|Fakebook]]'' in 1990. [[Death in Vegas]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] covered his song "So You Say You Lost Your Baby" on their 2003 album ''[[Scorpio Rising (Death in Vegas album)|Scorpio Rising]]''. In 1993 the Scottish band [[Teenage Fanclub]] recorded a tribute entitled "Gene Clark" on their album ''[[Thirteen (Teenage Fanclub album)|Thirteen]]''.

In 2007, two of his songs were recorded by [[Alison Krauss]] and [[Robert Plant]] on the [[T-Bone Burnett]]–produced ''[[Raising Sand]]'':  "Polly Come Home" and "Through the Morning, Through the Night." Also in 2007, [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris]] and [[Rich Robinson]] released a live version of "Polly" on their album ''[[Brothers of a Feather: Live at the Roxy]]''. [[This Mortal Coil]] covered "Strength of Strings" from his album ''No Other'' and "With Tomorrow" from his album ''White Light''. [[Soulsavers]] with [[Mark Lanegan]] recorded a version of "Some Misunderstanding" from ''No Other'' on their 2009 release, ''[[Broken (Soulsavers album)|Broken]]''. The song "Gorgeous" from [[Kanye West]]'s 2010 album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' is based on elements of The Turtles' cover of "You Showed Me".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy|title-link=My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy|others=[[Kanye West]]|year=2010|page=11|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Roc-A-Fella Records]]}}</ref>

==Documentary==
A documentary about Clark's life and career, entitled ''The Byrd Who Flew Alone'', was released in 2013, featuring contributions from family, friends, the three surviving original members of the [[The Byrds|Byrds]], latter-day Byrd John York and late-era collaborators Carla Olson and Pat Robinson. The documentary revealed that Clark was suffering from throat cancer at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foursunsproductions.com/Gene-Clark-Documentary/|title="The Byrd Who Flew Alone: The Triumphs And Tragedy Of Gene Clark" Documentary|publisher=www.foursunsproductions.com|access-date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>

'''Gina Villalobos''' is an American singer-songwriter and composer. From 1992 thorough 2013, she extensively toured and recorded in the United States, the UK and Europe, writing songs and making music in bands and as a solo artist. Counting her most recent release, ''Sola'' (2014), Villalobos has released five solo studio albums. She continues to sing and compose in her work as a music creator at ''Feverpitch'', where she services the motion picture industry, specifically those companies making movie [[trailer music]]. She creates sound effects, produces music, and composes original scores.

== Early life ==
Villalobos spent her childhood in the [[Santa Monica]] Mountain community of Lake Sherwood, California. By way of inspiration, Gina's mother handed down her passion for music, while her father [[Reynaldo Villalobos]] is an acclaimed [[cinematographer]] and director.<ref name="dostuff" /> By the time she was seven, Villalobos was teaching herself guitar, and began her music career at the end of college.

== Musical career ==
In her early 20s, Villalobos fronted and played guitar in the acoustic folk trio Liquid Sunshine. Together, they recorded the albums ''Sweet Commitment'' and ''Barbary Lane'', as well as the self-titled ''Liquid Sunshine EP'' before disbanding in 1996. Between 1997 and 2001, Villalobos fronted the band The Mades, with whom she recorded two albums, before starting her solo career with 2002's ''Beg From Me''.<ref name="dostuff" />

In 2004, she caught the attention of respected U.S. publications like ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'', ''[[Acoustic Guitar (magazine)|Acoustic Guitar]]'', and ''[[Harp (magazine)|Harp]]''.<ref>[http://ginavillalobos.bandzoogle.com/press/  Press quotes collection].</ref> In anticipation of her sophomore studio album, ''Live from [[KXLU]] Radio'' was released, containing a live recording with songs off the new album. With her second outing, ''Rock 'N' Roll Pony'', the European press and radio praised the CD, which reached No. 3 on the Euro-Americana charts, and by 2005, Villalobos was performing in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. She toured with [[Laura Veirs]]<ref>[http://lauraveirs.com/  Laura Veirs main page]</ref> in 2005 on her UK tour.  Her 2007 self-release ''Miles Away'' repeated her previous successes in the U.K. press and on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Around that time, the alternative rock band [[World Party]]<ref>[http://www.worldparty.net/  World Party Main Page]</ref> invited Villalobos to tour the States with them, and her songs started showing up in movies and TV shows like ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and ''[[Army Wives]]''. Two years later, Gina delivered ''Days on Their Side''.

Villalobos has been associated with [[Anne McCue]],<ref>[http://www.annemccue.com/ Anne McCue Main Page]</ref> and has been recognized for her contribution to California songs.

In 2014, after an extended hiatus and having taken the time to produce the album since January 2012,<ref name="dostuff" /> ''Sola'' was released. She produced and Erik Colvin engineered, as he's done for each of her previous three offerings. Augmenting Gina's vocals and guitar are guitarist Kevin Haaland ([[Andy Grammer]]), back for his fourth Gina Villalobos album, and returning guitarist Josh Grange ([[Sheryl Crow]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Beck]], [[Dixie Chicks]]); Also credited are Eric Heywood ([[Son Volt]], [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[The Pretenders]], [[Alejandro Escovedo]]) on pedal steel. Upright bass was performed by Ian Walker (k.d. lang, [[Cher]], [[Paula Cole]], [[The Ditty Bops]]). Quinn ([[Tracy Chapman]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Paula Cole]]) was the drummer.

In late 2015, The [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[Amazon Studios]] TV show, ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502262/ Transparent IMDB link]</ref> selected the arrangement featuring the 
Gina Villalobos/Eric Colvin produced version<ref>[https://ginavillalobos.bandcamp.com/track/family-affair-derivative-work Family Affair stream on Bandcamp]</ref> of the 1971 [[Sly and the Family Stone]] hit "[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]" featuring the vocals of [[Ruby Friedman]] for use in the trailer promoting the launch of Season 2.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CluxHR9pkdQ Official Amazon Studio Transparent Season 2 Trailer]</ref>

Villalobos resides in the Los Angeles community of [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]], California.

In October 2003, halfway through the sessions for ''Rock 'N Roll Party'', production was halted when Villalobos sustained serious injury to her right eye.  After numerous retinal surgeries, she was informed she would be permanently blind in her right eye.

After his return to Canada, Lightfoot performed with the Singin' Swingin' Eight, a group featured on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] TV's ''[[Country Hoedown]]'', and with the Gino Silvi Singers. He soon became known at Toronto folk music-oriented coffee houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nicholasjennings.com/before-the-gold-rush|title=Before the Gold Rush - Flashbacks to the Dawn of the Canadian Sound| website= Nicholasjennings.com|date=August 16, 2009 |access-date=September 26, 2021}}</ref><ref>McPherson, David.

===1960s===

In 1965, Lightfoot signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]],<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=May 2, 2023 |title=Gordon Lightfoot, Canadian Folk Rock Troubadour, Dead at 84 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gordon-lightfoot-dead-obituary-1234716529/ |url-access=limited |access-date=May 2, 2023 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> who also represented many prominent American folk performers, and signed a recording contract with [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] who released his version of "[[I'm Not Sayin']]" as a single. Appearances at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', and New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] increased his following and bolstered his reputation. 1966 marked the release of his debut album ''[[Lightfoot!]]'', which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter. The album featured many now-famous songs, including "For Lovin' Me", "Early Mornin' Rain", "Steel Rail Blues", and "Ribbon of Darkness". On the strength of the ''Lightfoot!'' album, which blended Canadian and universal themes, Lightfoot became one of the first Canadian singers to achieve definitive home-grown stardom without having moved permanently to the United States to develop it. Lightfoot also recorded in the [[Nashville, Tennessee]] area at [[Bradley's Barn|Forest Hills Music Studio ("Bradley's Barn")]] run by [[Owen Bradley]] and his son [[Jerry Bradley (music executive)|Jerry]] during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |access-date=May 2, 2023 |title=Jerry Bradley |website=Country Music Hall of Fame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816221321/https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |archive-date=August 16, 2022}}</ref>

To kick off Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|Centennial]] year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned Lightfoot to write the "[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]" for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967.  Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: ''[[The Way I Feel (Gordon Lightfoot album)|The Way I Feel]]'' (1967), ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' (1968), ''[[Back Here on Earth]]'' (1968), and the live recording ''[[Sunday Concert]]'' (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including "Go-Go Round", "Spin, Spin", and "The Way I Feel". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's "[[Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'', released in January 1968, featured "Black Day in July", about the 1967 Detroit riot. Weeks later, upon the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for "fanning the flames", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony.  Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs "that make people happy" and not those "that make people think."  Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to [[Warner Bros. Records]], scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with "If You Could Read My Mind".

Lightfoot's albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer, yet he was to find commercial success there before he was fully appreciated in his own country.<ref name="Edwardson2009">{{cite book |last1=Edwardson |first1=Ryan |title=Canuck Rock: A History of Canadian Popular Music |date=2009 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-9989-1 |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwc4o2qntH4C&pg=PA165}}</ref><ref name="Marsh1999">{{cite book |editor1-last=Marsh |editor1-first=James H. |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=1999 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |isbn=978-0-7710-2099-5 |pages=1865–1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&pg=PA1865}}</ref>

His success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s. He embarked on his first Canadian national tour in 1967, and also performed in New York City. Between 1967 and 1974, Lightfoot toured Europe and was well-received on two tours of Australia.

UA continued to release "Best of" album compilations in the 1970s even after Lightfoot became a success at Warner Bros./Reprise.

===1970s===
Lightfoot signed to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 and scored a major hit in the United States with "[[If You Could Read My Mind]]", which sold over one million copies by early 1971 and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

After the song's success, the album was reissued under the new title ''If You Could Read My Mind;'' it reached No.&nbsp;5 nationally and represented a major turning point in Lightfoot's career.<ref name="BBC" /> The album also featured a second recorded version of "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]", as well as "The Pony Man", "Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster)", and "Minstrel of the Dawn".

Over the next seven years, he recorded a series of successful albums that established him as a singer-songwriter:
* ''[[Summer Side of Life]]'' (1971), with songs "Ten Degrees and Getting Colder", "Miguel", "Cabaret", "Nous Vivons Ensemble", and the title track
* ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' (1972), with "[[Beautiful_(Gordon_Lightfoot_song)|Beautiful]]", "Looking at the Rain", "Christian Island (Georgian Bay)", and the title track

* ''[[Cold on the Shoulder (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Cold on the Shoulder]]'' (1975). Along with title track are songs "Bend in the Water", "The Soul Is the Rock", "Rainbow Trout", "All the Lovely Ladies" and the hit "Rainy Day People"
* A double compilation LP ''[[Gord's Gold]]'' (in 1975) containing nine new versions of his most popular songs from the United Artists era<ref>The selections on ''Gord's Gold'' and ''Gord's Gold Volume II,'' as explained in the liner remarks for ''Gord's Gold,'' are all re-recordings because Lightfoot dislikes listening to his earlier material.</ref>

* ''[[Endless Wire (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Endless Wire]]'' (1978) with "Daylight Katy", "If Children Had Wings", "Sweet Guinevere", a new version of "The Circle Is Small" from ''Back Here on Earth'', and the title track

During the 1970s, Lightfoot's songs covered a wide range of subjects, including "Don Quixote", about Cervantes' famous literary character, "Ode to Big Blue", about the widespread killing of whales, "Beautiful", about the simple joys of love, "Carefree Highway", about the freedom of the open road, "Protocol", about the futility of war, and "Alberta Bound", which was inspired by a lonely teenaged girl named Grace he met on a bus while travelling to [[Calgary]] in 1971.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

In 1972, Lightfoot contracted [[Bell's palsy]], a condition that left his face partially paralyzed for a time. The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single "[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]" from the album ''Sundown'' went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1974|No.1]] on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' series. "Carefree Highway" (about [[Arizona State Route 74]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was the follow-up single from the same album. It charted in the Top 10 in both countries.<ref>{{cite web |author=William R.

In late November 1975, Lightfoot read a ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine article<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gordonlightfoot.com/WreckOfTheEdmundFitzgerald.shtml |title=Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald - Gordon Lightfoot Song Lyrics |work=gordonlightfoot.com |year=2011 |access-date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> about the loss of the {{SS|Edmund Fitzgerald}}, which sank on November 10, 1975, on [[Lake Superior]] during a severe storm with the loss of all 29 crew members. The lyrics in his song, "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]", released the following year, were substantially based on facts in the article. It reached number two on the United States ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart and was a number one hit in Canada. Lightfoot appeared at several 25th anniversary memorial services of the sinking, and stayed in personal contact with the family members of the men who perished in the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssedmundfitzgerald.org/gordon-lightfoot-song/|title="The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" by Gordon Lightfoot|publisher=S S Edmund Fitzgerald Online|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref>

In 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of "The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes)," which reached number 33.

===1980s and 1990s===
During the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: ''[[Dream Street Rose]]'' (1980), ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' (1982), ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' (1983), ''[[East of Midnight]]'' (1986), another compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]]'' (1988), ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993), and ''[[A Painter Passing Through]]'' (1998).

The album ''Dream Street Rose'' has the folk-pop sound that Lightfoot established during the previous decade. In addition to the title song, it includes songs such as "Ghosts of Cape Horn" and "On the High Seas". It also includes the [[Leroy Van Dyke]] 1950s composition "The Auctioneer", a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-like number that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. The album ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' represents a departure from the acoustic sound of his guitar playing in the 1970s and introduces an adult-contemporary sound. Songs like "Shadows" and "Thank You for the Promises" contain an underlying sadness and resignation. The 1982 American released single "Baby Step Back" marked his last time in the top 50 in that country.
The 1983 album ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' produced no hit singles; the 1986 ''East of Midnight'' album had several [[Adult Contemporary]] songs like "A Passing Ship", "Morning Glory", and "I'll Tag Along" (East of Midnight). A single from ''East of Midnight'', "Anything for Love", made the 1986 Billboard Country and Western chart.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSQEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22Anything+for+Love%22+billboard+country+and+western+chart&pg=PA35|title=Anything for Love; Billboard|date=October 18, 1986|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>

In April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer [[Michael Masser]], claiming that Masser's melody for the song "The Greatest Love of All", versions of which were recorded and released by [[George Benson]] in 1977 and [[Whitney Houston]] in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song "If You Could Read My Mind". The transitional section that begins "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow" of the Masser song has the same melody as "I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back" of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated that he did not want people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Florian BODENSEHER |url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/biography.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot – Biography |website=Corfid.com |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and Masser issued a public apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storyofsongs.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-love.html |title=Greatest Love |date=August 29, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref> Lightfoot rounded out the decade with his follow-up compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]],'' in late 1988, which contained re-recorded versions of his most popular songs, including a re-make of the 1970 song "The Pony Man". The original had been brisk in pace, acoustic, and about three minutes long. This new version was slower, clocking in at four minutes plus. Lightfoot performed with Canadian singer-songwriter [[Ian Tyson]] at the opening ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary.

During the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993) includes songs such as "Restless", "Wild Strawberries", and Bob Dylan's "Ring Them Bells".  1998's ''A Painter Passing Through'' reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chrispell|first=James|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&q=With+the+release+of+A+Painter+Passing+Through%2C+Lightfoot+appears+to+have+found+home+and+has+turned+in+his+best+work+in+years.+Gone+are+the+uncertain+arrangements+of+the+past%3B+in+their+place%2C+there+is+a+welcome+return+to+the+essence+of+the+%22Sundown%22+musical+era.&pg=PA654|title=All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2002|isbn=9780879306533|editor-last=Bogdanov|editor-first=Vladimir|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=654|chapter=A Painter Passing Through / May 12, 1998 / Reprise|editor-last2=Woodstra|editor-first2=Chris|editor-last3=Erlewine|editor-first3=Stephen Thomas}}</ref> with songs like "Much to My Surprise", "Red Velvet", "Drifters", and "I Used to Be a Country Singer".

===2000s===
In April 2000, Lightfoot taped a live concert in [[Reno, Nevada]]; this one-hour show was broadcast by [[CBC Television|CBC]] in October, and as a PBS special across the United States. PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, closing the show.  In May, he performed "Ring Them Bells" at [[Massey Hall]] in honour of Bob Dylan's 60th birthday.

By January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in [[Orillia]], Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to [[McMaster University Medical Centre]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. He underwent emergency [[vascular surgery]] for a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-is-happy-to-be-all-live|title=Gordon Lightfoot is happy to be All Live|date=April 27, 2012|newspaper=National Post|access-date=September 20, 2018|last1=Kaplan|first1=Ben}}</ref> and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Lightfoot endured a six-week coma and a [[tracheotomy]], and he underwent four surgical operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1197/is_/ai_n16519941 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210091226/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1197/is_/ai_n16519941 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 10, 2008 |title=CBSi |website=FindArticles.com |access-date=December 17, 2016 }}</ref> All of his remaining 2002 concert dates were cancelled. More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.

In 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with [[Linus Entertainment]] and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness.  Also in 2003, [[Borealis Records]], a label related to Linus Entertainment, released ''Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot''.  On this album, various artists, including The [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Jesse Winchester]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and [[The Tragically Hip]] interpreted Lightfoot's songs. The final track on the album, "Lightfoot", was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by [[Aengus Finnan]].

In January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on his album ''[[Harmony (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Harmony]]'', which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on his new home label of Linus Records on May 11 of that year.  It was his 20th original album and included a single and new video for "Inspiration Lady". Other songs on the album are "Clouds of Loneliness", "Sometimes I Wish", "Flyin' Blind", and "No Mistake About It". The album also contains the upbeat yet reflective track called "End of All Time" In July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing "I'll Tag Along" solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Lightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance – on their own instruments – of his ''[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]''. In 2005, he made a low-key tour called the ''Better Late Than Never Tour''.

On September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that temporarily left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-dead-1.6828991 |title=Canadian folk music icon Gordon Lightfoot dead at 84 |author=Susan Noakes |date=May 1, 2023 |website=cbc.ca |access-date=May 1, 2023}}</ref> He returned to performing nine days later and for a brief time used a substitute guitarist for more difficult guitar work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/lightfoot |title=Music: Stroke doesn't diminish Lightfoots skills as an entertainer |date=September 25, 2006 |website=Onmilwaukee.com |access-date=May 1, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Denis Armstrong |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710212859/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |url-status=usurped |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=CANOE – JAM!

==Sound and legacy==
Lightfoot's sound, both in the studio and on tour, was centred on Lightfoot's [[baritone]] voice and folk-based [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve-string]] acoustic guitar.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/gordon-lightfoot|title=Gordon Lightfoot|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|date=August 2, 2017|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref> From 1965 to 1970, lead guitarist [[Laurice Milton “Red” Shea|Red Shea]] was an important supporting player, with bassists Paul Wideman and John Stockfish filling out the arrangements.
[[File:Gordon Lightfoot.jpg|thumb|left|Performing in Toronto, 2008, playing his [[twelve-string guitar]]]]
In 1968 bassist Rick Haynes joined the band, and lead guitarist Terry Clements joined the following year. Shea left the touring band in 1970, but continued to record with Lightfoot until 1975. He hosted his own Canadian variety show, played with Ian Tyson, and became band leader for [[Tommy Hunter]]'s TV show in the 1980s on CBC. Shea played on most of Lightfoot's early hits.  Haynes and Clements remained with Lightfoot and composed the core of his band.

In 1975, Pee Wee Charles added [[pedal steel]] guitar to Lightfoot's songs. Drummer Barry Keane joined the following year and in 1981, keyboardist Mike Heffernan completed the ensemble. This five-piece backup band remained intact until 1987, when Charles left the band to operate a radio station in Southern Ontario.

Three members of Lightfoot's band died over the years: Red Shea in June 2008 from pancreatic cancer, Clements at 63 on February 20, 2011, following a stroke,<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2011.html |title=2011 January to June |work=The Dead Rock Stars Club |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> and original bassist John Stockfish from natural causes on August 20, 2012, at 69.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20120830.93301879/BDAStory/BDA/deaths |title=John Stockfish |work=globeandmail.com |date=August 30, 2012 |access-date=September 2, 2012 |location=Toronto |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022020423/http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20120830.93301879/BDAStory/BDA/deaths |archive-date=October 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Haynes, Keane, and Heffernan continued to tour and record with Lightfoot, adding guitarist Carter Lancaster from Hamilton, Ontario, in 2011; a "great player", according to Lightfoot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/gordon-lightfoot-remembers-late-guitarist-clements-as-one-of-his-best-friends-117076653.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308033940/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/gordon-lightfoot-remembers-late-guitarist-clements-as-one-of-his-best-friends-117076653.html|url-status=dead|title=Winnipeg Free Press|archivedate=March 8, 2011|via=www.winnipegfreepress.com}}</ref>

Alexander Carpenter, professor of [[musicology]] at the  [[University of Alberta]], noted the number of tributes to Lightfoot in the media that held him as "quintessentially Canadian" and questioned whether this [[nationalist]], nostalgic view [blurred] "the reality that Lightfoot was a musician who had a much wider influence on the popular music scene of the 1970s, well beyond Canada’s borders".<ref name="Carpenter">{{Cite web |last=Carpenter |first=Alexander |date=June 18, 2023 |title=Gordon Lightfoot's musical legacy extended beyond Canada to reflect universal themes |url=https://theconversation.com/gordon-lightfoots-musical-legacy-extended-beyond-canada-to-reflect-universal-themes-205064 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230721220238if_/https://theconversation.com/gordon-lightfoots-musical-legacy-extended-beyond-canada-to-reflect-universal-themes-205064 |archive-date=July 21, 2023 |access-date=July 23, 2023 |website=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]}}</ref> Carpenter contended that Lightfoot both romanticized Canadian history and looked more deeply into the country's past – an aspect of his music that has been "largely lost in the effusive eulogies in the media".  Lightfoot's gentle, sentimental delivery style was noted by Carpenter as evoking a nostalgia, but this was not necessarily a "compelling or accurate portrait of Canada", with the article concluding: "Simply casting Lightfoot as an exemplar of Canadian-ness overshadows Lightfoot's legacy. He was a songsmith and a musician who toiled for his entire career – spanning nearly six decades – to bring words and music together in meaningful and enduring ways."<ref name=Carpenter/>

==Personal life and death==
Lightfoot was married three times. His first marriage in April 1963 was to Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, a Swede, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot acknowledged that his musical touring and the fact that he found fidelity difficult in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.

The song "[[If You Could Read My Mind]]" was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performed the lyrics with a slight change: the line "I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack" is altered to "I'm just trying to understand the feelings that ''we'' lack." He said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.

Lightfoot was single for 16 years and had two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages: Gaylen McGee and Eric Lightfoot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corfid.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-15235.html |title=Gord's eldest children |website=Gordon Lightfoot Forums |access-date=December 3, 2017}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, Lightfoot was involved with [[Cathy Smith]]; their volatile relationship inspired his songs "[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]" and "[[Rainy Day People]]" among others. "Cathy was a great lady," Lightfoot told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' after her death. "Men were drawn to her, and she used to make me jealous. But I don't have a bad thing to say about her." Smith later became notorious as the person who injected [[John Belushi]] with a fatal [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]].<ref>{{cite web|website=The Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/article-mystery-woman-admitted-i-killed-john-belushi/|title=Cathy Smith, who admitted to killing John Belushi, was a woman of mystery|first=Brad|last=Wheeler|date=August 26, 2020|accessdate=May 23, 2022}}</ref>

To stay in shape to meet the demands of touring and public performing, Lightfoot worked out in a gym six days per week, but declared in 2012 that he was "fully prepared to go whenever I'm taken." He calmly stated, "I've been almost dead a couple times, once almost for real ... I have more incentive to continue now because I feel I'm on borrowed time, in terms of age."<ref name="thespec1">{{cite web|url = http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2197822-gordon-lightfoot-making-the-best-use-of-borrowed-time-/|title = Gordon Lightfoot making the best use of 'borrowed time'|publisher = Thespec.com|date = April 24, 2012|access-date = April 19, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140315191051/http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2197822-gordon-lightfoot-making-the-best-use-of-borrowed-time-/|archive-date = March 15, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Lightfoot was a long-time resident of [[Toronto]] having settled in the [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]] neighbourhood in the 1970s, which once hosted an infamous after-party following a [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] date on [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] tour.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lightfoot, Dylan and the wild Rosedale party|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/2017/09/30/lightfoot-dylan-and-the-wild-rosedale-party.html|access-date=May 5, 2023|website=Toronto Star|date=September 30, 2017 }}</ref> In 1999, he purchased his final home in the [[Bridle Path, Toronto|Bridle Path]] neighbourhood,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bridle Path Mansions|url=https://nationalpost.com/life/homes/bridle-path-mansions-toronto-celebrities-real-estate|access-date=May 5, 2023|website=National Post}}</ref> where he would eventually live across the street from fellow musician [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] who purchased property in the mid-2010s,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gordon Lightfoot on Drake as Bridle Path neighbour; 'It'll be good to have him drop by'|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2016/08/04/gordon-lightfoot-says-drake-as-bridle-path-neighbour-itll-be-good-to-have-him-drop-by.html|access-date=May 5, 2023|website=Toronto Star|date=August 4, 2016 }}</ref> and at various times down the street from both [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Bridle Path's Celebrity History Of Luxury Real Estate|url=https://storeys.com/the-bridle-paths-celebrity-history-of-luxury-real-estate/|access-date=May 5, 2023|website=Storeys|date=December 10, 2019 }}</ref>

Lightfoot was celebrated in song by fellow Canadians The Guess Who on their 1968 album "Wheatfield Soul" with the track "Lightfoot." The opening verse mentions John Stockfish and Red Shea leaving no doubt about the identity of this Lightfoot who "is an artist painting Sistine masterpieces." The track also cleverly interjects titles of some of Gordon's songs in a line of its<ref>{{cite web | url=https://lyrics.lyricfind.com/lyrics/the-guess-who-lightfoot | title=Lyrics &#124; the Guess Who &#124; Lightfoot }}</ref> lyrics, as shown in single quotes.

'''Ingram Cecil Connor III''' (November 5, 1946 – September 19, 1973), known professionally as '''Gram Parsons''', was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist. He recorded as a solo artist and with the [[International Submarine Band]], [[the Byrds]], and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], popularizing what he called "Cosmic American Music", a hybrid of [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]], [[American folk music|folk]], and [[rock music|rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1217687|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gram Parsons Archive, Vol. 1: Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969 review|last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=Allmusic |access-date=21 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Schinder|first1=Scott|last2=Schwartz|first2=Andy|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever|url=https://archive.org/details/iconsofrockencyc0000schi|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/iconsofrockencyc0000schi/page/274 274]}}</ref>

Parsons was born in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], and developed an interest in country music while attending [[Harvard University]]. He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966, but the group disbanded prior to the 1968 release of its debut album, ''[[Safe at Home]]''. Parsons joined the Byrds in early 1968 and played a pivotal role in the making of the ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' album, a pioneering [[country rock]] album and a seminal [[progressive country]] recording.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article220248025.html |title= Marty Stuart thankful opening for Chris Stapleton, 'the man carrying the flag for country music'|last=Tunis|first=Walter |date=October 22, 2018|work=Lexington Herald-Leader |access-date=2023-07-23}}</ref> After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd [[Chris Hillman]] formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969; the band released its debut, ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'', the same year. The album was well received critically but failed commercially. After a sloppy cross-country tour, the band hastily recorded ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]''. Parsons was fired from the band before the album's release in early 1970.  Parsons spent the first half of 1971 with [[Keith Richards]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], living in his French villa [[Nellcôte]] during the recording sessions for ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', though he contributed very little to the recording process itself.  After traveling around Britain with friends in late 1971, he was treated for [[heroin]] addiction and returned to the U.S., where he was introduced to [[Emmylou Harris]], who assisted him on vocals for his first solo record, ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'', released in 1973. Although the record received enthusiastic reviews, it failed to chart.  His health deteriorated due to several years of drug abuse, foreshadowing his death from a [[drug overdose|toxic combination]] of morphine and alcohol in 1973 at the age of 26.  A posthumous solo album, ''[[Grievous Angel]]'', peaked at number 195 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart.

Parsons's relatively short career was described by [[AllMusic]] as "enormously influential" for country and rock, "blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other."<ref name="Allmusic Parsons">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5109|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gram Parsons Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|work=Allmusic|access-date=21 March 2010}}</ref> He has been credited with helping to found the [[country rock]] and [[alt-country]] genres. His posthumous honors include the [[Americana Music Association]] "President's Award" for 2003 and a ranking at No.&nbsp;87 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time."{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2005}}

==Life and career==
===Early years (1946–1966)===
Ingram Cecil Connor III was born on November 5, 1946, in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], to Ingram Cecil "Coon Dog" (1917–1958) and Avis (née Snively) Connor (1923–1965).{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}} The Connors normally resided at their main residence in [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], but Avis returned to her hometown in Florida to give birth.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}} She was the daughter of citrus fruit magnate [[John A. Snively]], who held extensive properties in Winter Haven and in Waycross. Gram's father, Ingram Connor II was a famous [[World War II]] [[flying ace]], decorated with the [[Air Medal]], who was present at the 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=7}} Biographer David Meyer characterized these parents as loving; he wrote in ''Twenty Thousand Roads'' that they are "remembered as affectionate parents and a loving couple".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}}

However, he also notes that "unhappiness was eating away at the Connor family": Avis suffered from depression, and both parents were [[alcoholic]]s.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=37}} Ingram Connor II died by suicide two days before Christmas in 1958, devastating the 12-year-old Gram and his younger sister, also named Avis.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=37-49}} Avis, Gram's mother, subsequently married Robert Parsons, who adopted Gram and his sister; they took his surname.

Gram Parsons briefly attended the prestigious [[Bolles School]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], before transferring to the public [[Winter Haven High School]]; after failing his junior year, he returned to Bolles. For a time, the family found a stability of sorts. They were torn apart in early 1965, when Robert became embroiled in an [[extramarital sex|extramarital affair]] and Avis' heavy drinking led to her death from [[cirrhosis]] on June 5, 1965, the day of Gram's graduation from Bolles.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=139-143}}

As his family was disintegrating around him, Parsons developed strong musical interests, particularly after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] perform in concert on February 22, 1956, in Waycross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1956.html |title=Elvis Presley 1956 : The King of Rock 'n' Roll |website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au |access-date=2012-06-07}}</ref> Five years later, barely in his teens, he played in [[rock and roll]] cover bands such as the Pacers and the Legends, headlining in clubs owned by his stepfather in the Winter Haven/Polk County area. By the age of 16, he graduated to [[folk music]], and in 1963 he teamed up with his first professional outfit, the Shilohs, in [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. Heavily influenced by [[The Kingston Trio]] and [[The Journeymen]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Gram Parsons - The Early Years: 1960-1965 |publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles |url=http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp1.html |access-date=26 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126074029/http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp1.html |archive-date=26 January 2010}}</ref> the band played [[Hootenanny|hootenannies]], [[coffee house]]s and high school auditoriums; as Parsons was still enrolled in prep school, he performed with the group only in select engagements. Forays into New York City (where Parsons briefly lived with a female folk singer in a loft on Houston Street) included a performance at Florida's exhibition in the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] and regular appearances at the Café Rafio on [[Bleecker Street]] in [[Greenwich Village]] in the summer of 1964. Although [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] (an acquaintance of Shiloh George Wrigley) arranged an exploratory meeting with [[Albert Grossman]], the impresario balked at booking the group for a Christmas engagement at [[The Bitter End]] when he discovered that the Shilohs were still high school students.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GayYaHLGCWcC&q=shilo&pg=PA57|title=Hickory Wind: The Life and Times of Gram Parsons|first=Ben|last=Fong-Torres|date=15 September 1998|publisher=Macmillan|access-date=19 December 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780312194642|ref=none}}</ref> Following a recording session at the radio station of [[Bob Jones University]], the group reached a creative impasse amid the emergence of [[folk rock]] and dissolved in the spring of 1965.

Despite his middling grades and test scores, Parsons was admitted to [[Harvard University]]'s class of 1966 on the basis of a strong admissions essay (or, more likely, because his family was wealthy—his grandfather owned one-third of all the citrus orchards in Florida).{{Cn|date=October 2023|reason=We need a source for this speculation}} Although he claimed to have studied theology (an oblique reference to his close friendship with his residential tutor, [[Harvard Divinity School]] graduate student Jet Thomas) in subsequent interviews, Parsons seldom attended his general education courses before departing in early 1966 after one semester. He did not become seriously interested in [[country music]] until his time at Harvard, where he heard [[Merle Haggard]] for the first time.

=== The International Submarine Band (1966–1967) ===
{{Main article|International Submarine Band}}
In 1966, he and other musicians from the Boston folk scene formed a group called the [[International Submarine Band]]. After briefly residing in the [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] section of [[the Bronx]], they relocated to [[Los Angeles]] the following year. Following several lineup changes, the band signed to [[Lee Hazlewood]]'s [[LHI Records]], where they spent late 1967 recording ''[[Safe at Home]]''. The album contains one of Parsons' best-known songs, "Luxury Liner," and an early version of "Do You Know How It Feels," which he revised later in his career. ''Safe at Home'' would remain unreleased until mid-1968, by which time the International Submarine Band had broken up.

The International Submarine Band appeared in the [[Peter Fonda]] film [[The Trip (1967 film)|''The Trip'']] (1967) as a performing band in one of the clubs. Their song "Lazy Days" was offered for the film's soundtrack, however the soundtrack was later done by Mike Bloomfield's [[The Electric Flag|Electric Flag]]. In 1967, Peter Fonda had befriended Parsons through actor Brandon de Wilde.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |date=May 24, 2020 |title=Peter Fonda, Rock's Easy Rider |url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/wordpress/peter-fonda-rocks-easy-rider/ |access-date=December 12, 2023 |website=Wordpress}}</ref> During this time, Fonda had recorded a version of the Parsons' song "November Nights" titled "November Night", dropping the 's'. The song was released as a single in March 1967, featuring "November Night" on the A-Side with the B-Side being a version of Donovan's "[[Catch the Wind]]".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Peter Fonda – November Night, Mar 1967 |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/3756169-Peter-Fonda-November-Night |access-date=December 12, 2023 |website=Discogs}}</ref>

===The Byrds (1968)===
{{Main article|The Byrds}}
By 1968, Parsons had come to the attention of [[the Byrds]]' [[bassist]], [[Chris Hillman]], via business manager Larry Spector as a possible replacement band member following the departures of [[David Crosby]] and [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] from the group in late 1967.<ref name="timeless">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=250–253|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Byrds Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3810|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=25 March 2010}}</ref> Parsons had been acquainted with Hillman since the pair had met in a bank during 1967 and in February 1968 he passed an audition for the band, being initially recruited as a [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]] but soon switching to [[rhythm guitar]] and vocals as well.<ref name="timeless"/><ref name="legacy">{{cite book|author=Fricke, David.|year=2003|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo: Legacy Edition (2003 CD liner notes)}}</ref>

Although Parsons was an equal contributor to the band, he was not regarded as a full member of the Byrds by the band's [[record label]], [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="timeless2">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=253–256|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> Consequently, when the Byrds' recording contract was renewed on February 29, 1968, it was only original members [[Roger McGuinn]] and Chris Hillman who signed it.<ref name="timeless2"/> Parsons, like fellow new recruit [[Kevin Kelley (musician)|Kevin Kelley]], was hired as a [[sideman]] and received a salary from McGuinn and Hillman.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=159|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> In later years, this led Hillman to state, "Gram was hired. He was not a member of the Byrds, ever. He was on salary; that was the only way we could get him to turn up."<ref>{{cite book|author=Scoppa, Bud.|year=2001|title=Sacred Hearts Fallen Angels (2001 CD liner notes)}}</ref> However, these comments overlook the fact that Parsons, like Kelley, was given equal billing alongside McGuinn, Hillman, and Kelley on the ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' album and in contemporary press coverage of the band.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=168–193|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref>

{{quote box|width=22em|"Being with The Byrds confused me a little. I couldn't find my place. I didn't have enough say-so. I really wasn't one of The Byrds.

And [Roger McGuinn] being a very perceptive fellow saw that it would help the act, and he started sticking me out front."|—Gram Parsons reflecting on his time with the Byrds<ref>{{Citation|author=Jacoba Atlas|author-link=Jacoba Atlas|newspaper=[[Melody Maker]]|title=Gram Parsons|location=London|date=25 July 1970}}</ref>}}

''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' was originally conceived by band leader Roger McGuinn as a sprawling, [[double album]] history of [[American popular music]].<ref name="fricke">{{cite book|author=Fricke, David.|year=1997|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1997 CD liner notes)}}</ref> It was to begin with [[bluegrass music]], then move through [[Country music|country and western]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock music]], before finally ending with the most advanced (for the time) form of [[electronic music]].<ref name="legacy"/> However, as recording plans were made, Parsons exerted a controlling influence over the group, persuading the other members to leave Los Angeles and record the album in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="timeless2"/> Along the way, McGuinn's original album concept was jettisoned in favor of a fully fledged country project, which included Parsons' songs such as "One Hundred Years from Now" and "[[Hickory Wind]]", along with compositions by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Woody Guthrie]], Merle Haggard, and others.{{sfn|Byrd Watcher1}}

Recording sessions for ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' commenced at Columbia Records' recording studios in the [[Music Row]] area of Nashville on March 9, 1968.<ref name="legacy"/> Midway through, the sessions moved to Columbia Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles.

While in England with the Byrds in the summer of 1968, Parsons left the band due to his concerns over a planned concert tour of South Africa, and after speaking to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards about the tour, he cited opposition to that country's [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] policies.<ref name="legacy"/> There has been some doubt expressed by Hillman over the sincerity of Parsons' protest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=262–263|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> It appears that Parsons was mostly apolitical, although he did refer to one of the younger African-American butlers in the Connor household as being "like a brother" to him in an interview.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} During this period Parsons became acquainted with [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] of [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gram Parsons and The Byrds: 1968|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp3.html|access-date=25 March 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028025309/http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp3.html|archive-date=28 October 2010}}</ref> Before Parsons' departure from the Byrds, he had accompanied the two Rolling Stones to [[Stonehenge]] (along with McGuinn and Hillman) in the English county of [[Wiltshire]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=259|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> Immediately after leaving the band, Parsons stayed at Richards' house and the pair developed a close friendship over the next few years, with Parsons reintroducing the guitarist to country music.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=179|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> According to Stones' confidant and close friend of Parsons, Phil Kaufman, the two would sit around for hours playing obscure country records and trading off on various songs with their guitars.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kaufman, Phil.|author2=White, Colin|pages=89–91|year=1993|title=Road Manager Deluxe|publisher=White Boucke Publishing|isbn=0-9625006-5-8}}</ref>

===The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969–1970)===
{{Main articles|The Flying Burrito Brothers}}
[[File:Country Music Hall of Fame (5981921715).jpg|thumb| Parsons's ''[[Nudie suit]]'' in the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in Nashville]]
Returning to Los Angeles, Parsons sought out Hillman, and the two formed [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] with bassist [[Chris Ethridge]] and [[pedal steel]] player [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]]. Their 1969 album ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'' marked the culmination of Parsons' post-1966 musical vision: a modernized variant of the [[Bakersfield sound]] that was popularized by [[Buck Owens]] amalgamated with strands of soul and [[psychedelic rock]]. The band appeared on the album cover wearing [[Nudie Cohn|Nudie]] suits emblazoned with all sorts of hippie accoutrements, including [[marijuana]], [[Tuinal]], and [[Seconal]]-inspired patches on Parsons' suit.<ref name="Grdn">{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=John |title=Naked talent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/feb/28/popandrock.gramparsons |access-date=24 August 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=28 February 2004}}</ref> Along with the Parsons-Hillman originals "Christine's Tune" and "Sin City" were versions of the [[soul music]] classics "[[The Dark End of the Street]]" and "Do Right Woman", the latter featuring David Crosby on high harmony. The album's original songs were the result of a very productive songwriting partnership between Parsons and Hillman, who were sharing a bachelor pad in the [[San Fernando Valley]] during this period. The atypically pronounced (for Parsons) gospel-soul influence on this album likely evolved from the ecumenical tastes of bassist Chris Ethridge (who co-wrote "Hot Burrito No. 1 [I'm Your Toy]" and "Hot Burrito No. 2" with Parsons) and frequent jamming with [[Delaney & Bonnie]] and Richards during the album's gestation.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Original drummer [[Eddie Hoh]] (best known for his work with [[The Monkees]] and [[Al Kooper]]) proved to be unable to perform adequate takes due to a substance abuse problem and was dismissed after two songs, leading the group to record the remainder of the album with a variety of session drummers, including former International Submarine Band drummer Jon Corneal (who briefly joined the group as an official member, appearing on a plurality of the tracks) and Popeye Phillips of [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show]]. Before commencing live performances, the group ultimately settled upon original Byrds drummer Michael Clarke. Technically different in comparison to his predecessors{{according to whom|date=November 2021}}, Clarke's striking physical appearance proved to be the primary criterion in this decision; an associate of the band would later recall that "the Burritos had to be pretty" and "Corneal didn't fit" from that standpoint.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=313}}

While unsuccessful from a commercial standpoint, the album was measured by rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] as "an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact." Embarking on a cross-country tour via train, as Parsons suffered from periodic bouts of fear of flying, the group squandered most of their money in a perpetual poker game and received bewildered reactions in most cities. Parsons was frequently indulging in massive quantities of [[psilocybin]] and [[cocaine]], so his performances were erratic at best, while much of the band's repertoire consisted of vintage [[honky-tonk]] and soul standards with few originals. Perhaps the most successful appearance occurred in Philadelphia, where the group opened for the reconstituted Byrds. Midway through their set, Parsons joined the headline act and fronted his former group on renditions of "Hickory Wind" and "You Don't Miss Your Water". The other Burritos surfaced with the exception of Clarke, and the joint aggregation played several songs, including "[[Long Black Veil]]" and "Goin' Back".{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The Flying Burrito Brothers appeared at the [[Sky River Rock Festival]] near Sultan, Washington, at the end of August.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.humbead.com/skyriver/|title=The Sky River Rock Festival|date=December 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213002048/http://www.humbead.com/skyriver/|archive-date=2018-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://concertposterauction.com/detail.asp?id=6642|title=Sky River Rock Festival 1969 AOR Concert/Event Poster - Listing # 6642|date=December 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216031410/http://concertposterauction.com/detail.asp?id=6642|archive-date=2018-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/anybody-here-meet-gram-parsons.275850/|title=....Anybody here meet Gram Parsons?|website=Steve Hoffman Music Forums}}</ref>

After returning to Los Angeles, the group recorded "The Train Song", written during an increasingly infrequent songwriting session on the train and produced by 1950s R&B legends [[Larry Williams]] and [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]]. Despite a request from the Burritos that the remnants of their publicity budget be diverted to promotion of the single, it also flopped. During this period, Ethridge realized that he did not share Parsons' and Hillman's affinity for country music, precipitating his departure shortly thereafter. He was replaced by lead guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]], while Hillman reverted to bass.

By this time, Parsons's own [[recreational drug use|use of drugs]] had increased so much that new songs were rare and much of his time was diverted to partying with the Stones, who briefly relocated to America in the summer of 1969 to finish their forthcoming ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' album and prepare for an autumn cross-country tour, their first series of regular live engagements in over two years. As the Stones prepared to play the nation's largest basketball arenas and early stadium concerts, the Burritos played to dwindling nightclub audiences; on one occasion, Jagger had to beseech Parsons to fulfill an obligation to his group. As Parsons "became a trust-fund baby when he came of age," he was still receiving about $30,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=30%2C000&year1=196901&year2=201803|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|website=Data.bls.gov|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref> from his family trust during this period, "distinguishing him from his many hungry, hard-scrabble peers."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/literature/2012-11-04/story/gram-parsons-biography-well-done/|title=Gram Parsons Biography Well Done|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|access-date=6 January 2017}}</ref>

However, the singer's dedication to the Rolling Stones was rewarded when the Burrito Brothers were booked as one of the acts at the infamous [[Altamont Music Festival]]. Playing a short set including "Six Days on the Road" and "[[Bony Moronie]]," Parsons left on one of the final helicopters and attempted to seduce [[Michelle Phillips]]. "Six Days..." was included in ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'', a documentary of the event.

With mounting debt incurred, A&M hoped to recoup some of their losses by marketing the Burritos as a straight country group. To this end, manager Jim Dickson instigated a loose session where the band recorded several honky tonk staples from their live act, contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein ("[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]", "[[Lodi (Creedence Clearwater Revival song)|Lodi]]", "[[I Shall Be Released]]", "[[Honky Tonk Women]]"), and Larry Williams' "Bony Moronie." This was soon scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budget.

Faced with a dearth of new material, most of the album was hastily written in the studio by Leadon, Hillman, and Parsons, with two ''Gilded Palace of Sin'' outtakes thrown into the mix. The resulting album, entitled ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]'', was released in April 1970. Although it is considered less inspired than its predecessor, it is notable for the Parsons-Hillman-Leadon song "Older Guys" and for its take on Jagger and Richards' "Wild Horses", the first recording released of this famous song. Parsons was inspired to cover the song after hearing an advance tape of the ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' track sent to Kleinow, who was scheduled to overdub a pedal steel part; although Kleinow's part was not included on the released Rolling Stones version, it is available on bootlegs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ5KTXbXoJo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/KJ5KTXbXoJo| archive-date=2021-11-09 | url-status=live|title=The Rolling Stones: Wild Horses (Alternate Sticky Fingers Version with Gram Parsons)|last=entarctica|date=9 May 2011|access-date=19 December 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Ultimately—and to the chagrin of Hillman, who was not keen on the song amid the band's creative malaise—Jagger and Richards consented to the [[cover version]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSy9OPq-XD0C&q=wild+horses+burrito+brothers&pg=PP112|title=Flying Burrito Brothers' The Gilded Palace of Sin|first=Bob|last=Proehl|date=15 December 2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|access-date=19 December 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781441143495}}</ref>

Like its predecessor, ''Burrito Deluxe'' underperformed commercially but also failed to carry the critical cachet of the debut. Disenchanted with the band, Parsons left the Burritos in mutual agreement with Hillman, who was long fatigued by his friend's unprofessionalism. Under Hillman's direction, the group recorded one more studio album before dissolving in the autumn of 1971.

In a recent interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'' Chris Hillman explained that "[t]he greatest legacy of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Gram is we were the alternative country band. We couldn't get on country radio and we couldn't get on rock radio! We were the outlaw country band for a brief period."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/|title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=4 June 2012}}</ref>

===Solo career and touring with Emmylou Harris (1970–1973)===
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2019}}
Parsons signed a solo deal with A&M Records and moved in with producer [[Terry Melcher]] in early 1970.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=337-342}} Melcher, who had worked with the Byrds and [[the Beach Boys]], was a member of the successful duo [[Bruce & Terry]], also known as [[The Rip Chords]]. The two shared a mutual penchant for cocaine and heroin, and as a result, the sessions were largely unproductive, with Parsons eventually losing interest in the project. "Terry loved Gram and wanted to produce him ... But neither of them could get anything done," recalled writer and mutual friend [[Eve Babitz]].{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340}} "Long lost, the tapes from this session have gathered a legendary patina," writes David Meyer.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=341}} The recording stalled, and the master tapes were checked out, but there is conflict as to whether "Gram ... or Melcher took them".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340-341}}

He then accompanied the Rolling Stones on their [[The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971|1971 U.K. tour]] in the hope of being signed to the newly formed [[Rolling Stones Records]]; by this juncture, Parsons and Richards had mulled the possibility of recording a duo album. Moving into [[Villa Nellcôte]] with the guitarist during the sessions for ''[[Exile on Main St.|Exile on Main Street]]'' that commenced thereafter, Parsons remained in a consistently incapacitated state and frequently quarreled with his girlfriend, aspiring actress Gretchen Burrell. Eventually, Parsons was asked to leave by [[Anita Pallenberg]], Richards' longtime domestic partner. Decades later, Richards suggested in his memoir that Jagger may have been the impetus for Parsons' departure because Richards was spending so much time playing music with Parsons. Rumors have persisted that he appears somewhere on the legendary album, and while Richards concedes that it is very likely he is among the chorus of singers on "Sweet Virginia", this has never been substantiated. Parsons attempted to rekindle his relationship with the band on their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American tour]] to no avail.

He returned to the US for a one-off concert with the Burritos, and at Hillman's request went to hear [[Emmylou Harris]] sing in a small club in [[Washington, D.C.]] They befriended each other and, within a year, he asked her to join him in Los Angeles for another attempt to record his first solo album. It came as a surprise to many when Parsons was enthusiastically signed to [[Reprise Records]] by [[Mo Ostin]] in mid-1972. The ensuing ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'' (1973) featured several members of [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[TCB Band]], led by lead guitarist [[James Burton]]. It included six new songs from a creatively revitalized Parsons alongside several country covers, including [[Tompall Glaser]]'s "[[Streets of Baltimore]]" and [[George Jones]]' "[[That's All It Took]]".

Parsons, by now featuring Harris as his duet partner, toured across the United States as Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels in February–March 1973. Unable to afford the services of the TCB Band for a month, the group featured the talents of Colorado-based rock guitarist [[Jock Bartley]] (soon to climb to fame with [[Firefall]]), veteran Nashville session musician [[Neil Flanz]] on pedal steel, eclectic bassist Kyle Tullis (best known for his work with [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Larry Coryell]]) and former [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] drummer [[N.D. Smart]]. The touring party also included Gretchen Parsons—by this point extremely envious of Harris—and Harris' young daughter. Coordinating the spectacle as road manager was [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]], who had served time with [[Charles Manson]] on [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]] in the mid-sixties and first met Parsons while working for the Stones in 1968. Kaufman ensured that the performer stayed away from substance abuse, limiting his [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake during shows and throwing out any drugs smuggled into hotel rooms. At first, the band was under-rehearsed and played poorly; however, they improved markedly with steady gigging and received rapturous responses at several leading countercultural venues, including [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in [[Austin, Texas]], [[Max's Kansas City]] in New York City, and [[Liberty Hall (Houston, Texas)|Liberty Hall]] in [[Houston, Texas]] (where [[Neil Young]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] sat in for a filmed performance). According to a number of sources, it was Harris who forced the band to practice and work up an actual set list. Nevertheless, the tour failed to galvanize sales of ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'', which never charted in the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/artists/gram+parsons|title=Artist Search for "gram parsons"|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=19 December 2017}}</ref>

For his next and final album, 1974's posthumously released ''[[Grievous Angel]]'', he again used Harris and members of the TCB Band for the sessions. The record generally received more enthusiastic reviews than its predecessor, ''[[GP (album)|GP]]''. Although Parsons only contributed two new songs to the album ("In My Hour of Darkness" and "Return of the Grievous Angel"), he was reportedly enthusiastic with his new sound and seemed to have finally adopted a diligent mindset to his musical career, limiting his intake of alcohol and opiates during most of the sessions.

Before recording, Parsons and Harris played a preliminary four-show mini-tour as the headline act in a June 1973 Warner Brothers country rock package with the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|New Kentucky Colonels]] and [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]]. A shared backing band included former Byrds lead guitarist and Kentucky Colonel [[Clarence White]], [[Pete Kleinow]], and [[Chris Ethridge]]. On July 15, 1973, White was killed by a drunk driver in [[Palmdale, California]], while loading equipment in his car for a concert with the New Kentucky Colonels.<ref>"Car kills Topanga musician", ''Long Beach (CA) Press-Telegram'', Monday, July 16, 1973, p. 13 (A Topanga musician loading instruments aboard his van was struck and killed Sunday...")</ref> At White's funeral, Parsons and [[Bernie Leadon]] launched into an impromptu touching rendition of "[[Farther Along (song)|Farther Along]]"; that evening, Parsons reportedly informed Phil Kaufman of his final wish: to be cremated in Joshua Tree. Despite the almost insurmountable setback, Parsons, Harris, and the other musicians decided to continue with plans for a fall tour.

In the summer of 1973, Parsons' [[Topanga Canyon]] home burned to the ground, the result of a stray cigarette. Nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the exception of a guitar and a prized [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] automobile. The fire proved to be the last straw in the relationship between Burrell and Parsons, who moved into a spare room in Kaufman's house. While not recording, he frequently hung out and jammed with members of New Jersey–based country rockers [[Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends]] and the [[proto-punk]] [[Jonathan Richman]] & the Modern Lovers, who were represented by former Byrds manager Eddie Tickner.

==Personal life==
In 1967, Nancy Ross gave birth to Gram's daughter [[Polly_Parsons_(producer)|Polly Parsons]].<ref name="latimes/2004-jul-08-wk-pop8">{{cite news |last1=Cromelin |first1=Richard |title=The heir to a parent |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-jul-08-wk-pop8-story.html |access-date=11 September 2023 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=8 July 2004}}</ref>

In 1971, after leaving the Stones' camp, Parsons married Gretchen Burrell (Gretchen Lisl Berrill Parsons Carpenter),<ref name="californiabirthindex/4567413">{{cite web |title=Gretchen Lisl Berrill born on May 15, 1952 in Los Angeles County, California. |url=https://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/gretchen_lisl_berrill_born_1952_4567413 |website=CaliforniaBirthIndex.org |access-date=11 September 2023}}<!-- https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/gretchen-burrell --></ref><ref name="tcmdb/0%7C208758">{{cite web |title=Gretchen Burrell |url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/0%7C208758/Gretchen-Burrell |website=[[tcmdb]] |publisher=[[tcm.com]] |access-date=11 September 2023 |language=en}}</ref> at his stepfather's New Orleans estate. Allegedly, the relationship was far from stable, with Burrell cutting a needy and jealous figure while Parsons quashed her burgeoning film career. Many of the singer's closest associates and friends claim that Parsons was preparing to commence divorce proceedings at the time of his death; the couple had already separated by this point.

Parsons and Burrell enjoyed the most idyllic time of their relationship in the second half of 1971, visiting old cohorts like Ian Dunlop and [[Family (band)|Family]]/[[Blind Faith]]/[[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] bassist [[Ric Grech]] in England. With the help of Grech and one of Grech's friends who also dabbled in country music and is now known as [[Hank Wangford]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Hank Wangford |publisher=The Gram Parsons Project |url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm |access-date=2011-11-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005060128/http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm |archive-date=2011-10-05}}</ref> Parsons eventually stopped using heroin; a previous treatment suggested by [[William Burroughs]] proved unsuccessful.

Before formally breaking up with Burrell, Parsons already had a woman waiting in the wings. While recording, he saw a photo of a beautiful woman at a friend's home and was instantly smitten. The woman in the photo was Margaret Fisher, a high school sweetheart of the singer from his [[Waycross, Georgia]], days. Like Parsons, Fisher had drifted west and became established in the Bay Area rock scene. A meeting was arranged and the two instantly rekindled their relationship, with Fisher dividing her weeks between Los Angeles and San Francisco at Parsons' expense.

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Gram Parsons}}
In the late 1960s, Parsons became enamored of and began to vacation at [[Joshua Tree National Park]] (then a [[National Monument]]) in southeastern California, where he frequently used [[psychedelics]] and reportedly experienced several [[UFO sightings]]. After splitting from Burrell, Parsons often spent his weekends in the area with Margaret Fisher and Phil Kaufman, with whom he had been living. Scheduled to resume touring in October 1973, Parsons decided to go on another recuperative excursion on September 17. Accompanying him were Fisher, personal assistant Michael Martin, and Martin's girlfriend Dale McElroy. Kaufman later said that Parsons' attorney was preparing divorce papers to serve to Burrell while Parsons remained in Joshua Tree on September 20.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=416}}

During the trip, Parsons often retreated to the desert, while the group visited bars in the nearby hamlet of [[Yucca Valley, California|Yucca Valley]] on both nights of their stay. Parsons consumed large amounts of alcohol and [[barbiturate]]s. On September 18, Martin drove back to Los Angeles to resupply the group with marijuana. That night, after challenging Fisher and McElroy to drink with him (Fisher disliked alcohol and McElroy was recovering from a bout of hepatitis), he said, "I'll drink for the three of us," and proceeded to drink six double tequilas. They then returned to the Joshua Tree Inn, where Parsons purchased [[morphine]] from an unknown young woman. After being injected by her in room #1, he overdosed. Fisher gave Parsons an ice-cube [[suppository]], and later, a cold shower. Instead of moving Parsons around the room, she put him to bed in room #8 and went out to buy [[coffee]] in the hope of reviving him, leaving McElroy to stand guard. As his respirations became irregular and later ceased, McElroy attempted [[CPR|resuscitation]]. Her efforts failed and Fisher, watching from outside, was visibly alarmed. After further failed attempts, they decided to call an ambulance. Parsons was declared dead on arrival at Yucca Valley Hospital at 12:15&nbsp;a.m. on September 19, 1973, in Yucca Valley. The official cause of death was an overdose of morphine and alcohol.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtpkCgAAQBAJ&q=%22discovering+that+parsons+had+overdosed%22&pg=PA66|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|first=Jeremy|last=Simmonds|page=66|edition=2nd|date=2012|publisher=Chicago Review Press|access-date=14 April 2020|via=Google Books|isbn=9781556527548}}</ref><ref name="dope">[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_014.html "What's up with the strange end of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328235408/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_014.html |date=March 28, 2008 }}, ''[[The Straight Dope]]''; accessed September 24, 2017.</ref>

According to Fisher in the 2005 biography ''Grievous Angel: An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons,'' the amount of morphine consumed by Parsons would be lethal to three regular users. [[Keith Richards]] stated in the 2004 [[documentary film]] ''Fallen Angel'' that Parsons understood the danger of combining opiates and alcohol and should have been more cautious. Upon Parsons' death, Fisher and McElroy were returned to Los Angeles by Kaufman, who dispersed the remnants of Parsons' drugs in the desert.

Before his death, Parsons said he wanted his body cremated at Joshua Tree and his ashes spread over Cap Rock, a prominent natural feature there. However, Parsons' stepfather Bob organized a private ceremony back in New Orleans and neglected to invite any of his friends from the music industry.<ref name="dope"/> Two accounts state that Bob Parsons stood to inherit Gram's share of his grandfather's estate if he could prove that Gram was a resident of Louisiana, explaining his eagerness to have him buried there.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Strange Death of Gram Parsons: 1973 |publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles |url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/memgrp6.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420141112/http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp6.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 April 1999 |access-date=25 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/ |title=Gram Parsons Project, interview with Phil Kaufman |website=Gramparsonsproject.com |access-date=2012-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303043252/http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/ |archive-date=2012-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Gram Parsons Memorial.jpg|thumb|Parsons' makeshift memorial in [[Joshua Tree, California]]]]
To fulfill Parsons' funeral wishes, Kaufman and a friend stole his body from [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and in a borrowed hearse, they drove it to Joshua Tree. Upon reaching the Cap Rock section of the park, they attempted to cremate Parsons' body by pouring five gallons of gasoline into the open coffin and throwing a lit match inside; what resulted was an enormous fireball.

The two were arrested several days later. Since there was no law against stealing a dead body, they were only fined $750{{sfn|Fong-Torres|1998|p=4}} for stealing the coffin and were not prosecuted for leaving {{convert|35|lb}} of his charred remains in the desert. What remained of Parsons' body was eventually buried in Garden of Memories Cemetery in Metairie, Louisiana.

The site of Parsons' cremation is today known as The Cap Rock Parking Lot. A local myth brings Parsons fans out to a large [[Glossary of climbing terms#F|rock flake]] known to [[rock climbing|rock climbers]] as ''The Gram Parsons Memorial Hand Traverse''. This myth was popularized when someone added a slab that marked Parsons' cremation to the memorial rock. The slab has since been removed by the U.S. National Park Service, and relocated to the Joshua Tree Inn. There is no monument at Cap Rock noting Parsons' cremation at the site.<ref name="billboard">[[Billboard Magazine]] article: "[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/79020/park-service-mulls-gram-parsons-memorial Park Service Mulls Gram Parsons Memorial].</ref> Joshua Tree park guides are given the option to tell the story of Parsons' cremation during tours, but there is no mention of the act in official maps or brochures.<ref name="billboard" /> Fans regularly assemble simple rock structures and writings on the rock, which the Park Service periodically removes.<ref name="billboard" />

==Legacy==
[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] describes Parsons as "enormously influential" for both country and rock, "blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other. ... His influence could still be heard well into the next millennium."<ref name="Allmusic Parsons"/> In his 2005 essay on Parsons for ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artist" list]], [[Keith Richards]] notes that Parsons' recorded music output was "pretty minimal." Nevertheless, Richards claims that Parsons' "effect on country music is enormous" and adds that this is "why we're talking about him now."{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2005|}}

In 2003 the [[Americana_Music_Honors_%26_Awards|Americana Music Awards]] awarded the late Gram Parsons with the [[Americana_Music_Honors_%26_Awards#President's_Award|President’s Award]], accepted by his daughter [[Polly_Parsons_(producer)|Polly Parsons]]. “My father wanted more than anything to be accepted by Nashville, and tonight he is,” she said. “I’m sure he and Johnny [Cash] are kicking it off right now.”<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/cash-takes-top-americana-honors-68986/ |title=Cash Takes Top Americana Honors |date=July 8, 2004 |newspaper=LA Times}}</ref>

The 2003 film ''[[Grand Theft Parsons]]'' stars [[Johnny Knoxville]] as [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]] and chronicles a farcical version of the theft of Parsons' corpse. In 2006, the Gandulf Hennig-directed documentary film titled ''Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel'' was released.

[[Emmylou Harris]] has continued to champion Parsons' work throughout her career, covering a number of his songs over the years, including "Hickory Wind", "Wheels", "Sin City", "Luxury Liner", and "Hot Burrito No.&nbsp;2". Harris's songs "[[Boulder to Birmingham]]", from her 1975 album ''[[Pieces of the Sky]]'', and "The Road", from her 2011 album ''[[Hard Bargain (Emmylou Harris album)|Hard Bargain]]'', are tributes to Parsons.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/emmylou-harris-pays-tribute-to-gram-parsons-on-new-album-20110607|title=Emmylou Harris Pays Tribute to Gram Parsons on New Album|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-date=December 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207203703/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/emmylou-harris-pays-tribute-to-gram-parsons-on-new-album-20110607|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In addition, her 1985 album ''[[The Ballad of Sally Rose]]'' is an original concept album that includes many allusions to Parsons in its narrative.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hurst|first1=Jack|title=More Than A Hint Emmylou Harris Comes Out In 'Ballad Of Sally Rose'|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1985/03/10/more-than-a-hint-emmylou-harris-comes-out-in-ballad-of-sally/|access-date=3 March 2017|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 March 1985}}</ref>  The song "My Man", written by [[Bernie Leadon]] and performed by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] on their album ''[[On the Border]]'', is a tribute to Gram Parsons.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Eagles – On the Border review|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6475|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=31 March 2010}}</ref> Both Leadon and Parsons were members of the Flying Burrito Brothers during the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Flying Burrito Brothers Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4284|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=31 March 2010}}</ref>

The 1973 album ''[[Crazy Eyes]]'' by [[Poco (band)|Poco]] pays homage to Parsons, as [[Richie Furay]] composed the title track in honor of him, and sings one of Parsons' own compositions, "Brass Buttons."  The album was released four days before Parsons died.

A music festival called Gram Fest or the Cosmic American Music Festival was held annually in honor of Parsons in Joshua Tree, California, between 1996 and 2006. The show featured tunes written by Gram Parsons and [[Gene Clark]] as well as influential songs and musical styles from other artists that were part of that era. Performers were also encouraged to showcase their own material. The underlying theme of the event is to inspire the performers to take these musical styles to the next level of the creative process. Past concerts have featured such notable artists as [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], [[Chris Ethridge]], [[Spooner Oldham]], [[John Molo]], Jack Royerton, [[Gib Guilbeau]], [[Counting Crows]], Bob Warford, [[Rosie Flores]], [[David Lowery (musician)|David Lowery]], [[Barry and Holly Tashian]], George Tomsco, [[Jann Browne]], [[Lucinda Williams]], Polly Parsons, The "Road Mangler" Phil Kaufman, [[Ben Fong-Torres]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[Mark Olson (musician)|Mark Olson]], and [[Sid Griffin]], as well as a variety of many other bands that had played over the two or three day event. In addition, the Gram Parsons Tribute, in Waycross, Georgia, is a music festival remembering Parsons in the town in which he grew up. Additional tributes spring up every year, the latest being the Southern California "Gram On!" celebration by The Rickenbastards in July, 2013, celebrating the life and legacy of a simple country boy with a dream, Gram Parsons.

In February 2008, Gram's protégée, [[Emmylou Harris]], was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. Despite his influence, however, Parsons has yet to be inducted. [[Radley Balko]] has written that "Parsons may be the most influential artist yet to be inducted to either the Rock and Roll or Country Music Hall(s) of Fame. And it's a damned shame."<ref>{{cite web|last=Balko|first=Radley|author-link=Radley Balko|title=Gram Parsons Night at The Basement. Plus: Put Gram in the Hall.

In 2004, Gram Parsons' daughter [[Polly_Parsons_(producer)|Polly Parsons]] produced two tribute concerts titled "Return to Sin City: A Tribute to Gram Parsons".

'''James Gregory Keelor''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|size=100%|OC}} (born '''Francis McIntyre'''; August 29, 1954) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. He is best known as a member of the band [[Blue Rodeo]], where he shares song writing and vocal duties with [[Jim Cuddy]]. Keelor has also released three solo albums and appeared as a guest musician on albums by [[Crash Vegas]] and [[Melissa McClelland]]. He participated, along with [[Rick White (musician)|Rick White]] and members of [[The Sadies]], in the supergroup [[The Unintended]].

==Early life==
Keelor was born Francis McIntyre in [[Inverness, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], Nova Scotia, on August 29, 1954.<ref name="maple">{{cite web|url=http://maplemusic.com/artists/gke/bio.asp|title=Bio – Greg Keelor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020225055927/http://maplemusic.com/artists/gke/bio.asp|access-date=August 30, 2018|archive-date=February 25, 2002}}</ref> Though he didn't know until adulthood, his birth parents had put him up for adoption. Keelor was adopted at age three and raised in [[Montréal]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/greg-keelor/|title=Greg Keelor|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>

Keelor attended [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]], and it was there that he befriended football teammate [[Jim Cuddy]] in 1971. After graduation, Keelor, Cuddy and a group of college friends, in search of adventure, traveled to Western Canada in a rundown old school bus. The bus broke down in [[Saskatchewan]], and Keelor somehow or another ended up in [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]] where he worked for a time. It was in Lake Louise that he learned to play the guitar and first considered a career as a musician.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

== Career ==
Keelor has been friends with [[Jim Cuddy]] since both attended [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]] high school. When they both had finished university, they decided to form a band which they called the Hi-Fi's, along with Jim Sublett on drums and Malcolm Schell playing bass. The band released a single in 1980 featuring "I Don't Know Why (You Love Me)" and on the B side "Look What You've Done". The record was not a big commercial success, though, and when they couldn't get a record deal in Toronto, they headed off to New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canuckistanmusic.com/index.php?maid=308|title=Review of Hi-Fi's I Don't Know Why (You Love Me)|website=canuckistanmusic.com|publisher=Canuckistan Music|last1=Panontin|first1=Michael|access-date=February 14, 2015}}</ref> A while after returning to Toronto from New York, Keelor and Cuddy formed Blue Rodeo.

Keelor is also a producer, having co-produced Blue Rodeo's ''[[Lost Together (Blue Rodeo album)|Lost Together]]'' and solo-producing [[Cuff the Duke]]'s albums ''[[Way Down Here]]'' and ''[[Morning Comes (album)|Morning Comes]]''.

Keelor also composed an original soundtrack for the 2010 Canadian Western comedy ''[[Gunless]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/blue_rodeo-better_off_as_we_are| title=Blue Rodeo- Better Off As We Are| work=Exclaim Magazine| access-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2000, Keelor and Blue Rodeo bandmate Jim Cuddy were the recipients of the National Achievement Award at the annual [[SOCAN]] Awards held in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2000-socan-awards |title=2000 Socan Awards &#124; Socan |access-date=August 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916155756/https://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2000-socan-awards |archive-date=September 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2013, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] along with [[Jim Cuddy]], "for their contributions to Canadian music and for their support of various charitable causes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15482&lan=eng|title=Governor General Announces 90 New Appointments to the Order of Canada|date=December 30, 2013}}</ref>

In 2018, he contributed the song "Unprovable" to the compilation album ''[[The Al Purdy Songbook]]''.<ref>[https://nowtoronto.com/music/features/al-purdy-songbook/ "Canadian poet Al Purdy inspires songs by Jason Collett, Sarah Harmer and more"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203084800/https://nowtoronto.com/music/features/al-purdy-songbook/ |date=February 3, 2019 }}.

'''James McMurtry''' (born March 18, 1962, in [[Fort Worth, Texas]])<ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4878}}</ref> is an American rock and folk rock/[[Americana (music)|americana]] singer, songwriter, guitarist, bandleader, and occasional actor (''[[Daisy Miller (film)|Daisy Miller]]'', ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'', and narrator of ''Ghost Town: 24 Hours in Terlingua''). He performs with veteran bandmates Daren Hess, Cornbread and Tim Holt.

His father, novelist [[Larry McMurtry]], gave him his first guitar at age seven. His mother, an English professor, taught him how to play it: "My mother taught me three chords and the rest I just stole as I went along. I learned everything by ear or by watching people."

==Biography==
McMurtry spent his first seven years in Ft. Worth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/2008/04/17/one-on-one-with-james-mcmurtry/ |title=One on One with James McMurtry |publisher=HoboTrashcan |date=2008-04-17 |access-date=2012-11-21}}</ref> but was raised mostly in [[Leesburg, Virginia]]. He attended the [[Woodberry Forest School]], [[Orange, Virginia]]. He began performing in his teens, writing bits and pieces.  He started performing his own songs at a downtown [[beer garden]] while studying English and Spanish at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. After traveling to [[Alaska]] and playing a few gigs, he returned to [[Texas]] and his father's  "little bitty ranch house crammed with 10,000 books". After a time, he left for [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], where he worked as a house painter, actor, bartender, and sometimes singer, performing at writers' nights and open-mic events.

In 1987, a friend in San Antonio suggested McMurtry enter the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk songwriter contest; he became one of six winners that year. Also around this time [[John Mellencamp]] was starring in a film based on a script by McMurtry's father, which gave McMurtry the opportunity to send a demo tape to Mellencamp. Mellencamp subsequently served as co-producer on McMurtry's debut album, ''[[Too Long in the Wasteland]]'' (1989). McMurtry also appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Falling from Grace (film)|Falling from Grace]]'', working with Mellencamp, [[John Prine]], [[Joe Ely]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]] in a "supergroup" called Buzzin' Cousins.

McMurtry released follow-up albums ''[[Candyland (James McMurtry album)|Candyland]]'' (1992) and ''Where'd You Hide the Body'' (1995). 1997 saw the release of "It Had to Happen" which included a cover of "[[Wild Man from Borneo (song)|Wild Man from Borneo]]" originally done by Kinky Friedman and "[[Sixty Acres]]"; a rollicking tune about a dead grandma and the events afterwards.

''Walk Between the Raindrops'' followed in 1998 and 2002 brought ''St. Mary of the Woods''. In April 2004, McMurtry released a tour album called ''Live in Aught-Three''. "[[Choctaw Bingo]]", one of McMurtry's most popular songs, is featured on both ''St. Mary of the Woods'' and ''Live in Aught-Three''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_spectator/2009/03/choctaw_bingo.html|author=Rosenbaum, Ron|title=Choctaw Bingo : A modest proposal for a new national anthem|journal=SLATE|date=13 March 2009|access-date=13 March 2009}}</ref>

In 2005, McMurtry released his first studio album in three years. ''[[Childish Things]]'' again received high critical praise, winning the song and album of the year at the 5th Annual [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Music Awards]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The album was perhaps McMurtry at his most political, as his working-class anthem "We Can't Make It Here" included direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]], the [[Iraq War]], and [[Wal-Mart]]. The music critic [[Robert Christgau]] ranked "We Can't Make It Here" as the best song of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |title=Rolling Stone Ballot: The 00's Best Songs & Albums |publisher=Robert Christgau |access-date=2012-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102174101/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/list/rs00.php |archive-date=2010-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

McMurtry released his follow-up album to ''[[Childish Things]]'' in April 2008. ''[[Just Us Kids]]'' continued with the previous album's political themes and included the song "Cheney's Toy," McMurtry's most direct criticism of [[George W. Bush]] so far. Like "We Can't Make It Here" from the previous album, "Cheney's Toy" was made available as a free Internet download.

McMurtry's ninth album, ''[[Complicated Game (album)|Complicated Game]]'' was released on February 24, 2015 on an L.A. record label also named Complicated Game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/11/04/james-mcmurtry-returns-with-howm-i-gonna-find-you-now-from-new-lp-exclusive/ |title=James McMurtry Returns With 'How'm I Gonna Find You Now' From New LP (Exclusive)|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=4 November 2014|publisher=The Wall St Journal |access-date=2014-11-07|last1=Danton|first1=Eric R.}}</ref> The album achieved critical acclaim, scoring 87 on Metacritic. Lead single "How’m I Gonna Find You Now" and other tracks such as album opener "Copper Canteen" have become staples in the McMurtry canon.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry tour statistics|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/james-mcmurtry-3bd798bc.html|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref>

''Cold and Bitter Tears: The Songs of Ted Hawkins'', released in late 2015 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, includes McMurtry's take on the late busker's song "Big Things". Additionally, ''Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay'', released in early 2016 (also on Eight 30 Records), features McMurtry's version of Finlay's "Comfort's Just a Rifle Shot Away."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dreamer-a-tribute-to-kent-finlay-mw0002916063 |title=Various Artists: Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay |work=AllMusic }}</ref>

McMurtry contributed his rendition of Adam Carroll's "Screen Door" to ''Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll'' (Eight 30 Records, 2016) as well as "Grandpa's Promise" to the satirical album ''Floater: A Tribute to the Tributes to Gary Floater'' (Eight 30 Records, 2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eight30records.com/|title=Eight 30 Records|website=Eight 30 Records|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref> Also in 2018 McMurtry performed at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.<ref>[https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ "41st Vancouver Folk Music Festival still true to tradition, still young at heart"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713225922/https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ |date=2019-07-13 }}. July 14, 2018 , ''Vancouver Weekly'', Paul Hecht and Elmira Kuznetsova</ref>

During restrictions on touring and live music imposed by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]], McMurtry started streaming several live acoustic performances a week on Facebook and YouTube. After using this platform to premiere new songs including "If It Don't Bleed", a new album, ''The Horses and the Hounds'', was announced on June 9, 2021 and released on August 20. Lead track "Canola Fields" was released to streaming services at the time of the announcement and would go on to get an Americana Music Award nomination. The album, produced by longtime collaborator Russ Hogarth and recorded at Jackson Browne's Santa Monica [[Groove Masters]] studio, was reviewed positively, scoring an 81 on Metacritic.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=James McMurtry Is Hung Up on the Details|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/james-mcmurtry-horses-and-the-hounds-album-1214772/|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Horses and the Hounds by James McMurtry|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/the-horses-and-the-hounds/james-mcmurtry|website=Metacritic}}</ref> Pitchfork reviewer [[Stephen Deusner]] said of the record: "McMurtry sounds more engaged here, more focused, and more generous to his hard-luck characters."<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Horses and the Hounds|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/james-mcmurtry-the-horses-and-the-hounds/}}</ref>

McMurtry lives in [[Lockhart, Texas]], 30 miles south of [[Austin, Texas]] where, until recently, he and The [[Heartless Bastards]] regularly played a midnight set at The Continental Club on Wednesday nights after [[Jon Dee Graham]], another Austin roots rock musician.<ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry Remains The Harbinger Of American Truth|url=https://glidemagazine.com/228503/james-mcmurtry-remains-the-harbinger-of-american-truth-interview/|website=Glide Magazine|date=11 July 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=James McMurtry releases new live EP to benefit Continental Club|url=https://www.statesman.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/09/02/james-mcmurtry-releases-new-live-ep-to-benefit-continental-club/42521801/|website=Austin American-Statesman}}</ref>

McMurtry's son, Curtis, is also a singer-songwriter and has performed with his father, as well as filling in for his father's Tuesday night solo residency at The Continental Club when James is on tour.

In 1951, Taylor and his family moved to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]],<ref name="nativeson">Susan Broili. "Native son coming to Carolina for tribute – Chapel Hill naming Morgan Creek bridge after James Taylor on April 26", ''The Chapel Hill Herald'' (Chapel Hill, NC), March 27, 2003, p. 1: "Even though Taylor was born in Boston on March 12, 1948, he moved to Chapel Hill when he was three and considers himself a North Carolinian."</ref> when Isaac took a job as an assistant professor of medicine at the [[University of North Carolina School of Medicine]].<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 55, 57.</ref> They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated.<ref name="white-61"/> Taylor later said, "Chapel Hill, the Piedmont, the outlying hills, were tranquil, rural, beautiful, but quiet. Thinking of the red soil, caused by local copper mining [Taylor's later song, "Copperline" was a nostalgic salute to that area where Taylor grew up], plus the seasons, the way things smelled down there, I feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people."<ref name="white-61">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 61.</ref> James attended a [[Public education|public]] primary school in Chapel Hill.<ref name="cby-428"/> Isaac's career prospered, but he was frequently away from home on [[military service]] at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] in [[Maryland]] or as part of [[Operation Deep Freeze]] in [[Antarctica]] in 1955 and 1956.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 68–69.</ref> Isaac Taylor later rose to become [[dean (education)|dean]] of the [[UNC School of Medicine]] from 1964 to 1971.<ref name="jtmuseum">[http://www.chapelhillmuseum.org/Exhibits/Ongoing/JamesTaylorExhibit/ "Carolina on my mind: The James Taylor story"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815074724/http://www.chapelhillmuseum.org/Exhibits/Ongoing/JamesTaylorExhibit/ |date=August 15, 2009 }}, exhibit at the Chapel Hill Museum, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Information retrieved December 24, 2007.</ref> Beginning in 1953, the Taylors spent summers on [[Martha's Vineyard]].<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 68.</ref>

Taylor took cello lessons as a child in [[North Carolina]], before learning the guitar in 1960.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 93, 98.</ref> His guitar style evolved, influenced by [[hymn]]s, [[carol (music)|carols]], and the music of [[Woody Guthrie]], and his technique derived from his [[bass clef]]-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: "My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were my left hand, and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand."<ref name="white-106">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 106–107.</ref>  Spending summer holidays with his family on [[Martha's Vineyard]], he met [[Danny Kortchmar]], an aspiring teenage guitarist from [[Larchmont, New York]].<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 102, 103.</ref> The two began listening to and playing [[blues]] and [[folk music]] together, and Kortchmar felt that Taylor's singing had a "natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that ''thing''."<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 105.</ref> Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly.<ref name="white-106"/> By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as "Jamie & Kootch".<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 111.</ref>

In 1961, Taylor went to [[Milton Academy]], a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory]] boarding school in Massachusetts. He faltered during his junior year, feeling uneasy in the high-pressure [[University-preparatory school#United States and Canada|college prep environment]] despite having a good scholastic performance.<ref name="white-112"/> The Milton headmaster later said, "James was more sensitive and less goal-oriented than most students of his day."<ref name="time-cover-story">{{cite magazine | url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,878920-1,00.html | archive-url=https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.time.com%2Ftime%2Fsubscriber%2Farticle%2F0%2C33009%2C878920-1%2C00.html#federation=archive.wikiwix.com&tab=url | archive-date=March 25, 2023 | title=James Taylor: One Man's Family of Rock | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=March 1, 1971 |url-status=live}}{{void|comment|link to archive of article as originally published: https://web.archive.org/web/20081221202826/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878920,00.html }}{{cbignore}}</ref> He returned home to North Carolina to finish out the semester at [[Chapel Hill High School (Chapel Hill, North Carolina)|Chapel Hill High School]].<ref name="white-112">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 111–112, 114.</ref> There he joined a band formed by his brother Alex called The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs), playing electric guitar; in 1964, they cut a single in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] that featured James's song "Cha Cha Blues" on the [[B-side]].<ref name="white-112"/> Having lost touch with his former school friends in North Carolina, Taylor returned to Milton for his senior year,<ref name="white-112"/> where he started applying to colleges to complete his education.<ref name="nytmag-71"/> But he felt part of a "life that [he was] unable to lead", and he became [[Major depressive disorder|depressed]]; he slept 20 hours each day, and his grades collapsed.<ref name="white-112"/><ref name="bg112601"/> In late 1965 he committed himself to [[McLean Hospital|McLean]], a psychiatric hospital in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]],<ref name="white-112"/> where he was treated with [[chlorpromazine]], and where the organized days began to give him a sense of time and structure.<ref name="time-cover-story"/><ref name="bg112601"/> As the [[Vietnam War]] escalated, Taylor received a psychological rejection from [[Selective Service System]] when he appeared before them with two white-suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative.<ref name="white-115"/> Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital's associated [[Arlington School]].<ref name="white-115">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 115.</ref> He later viewed his nine-month stay at McLean as "a lifesaver... like a pardon or like a reprieve",<ref name="bg112601">{{cite news | url = http://www.james-taylor.com/text/globe-1-2002.shtml | title = Shrink Wrapped Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll Were Regular Features of Life at McLean Psychiatric Hospital in Belmont | access-date = April 12, 2008 | date = November 26, 2001 | last = Beam | first = Alex | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | archive-date = April 20, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420190609/http://www.james-taylor.com/text/globe-1-2002.shtml | url-status = deviated | via = James Taylor Online }}</ref> and both his brother Livingston and his sister Kate later were patients and students there as well.<ref name="time-cover-story"/> As for his mental health struggles, Taylor thought of them as innate and said: "It's an inseparable part of my personality that I have these feelings."<ref name="nytmag-71">{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30916F73B5F127A93C3AB1789D85F458785F9 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013112717/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30916F73B5F127A93C3AB1789D85F458785F9 | archive-date=October 13, 2013 | access-date=March 26, 2023 | title=James Taylor, a New Troubadour | last=Braudy | first=Susan | author-link=Susan Braudy | magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=February 21, 1971}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Career==
===1966–1969: Early career===
At Kortchmar's urging, Taylor checked himself out of McLean and attended [[Elon University]] for a semester before he moved to New York City to form a band.<ref name="white-115"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Rocketman5000 |date=2021-05-01 |title=Inside the Rock Era: James Taylor, the #46 Artist of the Rock Era Part One |url=https://top5000-rocketman5000.blogspot.com/2021/03/james-taylor-43-artist-of-rock-era.html |access-date=2024-08-28 |website=Inside the Rock Era}}</ref> They recruited Joel O'Brien, formerly of Kortchmar's old band [[King Bees (band)|King Bees]] to play drums, and Taylor's childhood friend Zachary Wiesner (son of academic [[Jerome Wiesner]]) to play bass. After Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him, they called themselves the Flying Machine.<ref name="time-cover-story"/><ref name="white-116">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 116.</ref> They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean, such as "[[Knocking 'Round the Zoo]]", "Don't Talk Now", and "The Blues Is Just a Bad Dream".<ref name="bg112601"/><ref name="white-116"/> In some other songs, Taylor romanticized his life, but he was plagued by self-doubt.<ref name="nyt-palmer-1981"/> By summer 1966, they were performing regularly at the high-visibility Night Owl Cafe in [[Greenwich Village]], alongside acts such as [[the Turtles]] and [[Lothar and the Hand People]].<ref name="white-117">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 117.</ref>

Taylor associated with a motley group of people and began using heroin, to Kortchmar's dismay.<ref name="time-cover-story"/><ref name="white-117"/> In a late 1966 hasty recording session, the group cut a single, Taylor's "[[Night Owl (James Taylor song)|Night Owl]]", backed with his "Brighten Your Night with My Day".<ref name="white-118">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 118–119.</ref> Released on Rainy Day Records, distributed by [[Jubilee Records]], it received some radio airplay in the Northeast,<ref name="white-118"/> but only charted at {{numero|102}} nationally.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p00456.htm | title=James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine – 1967 | author=Dexter, Kerry | publisher=Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange | year=1997 | access-date=December 26, 2008 | archive-date=October 10, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010210837/http://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p00456.htm | url-status=live }}</ref> Other songs had been recorded during the same session, but Jubilee declined to go forward with an album.<ref name="white-118"/> After a series of poorly chosen appearances outside New York, culminating with a three-week stay at a failing nightspot in [[Freeport, Bahamas]] for which they were never paid, the Flying Machine broke up.<ref name="white-118"/> (A [[The Flying Machine (band)|UK band with the same name]] emerged in 1969 with the hit song "[[Smile a Little Smile for Me]]". The Flying Machine was briefly referenced in Taylor's song "[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]", and following his success as a solo artist, the band's recordings were later released in 1971 as ''[[James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine]]''.)

Taylor would later say of this New York period, "I learned a lot about music and too much about drugs."<ref name="nyt-palmer-1981">{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30611FB3A5D0C7B8CDDAD0894D9484D81 | title=Taylor: After the Turmoil and Wanderlust | author=[[Robert Palmer (American writer)|Palmer, Robert]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 8, 1981 | access-date=February 9, 2017 | archive-date=March 14, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220314172915/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/08/arts/the-pop-life-taylor-after-the-turmoil-and-wanderlust.html | url-status=live }}</ref> Indeed, his drug use had developed into full-blown [[heroin addiction]] during the final Flying Machine period: "I just fell into it, since it was as easy to get high in the Village as get a drink."<ref name="white-118"/> He hung out in [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]], playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out, letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment.<ref name="white-120">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 120–123.</ref> Finally out of money and abandoned by his manager, he made a desperate call one night to his father. Isaac Taylor flew to New York and staged a rescue, renting a car and driving all night back to North Carolina with James and his possessions.<ref name="white-120"/> Taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery; he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshly.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 126.</ref>

Taylor decided to try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: [[Notting Hill]], [[Belgravia]], and [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref name="white-128">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 127–129.</ref> After recording some demos in [[Soho]], his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for [[Peter and Gordon]]), to connect Taylor to [[Peter Asher]]. Asher was [[A&R]] head for the [[Beatles]]' newly formed label [[Apple Records]].<ref name="white-135">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 134–135.</ref> Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including "[[Something in the Way She Moves]]", to Asher,<ref name=Asher>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDliZ42yoFA&list=PL78DA37F91244192E&index=5 "James Taylor & Carole King: Live at the Troubadour"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210315165330/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDliZ42yoFA&list=PL78DA37F91244192E&index=5 |date=March 15, 2021 }}, 2007</ref> who then played the demo for Beatles [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]].

During the recording sessions, Taylor fell back into his drug habit by using heroin and [[methedrine]].<ref name="white-139"/> He underwent [[physeptone]] treatment in a British program, returned to New York and was hospitalized there, and then finally committed himself to the [[Austen Riggs Center]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders.<ref name="white-142">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 142–144.</ref> Meanwhile, Apple released his debut album, ''[[James Taylor (album)|James Taylor]]'', in December 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the US.<ref name="white-142"/> Critical reception was generally positive, including a complimentary review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' by [[Jon Landau]], who said that "this album is the coolest breath of fresh air I've inhaled in a good long while.

In July 1969, Taylor headlined a six-night<!--TODO need cite on this --> stand at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|the Troubadour]] in Los Angeles.

===1970–1972: Warner Bros. and career breakthrough===

Once he had recovered, Taylor moved to California, keeping Asher as his manager and record producer. In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Titled ''[[Sweet Baby James]]'', and featuring the participation of [[Carole King]], the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor's critical and popular breakthrough, buoyed by the single "[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]", a song about both Taylor's experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend Suzanne Schnerr. Both the album and the single reached {{numero|3}} on the ''Billboard'' charts, with ''Sweet Baby James'' selling more than 1.5&nbsp;million copies in its first year<ref name="time-cover-story"/> and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone. ''Sweet Baby James'' was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public, marking a direction he would take in following years. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It went on to be listed at {{numero|103}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] in 2003, with "Fire and Rain" listed as {{numero|227}} on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] in 2004.

During the time that ''Sweet Baby James'' was released, Taylor appeared with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]] in a [[Monte Hellman]] film, ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''. In October 1970, he performed with his then partner [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Phil Ochs]], and the Canadian band [[Chilliwack (band)|Chilliwack]] at a [[Vancouver]] benefit concert that funded [[Greenpeace]]'s protests of [[Amchitka#Milrow and Cannikin tests|1971 nuclear weapons tests]] by the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]] at [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]]; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as ''[[Amchitka (album)|Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace]]''. In January 1971, sessions for Taylor's next album began.

He appeared on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', singing "Sweet Baby James", "Fire and Rain", and "Country Road", on February 17, 1971. His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story of him as "the face of new rock".<ref name="time-cover-story"/> It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''{{'}} [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] and to ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', and said, "Taylor's use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music."<ref name="time-cover-story"/> One of the writers described his look as "a cowboy Jesus", to which Taylor later replied, "I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison."<ref>''CBS Early This Morning'', musician James Taylor, December 5, 2016</ref>
[[File:James Taylor Billboard 1971.jpg|left|thumb|293x293px|Taylor in a publicity photograph for his 1971 studio album ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'']]
Released in April 1971, ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'' also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, a version of Carole King's new "[[You've Got a Friend]]" (featuring backing vocals by [[Joni Mitchell]]), which reached {{numero|1}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, "[[Long Ago and Far Away (James Taylor song)|Long Ago and Far Away]]", also made the Top 40 and reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. The album itself reached {{numero|2}} on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, ''Before This World'', which went to {{numero|1}} superseding [[Taylor Swift]]. In early 1972, Taylor won his first Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]], for "You've Got a Friend"; King also won [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the same song in that ceremony. The album went on to sell 2.5&nbsp;million copies in the United States.

November 1972 heralded the release of Taylor's fourth album, ''[[One Man Dog]]''. A [[concept album]] primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured a cameo by [[Linda Ronstadt]] along with Carole King, Carly Simon, and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. Reception was generally lukewarm and, despite making the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Album Charts, its overall sales were disappointing. The lead single, "[[Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight]]", peaked at {{numero|14}} on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, "[[One Man Parade]]", barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]] on November 3, in a small ceremony at her [[Murray Hill, Manhattan]] apartment.<ref name="white-208">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 208.</ref> A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years.<ref name="white-208"/> They had two children, [[Sally Taylor (musician)|Sarah Maria "Sally" Taylor]], born January 7, 1974, and Benjamin Simon "Ben" Taylor, born January 22, 1977.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 216, 243.</ref> During their marriage, the couple would guest on each other's albums and have two hit singles as duet partners: a cover of Inez & Charlie Foxx's "[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)#1970s: Carly Simon and James Taylor|Mockingbird]]" and a version of The Everly Brothers' "[[Devoted to You (song)#Carly Simon and James Taylor version|Devoted to You]]".

===1973–1976: Continued success and ''Greatest Hits''===
Taylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. ''[[Walking Man]]'' was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and [[Linda McCartney]] and guitarist [[David Spinozza]]. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to appear on the Top 100.

[[File:James Taylor and Carly Simon, 1975.jpg|thumb|Taylor and Simon in concert, 1975]]
However, Taylor's artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album ''[[Gorilla (James Taylor album)|Gorilla]]'' reached {{numero|6}} and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a version of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)]]", featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached {{numero|5}} in America and {{numero|1}} in Canada. On the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feelgood "Mexico", featuring a guest appearance by [[Crosby & Nash]], also reached the Top 5 of that list. A well-received album, ''Gorilla'' showcased Taylor's electric, lighter side that was evident on ''Walking Man''. However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with songs such as "Mexico", "Wandering" and "Angry Blues". It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, "Sarah Maria".

''Gorilla'' was followed in 1976 by ''[[In the Pocket (James Taylor album)|In the Pocket]]'', Taylor's last studio album to be released under [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including [[Art Garfunkel]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Stevie Wonder]] (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single "[[Shower the People]]", an enduring song that hit {{numero|1}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and hit 22 on the Pop Charts. However, the album was not well received, reaching {{numero|16}} and being criticized, particularly by ''Rolling Stone''. Still, ''In The Pocket'' went on to be certified gold.

With the close of Taylor's contract with Warner, in November, the label released ''[[Greatest Hits (James Taylor album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. With time, it became his best-selling album ever. It was certified 11× Platinum in the US, earned a Diamond certification by the [[RIAA]], and eventually sold close to 20 million copies worldwide.

===1977–1981: Move to Columbia Records===
In 1977 Taylor signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. ''[[JT (album)|JT]]'', released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since ''Sweet Baby James'', earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Peter Herbst of ''Rolling Stone'' was particularly favorable to the album, of which he wrote in its August 11, 1977, issue, "''JT'' is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts. ... But it's nice to hear him sounding so healthy."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Herbst |first=Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jt-19770811 |title=James Taylor JT Album Review |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 11, 1977 |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-date=August 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828000231/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jt-19770811 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''JT'' reached {{numero|4}} on the ''Billboard'' charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the United States alone. The album's Triple Platinum status ties it with ''Sweet Baby James'' as Taylor's all-time biggest-selling studio album. It was propelled by [[Jimmy Jones (singer)|Jimmy Jones]]'s and [[Otis Blackwell]]'s "[[Handy Man (song)|Handy Man]]", which hit {{numero|1}} on ''Billboard'''s Adult Contemporary chart and reached {{numero|4}} on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles; the up-tempo pop "[[Your Smiling Face]]", an enduring live favorite, reached the American Top 20; however, "[[Honey Don't Leave L.A.]]", which [[Danny Kortchmar]] wrote and composed for Taylor, did not enjoy much success, reaching only {{numero|61}}.

Back in the forefront of popular music, Taylor guested with [[Paul Simon]] on Art Garfunkel's recording of [[Sam Cooke]]'s "[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]", which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped the [[CCM AC chart|AC charts]] in early 1978. After briefly working on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979, with the cover-studded Platinum album titled ''[[Flag (James Taylor album)|Flag]]'', featuring a Top 30 version of [[Gerry Goffin]]'s and Carole King's "[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]". (Two selections from ''Flag'', "[[Millworker]]" and "Brother Trucker" were featured on the PBS production of [[Working (musical)|the Broadway musical]] based on [[Studs Terkel]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do|Working]]'', which Terkel himself hosted. Taylor himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed "Brother Trucker" in character.) Taylor also appeared on the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy|No Nukes]] concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of "Mockingbird" with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the [[No Nukes (album)|''No Nukes'' album]] and [[No Nukes (film)|film]].

On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with [[Mark David Chapman]] who would [[Murder of John Lennon|murder John Lennon]] just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: "The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." The next night, Taylor, who lived in a building next-door to Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: "I heard him shoot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |title=Lennon's death: I was there – BBC News |work=BBC News |date=December 8, 2010 |access-date=June 17, 2015 |archive-date=April 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406123437/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11926898 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 1981, Taylor released the album ''[[Dad Loves His Work]]'' whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect that he and Simon had on each other.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 275–276.</ref> The album was another Platinum success, reaching {{numero|10}} and providing Taylor's final real hit single in a duet with [[JD Souther]], "[[Her Town Too]]", which reached {{numero|5}} on the Adult Contemporary chart and {{numero|11}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

===1981–1996: Troubled times and new beginnings===

Taylor had thoughts of retiring by the time he played the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in January 1985.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/sting/3799 | title=Sting and James Taylor get Rock in Rio off to a gentle start |author=[[Valeria Rossi|Rossi, Valeria]] |author2=[[:pt:Luciano Vianna|Vianna, Luciano]] |work=[[NME]] | date=January 13, 2001 | access-date=March 17, 2009 | archive-date=December 2, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202113706/http://www.nme.com/reviews/sting/3799 | url-status=live }}</ref> He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of [[Brazilian music]].<ref name="white-287">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', pp. 287–288.</ref> "I had ... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while", he recalled in 1995:

{{blockquote|I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track.<ref>"James Taylor: At home on the road", by Ron Thibodeaux, ''The Times-Picayune'', New Orleans, May 4, 1995.</ref>}}

The song "Only a Dream in Rio" was written in tribute to that night, with lines like "I was there that very day and my heart came back alive."<ref name="white-287"/> The October 1985 album, ''[[That's Why I'm Here]]'', from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer [[cover version|covers]], most notably the [[Buddy Holly]] song "[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]", released as a single reached {{numero|61}}. On the album track "Only One", the backing vocals were performed by an all-star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Taylor's next albums were partially successful; in 1988, he released ''[[Never Die Young]]'', highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum ''[[New Moon Shine]]'' provided Taylor some popular songs with "Copperline" and "(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' About That", both hit singles on Adult Contemporary radio. In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer [[amphitheater]] circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc ''[[Live (James Taylor album)|Live]]'' album captures this, with a highlight being [[Arnold McCuller]]'s [[descant]]s in the [[coda (music)|codas]] of "[[Shower the People]]" and "I Will Follow". He provided a guest voice to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Deep Space Homer]]", and also appeared later on in the series when the family put together a jigsaw puzzle with his face as the missing final piece. In 1995, Taylor performed the role of the Lord in ''[[Randy Newman's Faust]]''.

===1997–present: Current ventures===

==== 1997–2008 ====
[[File:JamesTaylor 02.jpg|thumb|Taylor in concert at DeVos Hall, Grand Rapids, Michigan – April 2006]]
In 1997, after six years since his last studio album, Taylor released ''[[Hourglass (James Taylor album)|Hourglass]]'', an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. "Jump Up Behind Me" paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 318.</ref> "Enough To Be on Your Way" was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade.<ref>White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 306.</ref> The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996.<ref name="White, p. 301">White, ''Long Ago and Far Away'', p. 301.</ref> ''Rolling Stone Magazine'' found that "one of the themes of this record is disbelief", while Taylor told the magazine that it was "spirituals for agnostics".<ref>"In 'Up From Your Life', you sing, "For an unbeliever like you/ There's not much they can do." In "Gaia", you call yourself a 'poor, wretched unbeliever'." Interview, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', June 24, 1997.</ref> Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and ''Hourglass'' was a commercial success, reaching {{numero|9}} on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on "Little More Time With You". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since ''JT'', when he was honored with [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Album]] in 1998.

Flanked by two greatest hit releases, Taylor's Platinum-certified ''[[October Road (album)|October Road]]'' appeared in 2002 to a receptive audience. It featured a number of quiet instrumental accompaniments and passages. Overall, it found Taylor in a more peaceful frame of mind; rather than facing a crisis now, Taylor said in an interview that "I thought I'd passed the midpoint of my life when I was 17."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/08/13/2002-08-13_taylor_s__road__to_happiness.html | title=Taylor's 'Road' to Happiness | first=David | last=Hinckley | newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] | date=August 13, 2002 | access-date=March 17, 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album appeared in two versions, a single-disc version and a "[[limited edition]]" two-disc version which contained three extra songs including a duet with [[Mark Knopfler]], "[[Sailing to Philadelphia]]", which also appeared on Knopfler's album by the same name. Also in 2002, Taylor teamed with bluegrass musician [[Alison Krauss]] in singing "[[The Boxer]]" at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] Tribute to [[Paul Simon]]. They later recorded the [[Louvin Brothers]] duet, "How's the World Treating You?" In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released ''[[James Taylor: A Christmas Album]]'' with distribution through [[Hallmark Cards]].

[[File:James Taylor at Tanglewood.jpg|thumb|240px|Taylor performing at Tanglewood in 2008]]
Always visibly active in [[Political ecology|environmental]] and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the [[Vote for Change]] tour playing a series of concerts in American [[swing states]]. These concerts were organized by [[MoveOn.org]] with the goal of mobilizing people to vote for [[John Kerry]] and against [[George W. Bush]] in that year's presidential campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the [[Dixie Chicks]].

Taylor performed "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at Game 2 of the [[World Series]] in Boston on October 24, 2004, on October 25, 2007, both the anthem and "America" for the game on October 24, 2013, and Game 1 on October 23, 2018. He also performed at Game 1 of the [[2008 NBA Finals]] in Boston on June 5, 2008, and at the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|NHL's Winter Classic]] game between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[Boston Bruins]].{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

In December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' entitled "[[A Change Is Gonna Come (The West Wing)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]". He sang [[Sam Cooke]]'s classic "[[A Change Is Gonna Come (song)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]" at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor's wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s ''Crossroads'' alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, [[MusiCares]] honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians. Before a performance by the Dixie Chicks, lead singer [[Natalie Maines]] acknowledged that he had always been one of their musical heroes and had, for them, lived up to their once-imagined reputation of him.<ref name="dxchicks">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKka3yYpBaE| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729161611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKka3yYpBaE| archive-date=July 29, 2013|title=Musicares Honoring James Taylor|last=Dixie Chicks|year=2006|work=Video of Stage Performance|publisher=Grammy Award Sponsored Musicares|access-date=December 31, 2008}}</ref> They performed his song, "Shower the People", with a surprise appearance by [[Arnold McCuller]], who has sung backing vocals on Taylor's live tours and albums for many years.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

In the fall of 2006, Taylor released a repackaged and slightly different version of his Hallmark Christmas album, now entitled ''James Taylor at Christmas'', and distributed by Columbia/Sony. In 2006, Taylor performed [[Randy Newman]]'s song "[[Our Town (Randy Newman song)|Our Town]]" for the [[Disney]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The song was nominated for the 2007 [[Academy Award]] for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the [[Times Union Center]] in [[Albany, New York]] honoring newly sworn in [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]].

Taylor's next album, ''[[One Man Band (James Taylor album)|One Man Band]]'' was released on CD and DVD in November 2007 on [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] Label, where he joined with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe called the One Man Band Tour, featuring some of Taylor's most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins—accompanied solely by the "one man band" of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, [[Larry Goldings]]. The [[Surround sound#5.1 Channel Surround (3-2 Stereo) (digital discrete: Dolby Digital, DTS, SDDS, Penteo)|digital discrete 5.1 surround sound]] mix of ''One Man Band'' won a [[TEC Awards|TEC Award]] for best surround sound recording in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/08winners.html |title=The 2008 TEC Awards Winners |publisher=Legacy.tecawards.org |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120303/http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/08winners.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:You've Got a Friend JT CK 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Taylor and [[Carole King]] performing "[[You've Got a Friend]]" together during their [[Troubadour Reunion Tour]] in 2010]]
On November 28–30, 2007, Taylor accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at the Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as [[Tom Waits]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Elton John]], performed early in their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank (a member of [[America's Second Harvest]], the nation's Food Bank Network). Parts of the performance shown on ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, "I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly". Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his ''One Man Band'' DVD and tour performances.

In December 2007, ''James Taylor at Christmas'' was nominated for a Grammy Award.  In January 2008, Taylor recorded approximately 20 songs by others for a new album with a band including [[Luis Conte]], [[Michael Landau]], [[Lou Marini]], [[Arnold McCuller]], [[Jimmy Johnson (bassist)|Jimmy Johnson]], [[David Lasley]], Walt Fowler, [[Andrea Zonn]], [[Kate Markowitz]], [[Steve Gadd]] and [[Larry Goldings]].

<blockquote>"It's pure escapism is all it is...I'm not the first one to do it, nor shall I probably be the last. But I think it's really a part of the human condition that you've got to have some fun. You've got to get away from whatever you do to make a living or other parts of life that stress you out. I try to make it at least 50/50 fun to work and so far it's worked out." -Jimmy Buffett<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://abc7.com/jimmy-buffett-dead-passed-away-death/13728459/ | title=Jimmy Buffett, 'Margaritaville' singer, dead at 76 | work=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] | date=September 2, 2023}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2020, The [[Associated Press]] described Buffett's sound as a "special [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] blend of country, [[pop music|pop]], [[American folk music|folk]] and rock, topped by Buffett's swaying voice.

Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he wrote himself. He had 33 albums and singles that were certified Gold and Platinum in the U.S by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/?s=JOHN+DENVER|title=John Denver |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America}}</ref> with estimated sales of more than 33 million units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://floridatheatre.com/event/john-denver-rocky-mountain-high-concert/ |title=John Denver, A Rocky Mountain High Concert |publisher=The Florida Theatre |date=November 19, 2013 |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619040301/http://floridatheatre.com/event/john-denver-rocky-mountain-high-concert/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, disdain for city life, enthusiasm for music, and relationship trials. Denver's music appeared on a variety of charts, including [[country music]], the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]], earning 12 [[Music recording certification|gold]] and four [[Music recording certification|platinum]] albums with his signature songs "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]"; "[[Poems, Prayers & Promises]]"; "[[Annie's Song]]"; "[[Rocky Mountain High]]"; "[[Calypso (John Denver song)|Calypso]]"; "[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]"; and "[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]".

Denver appeared in several films and television specials during the 1970s and 1980s, including the 1977 hit ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'', in which he starred alongside [[George Burns]]. He continued to record into the 1990s, also focusing on environmental issues as well as lending vocal support to space exploration and testifying in front of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to protest censorship in music.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stunda |first=Hilary |title=John Denver: An environmental legacy remembered |url=https://www.aspentimes.com/news/john-denver-an-environmental-legacy-remembered/ |access-date=January 30, 2023 |newspaper=The Aspen Times |date=October 7, 2011 |language=en-US}}</ref> Known for his love of Colorado, Denver lived in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] for much of his life. In 1974, Denver was named [[poet laureate]] of the state. The Colorado state legislature also adopted "Rocky Mountain High" as one of its two state songs in 2007, and [[West Virginia]] did the same for "Take Me Home, Country Roads" in 2014. An avid pilot, Denver was killed at age 53 in a single-fatality crash while piloting a recently purchased light plane in 1997.

==Early life==
Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. was born on December 31, 1943, in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], to Erma Louise (née Swope; 1922–2010) and Captain Henry John "Dutch" Deutschendorf Sr. (1920–1982),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/denver.html |title=Ancestry of John Denver compiled by William Addams Reitwiesner |publisher=Wargs.Com |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> a [[United States Army Air Forces]] pilot stationed at [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]]. Captain Deutschendorf Sr. was a decorated pilot who set a number of air speed records in a [[Convair B-58 Hustler]] in 1961.<ref name="father">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/henry-j-deutschendorf/ |title=12 January 1961 |date=January 12, 2023 |publisher=This Day in Aviation |access-date=October 12, 2023}}</ref>

In his 1994 autobiography ''Take Me Home'', Denver described his father as a stern man who could not show his love for his children. With a military father, Denver's family moved often, and he found difficulty gaining friends and assimilating with children of his own age. The introverted Denver often felt misplaced and did not know where he truly belonged.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7733036/John-Denver.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020459/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7733036/John-Denver.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 6, 2010 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=John Denver | date=October 14, 1997}}</ref> While stationed at [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], the Deutschendorfs purchased a home and lived there from 1951 to 1959.<ref>Pima County Recorders Office.  [https://www.recorder.pima.gov/RecorderHome Pima County Recorder's Website]</ref> Denver lived in Tucson from ages six to 14.<ref name=":0" />

During these years, Denver attended Mansfeld Junior High School<ref>{{Cite web |title=Preservation Master Plan - Mansfeld Middle School, Tucson |url=https://capla.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/Mansfeld%20MS%20Preservation%20Plan.pdf }}</ref> and was a member of the [[Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus]] for two years. He was content in Tucson, but his father was transferred to [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. The family later moved to [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth|Carswell Air Force Base]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where Denver graduated from [[Arlington Heights High School]]. Denver was distressed with life in Fort Worth, and in his third year of high school, he drove his father's car to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. His father flew to California in a friend's jet to retrieve him, and Denver reluctantly returned to complete his schooling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708100625/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=John Denver |via=Find Articles |access-date=May 9, 2011 |year=2002}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career===
At age 11, Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother.<ref name="bio" /> He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college. Denver decided to change his name when [[Randy Sparks]], founder of [[the New Christy Minstrels]], suggested that 'Deutschendorf' would not fit comfortably on a [[Marquee (structure)|marquee]].<ref name="sparks" /> Denver attended [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] and sang in a folk-music group, "The Alpine Trio", while studying architecture.<ref name="bio2">{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Ca-Fi/Denver-John.html |title=John Denver Biography |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |publisher=Texas Tech University |year=1962 |title=La Ventana, vol. 37 |hdl=2346/48702}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |publisher=Texas Tech University|year=1964 |title=La Ventana, vol. 39 |hdl=2346/48704}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity. Denver dropped out of Texas Tech in 1963<ref name="bio" /> and moved to Los Angeles, where he sang in folk clubs. In 1965, Denver joined [[The Chad Mitchell Trio]], replacing founder Chad Mitchell. After more personnel changes, the trio later became known as "Denver, Boise, and Johnson" (John Denver, David Boise, and [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]]).<ref name="bio" />

In 1969, Denver abandoned band life to pursue a solo career and released his first album for [[RCA Records]], ''[[Rhymes & Reasons (John Denver album)|Rhymes & Reasons]]''. Two years earlier, he had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts. It included a song Denver had written called "Babe, I Hate to Go", later renamed "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]". He made several copies and gave them out as presents for Christmas.<ref>[http://www.johndenver.com/current/current.html Current Events] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205131958/http://www.johndenver.com/current/current.html |date=December 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Milt Okun]], who produced records for The Chad Mitchell Trio and folk group [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], had become Denver's producer as well. Okun brought the unreleased "Jet Plane" song to Peter, Paul and Mary. Their rendition hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ruhlman | first = William | title = Beginnings| work=Goldmine Magazine | date = April 12, 1996 | url =http://www.peterpaulandmary.com/history/f-ruhlmann3.htm | access-date =January 24, 2010}}</ref> Denver's song also made it to No. 2 in the UK in February 1970, having also made No. 1 on the US Cash Box chart in December 1969.

RCA did not actively promote ''Rhymes & Reasons'' with a tour, but Denver embarked on an impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities, offering to play free concerts at local venues. When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or coffeehouse to let him play, Denver distributed posters in the town and usually showed up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/2015/11/25/denver-john/ |title=Denver, John |publisher=New Mexico Music Commission |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref> As the writer of "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]", Denver was often successful in gaining some promotional airtime, usually performing one or two songs live. Some venues let him play for the 'door'; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this, Denver had built a solid fan base, many of whom remained loyal throughout his career.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://johndenver.com/about/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=johndenver.com |access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref>

Denver recorded two more albums in 1970, ''[[Take Me to Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[Whose Garden Was This]]'', including a mix of songs he had written and covers.

[[File:John Denver 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Denver in 1973]]
Denver's next album, ''[[Poems, Prayers & Promises]]'' (1971), was a breakthrough for him in the United States, thanks in part to the single "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", which went to No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' charts despite the first pressings of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a reissue of the track and began a radio airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished thereafter, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver had his first Top Ten album with ''[[Rocky Mountain High (album)|Rocky Mountain High]]'', with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1973-02-17/hot-100 |title=Top 100 Music Hits, Top 100 Music Charts, Top 100 Songs & The Hot 100 |magazine=Billboard |date=September 12, 2008 |access-date=August 17, 2010}}</ref> In 1974 and 1975, Denver had a string of four No. 1 songs ("[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]", "[[Annie's Song]]", "[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]", and "[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]") and three No. 1 albums (''[[John Denver's Greatest Hits]]'', ''[[Back Home Again (John Denver album)|Back Home Again]]'', and ''[[Windsong]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-john-denver.php |title=Artist Biography – John Denver |publisher=Countrypolitan.com |date=October 12, 1997 |access-date=May 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221215317/http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-john-denver.php |archive-date=February 21, 2001}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Denver's onstage appearance included long blond hair and wire-rimmed "granny" glasses. His embroidered shirts with images commonly associated with the American West were created by the designer and appliqué artist Anna Zapp. Weintraub insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in the United Kingdom, despite Denver's protests at the time, "I've had no success in Britain&nbsp;... I mean ''none''".<ref>''John Denver: Rocky Mountain Wonderboy,'' James M. Martin, Pinnacle Books 1977</ref> In December 1976, Weintraub told Maureen Orth of ''Newsweek'': "I knew the critics would never go for John. I had to get him to the people."

After appearing as a guest on many shows, Denver hosted his own variety and music specials, including several concerts from [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]]. His seasonal special, ''Rocky Mountain Christmas'', was watched by more than 60 million people and was the highest-rated show for the ABC network at that time.

In 1973, Denver starred in his own [[BBC Two|BBC]] television series, ''The John Denver Show'', a weekly music and variety show directed and produced by [[Stanley Dorfman]].

Denver was also a guest star on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Denver and [[Jim Henson]] that spawned two television specials with [[the Muppets]], ''A Christmas Together'' and ''Rocky Mountain Holiday''. He also tried acting, appearing in "The Camerons are a Special Clan" episode of the ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'' television series in October 1973 and "The Colorado Cattle Caper" episode of the ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' television series in February 1974. In 1977, Denver starred in the hit comedy film ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' opposite [[George Burns]]. He also hosted the [[Grammy Awards]] five times in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest-hosted ''The Tonight Show'' on several occasions. In 1975, Denver was awarded the [[Country Music Association]]'s Entertainer of the Year award. At the ceremony, the outgoing Entertainer of the Year, [[Charlie Rich]], presented the award to his successor after he set fire to the slip of paper containing the official notification of the award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf3t3unp-Gg |title=Charlie Rich Sets Fire to John Denver's CMA Slip 1975 |website=youtube.com |date=December 27, 2019 |access-date=September 14, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/76893/episode_featured_copy.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320051946/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/76893/episode_featured_copy.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |title=The Greatest : Features |publisher=Country Music Television |date=April 3, 1992 |access-date=August 10, 2018}}</ref> Some speculated Rich was protesting the selection of a non-traditional country artist for the award, but Rich's son disputes that, saying his father was drunk, taking pain medication for a broken foot, and just trying to be funny. Denver's music was defended by country singer [[Kathy Mattea]], who told Alanna Nash of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'': "A lot of people write him off as lightweight, but he articulated a kind of optimism, and he brought acoustic music to the forefront, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way&nbsp;... People forget how huge he was worldwide."

In 1977, Denver co-founded [[The Hunger Project]] with [[Werner Erhard]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]]. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed Denver to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger. Denver wrote the song "I Want to Live" as the commission's theme song. In 1979, Denver performed "Rhymes & Reasons" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]]. Royalties from the concert performances were donated to [[UNICEF]].<ref>{{cite web |author=thepiperchile |url=http://www.abbaontv.com/1979/description-unicef1.html |title=ABBA on TV – Music for UNICEF – A Gift of Song Concert |publisher=Abbaontv.com |access-date=May 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072734/http://www.abbaontv.com/1979/description-unicef1.html |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> 

Denver's father taught him to fly in the mid-1970s, which led to their reconciliation.<ref name="bio2" /> In 1980, Denver and his father, by then a [[lieutenant colonel]], co-hosted an award-winning television special, ''The Higher We Fly: The History of Flight''.<ref name="JD">{{cite web |title=Biography – The World Family of John Denver |url=http://www.john-denver.org/default.asp?nc=1168&id=444 |access-date=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628051820/http://www.john-denver.org/default.asp?nc=1168&id=444 |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |date=June 28, 2006}}</ref> It won the Osborn Award from the Aviation/Space Writers' Association, and was honored by the Houston Film Festival.<ref name="JD" />

== Political views and activism ==
In the mid-1970s, Denver became outspoken in politics. He expressed his ecologic interests in the epic 1975 song "[[Calypso (John Denver song)|Calypso]]", an ode to the eponymous exploration ship {{RV|Calypso}} used by [[Jacques Cousteau]]. In 1976, Denver campaigned for [[Jimmy Carter]], who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|African AIDS crisis]]. He founded the charitable [[Windstar Foundation]] in 1976 to promote [[sustainable living]]. Denver's dismay at the [[Chernobyl disaster]] led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.<ref name="bio2" />

During the 1980s, Denver was critical of [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan’s administration]] and remained active in his campaign against hunger, for which Reagan awarded Denver the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1987.<ref name="bio2" /> Denver's criticism of the conservative politics of the 1980s was expressed in his autobiographical folk-rock ballad "Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For?)". In an open letter to the media, Denver wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. He had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President [[Bill Clinton]] for his opposition to the proposed drilling. The letter, which Denver wrote in the midst of the [[1996 United States presidential election]], was one of the last he ever wrote.<ref name="bio2" /> In 1992, Denver, along with fellow singers [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[John Oates]], performed a benefit to fight the passage of [[1992 Colorado Amendment 2|Amendment 2]], an [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-LGBT]] ballot measure that prevented Colorado municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination protections.<ref>{{Cite web |last=By |date=December 22, 1992 |title=Benefit planned to fight anti-gay law in colorado |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1992-12-22-9212220448-story.html/ |access-date=July 18, 2023 |website=Orlando Sentinel |language=en-US}}</ref>  Denver was also on the [[National Space Society]]'s board of governors for many years.

== Later years and humanitarian efforts ==
Denver had a few more US Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. Denver began to focus more on humanitarian and [[sustainability]] causes, focusing extensively on [[nature conservation]] projects. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological design researchers such as [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]] (about whom he wrote and composed "What One Man Can Do") and [[Amory Lovins]], from whom he said he learned much. Denver also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000). He also had a keen interest in solutions to world hunger and visited Africa during the 1980s to witness firsthand the suffering caused by starvation and work with African leaders toward solutions.

From 1973 to at least 1979, Denver annually performed at the fundraising picnic for the Aspen Camp School for the Deaf, raising half of the camp's annual operating budget.<ref name="barb1">{{cite news |last1=Isenberg |first1=Barbara |title=Aspen Takes a Mellow Stance Towards John Denver's Gas Tank |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/493749518/? |access-date=December 18, 2018 |work=The Record |agency=Los Angeles Times News Service |date=August 20, 1979}}</ref> During the Aspen Valley Hospital's $1.7&nbsp;million capital campaign in 1979, Denver was the largest single donor.<ref name="barb1" />

In 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual Grammy Awards, which he had previously done in 1977, 1978, and 1979. In the 1983 finale, he was joined on stage by folk music legend [[Joan Baez]], with whom Denver led an all-star version of "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Let the Sunshine In]]", joined by such diverse musical icons as [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[Donna Summer]], and [[Rick James]].

In 1984, [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] president [[Roone Arledge]] asked Denver to compose and sing the theme song for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sarajevo]]. Denver worked as both a performer and a skiing commentator, as skiing was another of his enthusiasms. Denver composed "The Gold and Beyond", and sang it for the Olympic Games athletes, as well as local venues including many schools.<ref name="JD" />

In 1985, Denver asked to participate in the singing of "[[We Are the World]]" but was rejected, despite his obvious genuine commitment to charity work and his musical talent. According to [[Ken Kragen]] (who helped produce the song), Denver was snubbed because many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. "I didn't agree with this assessment," Kragen said, but he reluctantly turned Denver down anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrychapin.com/circle/winter05/behind.htm |title= Behind the Song: "We Are the World" |publisher=HarryChapin.com |first=Mike |last=Grayeb |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> Denver later wrote in his 1994 autobiography "Take Me Home" about the rejection, "It broke my heart not to be included."<ref>https://danmiller.typepad.com/dan_millers_notebook/2006/07/by_dan_miller_o.html {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>
[[File:John Denver.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denver at the 1995 [[National Memorial Day Concert]]]]
For Earth Day 1990, Denver was the on-camera narrator of a well-received environmental television program, ''In Partnership With Earth,'' with then-[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Administrator [[William K. Reilly]].

Due to his love of flying, Denver was attracted to [[NASA]] and became dedicated to America's work in outer space. He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the "Citizens in Space" program. In 1985, Denver received the [[NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal]] for "helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world", an award usually restricted to spaceflight engineers and designers. That same year, he passed NASA's rigorous physical exam and was in line for a space flight, a finalist for the first citizen's trip on the [[Space Shuttle]] in 1986. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] with teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]] aboard, Denver dedicated his song "Flying for Me" to all astronauts, and continued to support NASA.<ref name="JD" /> He entered discussions with the Soviet space program about purchasing a flight aboard one of their rockets. The talks fell through after the price tag was rumored to be as high as $20&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mullane |first=R. |title=Riding rockets: the outrageous tales of a space shuttle astronaut |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-7432-7682-5 |oclc=62118471}}</ref>

In 1997, Denver filmed an episode for the television series ''[[Nature (TV program)|Nature]]'', centering on the natural wonders that inspired many of his best-loved songs.

Beyond music, Denver's artistic interests included painting, but because of his limiting schedule, Denver pursued photography, saying once, "photography is a way to communicate a feeling." An exhibition of over 40 never-before-seen photographs taken by Denver debuted at the Leon Gallery in [[Denver]], Colorado, in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sweet, Sweet Life: The Photographic Works of John Denver |url=https://johndenver.com/news/sweet-sweet-life-the-photographic-works-of-john-denver/ |website=johndenver.com |date=December 18, 2013}}</ref>

Denver died on the afternoon of October 12, 1997, when his light [[homebuilt aircraft]], a [[Rutan Long-EZ]] with [[Aircraft registration|registration number]] N555JD, crashed into [[Monterey Bay]] near [[Pacific Grove, California]], while making a series of [[touch-and-go landing]]s at the nearby [[Monterey Regional Airport|Monterey Peninsula Airport]].<ref name="AVW" /> He was the plane's only occupant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kligman |first1=David |title=John Denver dies in crash // Singer's experimental plane falls into ocean |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4413095.html |work=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=July 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610055804/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4413095.html |archive-date=June 10, 2014 |date=October 13, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockmine.com/Archive/Vault/DeaCert/Denver.html |title=Archive : Vault : Death Certificates: John Denver |publisher=Rockmine |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The official cause of death was [[blunt trauma|multiple blunt force trauma]] resulting from the crash.

Denver was a pilot with over 2,700 hours of experience. He had [[Pilot licensing and certification|pilot ratings]] for single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, glider and instrument. Denver also held a [[type rating]] in his Learjet. He had recently purchased the Long-EZ aircraft, made by someone else from a kit,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jun-23-mn-62708-story.html|title=John Denver Plane Crash Inquiry Ends|agency=Associated Press|date=June 23, 1998|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> and had taken a half-hour checkout flight with the aircraft the day before his accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/John-Denver-N555JD.htm |title=Denver's Long-EZ |publisher=Check-six.com |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="urlwww.ntsb.gov">{{cite press release|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/news/1999/990126.htm |title=NTSB Determines John Denver's Crash Caused by Poor Placement of Fuel Selector Handle Diverting His Attention During Flight|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) |access-date=December 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724010104/https://www.ntsb.gov/news/1999/990126.htm|archive-date=July 24, 2012}}</ref>

Denver was not legally permitted to fly at the time of the crash. In previous years, he had been arrested several times for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/John-Denver-dies-in-crash-3095382.php |title=John Denver dies in crash |date= October 13, 1997 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first1=Zachary |last1=Coile |first2=Emily |last2=Gurnon |first3=Larry D. |last3=Hatfield |access-date=September 26, 2016}}</ref> In 1996, nearly a year before the accident, the FAA learned that Denver had failed to maintain sobriety by not refraining entirely from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and revoked his medical certification.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> However, it was determined that the crash was not caused or influenced by alcohol use; an autopsy found no signs of alcohol or other drugs in Denver's body.<ref name="AVW" />

The post-accident investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) showed that the leading cause of the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight. His newly purchased amateur-built Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The handle had originally been intended by the plane's designer to be between the pilot's legs. The builder instead put it behind the pilot's left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and was not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" />

Before the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]], but this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valve’s positioning, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (nose right) and pitch up.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" />

The mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver that there was "less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered from the wreckage. Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft, saying that he would only be flying for about an hour.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" />

The NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> Four said the aircraft was originally heading west. Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four saying that the bank was to the right (north). Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent. Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude between {{convert|350 and 500|ft}} when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said they heard a "pop" or "backfire" accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea.

In addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hard-to-reach place.<ref name="AVW" /><ref name="NTSB" /> The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating home-built aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.

Upon the announcement of Denver's death, Colorado Governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half-staff]] in his honor. Funeral services were held at Faith Presbyterian Church in [[Aurora, Colorado]], on October 17, 1997, officiated by Pastor Les Felker, a retired Air Force chaplain, after which Denver's remains were cremated and his ashes scattered in the Rocky Mountains. Further tributes were made at the following Grammy and [[Country Music Association]] Awards.

In 1998, Denver posthumously received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[World Folk Music Association]], which also established a new award in his honor.<ref name="noble">{{cite book|title=Number #1 : the story of the original Highwaymen|last=Noble|first=Richard E.|publisher=Outskirts Press|year=2009|isbn=9781432738099|location=Denver|pages=265–267|oclc=426388468}}</ref>

In 2000, CBS presented the television film ''Take Me Home: The John Denver Story'' loosely based on his memoirs, starring [[Chad Lowe]] as Denver. The ''New York Post'' wrote, "An overachiever like John Denver couldn't have been this boring".<ref>Buckman, Adam. "Home Movie Disses Denver", ''[[New York Post]]'', April 29, 2000.</ref> 

[[File:John Denver bench.jpg|thumb|The John Denver Bench at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in [[Kempton, PA]]]] That same year on April 22, [[Hawk Mountain Sanctuary]] in [[Kempton, Pennsylvania]] dedicated a bench that was funded by donations as a tribute to his memory for that year's Earth Day. The bench sits on the South Lookout of the sanctuary.

On September 23, 2007, nearly 10 years after Denver's death, his brother Ron witnessed the dedication of a plaque placed near the crash site in Pacific Grove, California.

Copies of DVDs of Denver's many television appearances are now sought-after collectibles, especially his one-hour specials from the 1970s and his six-part series for Britain's BBC, ''The John Denver Show''. An anthology musical featuring Denver's music, ''Back Home Again: A John Denver Holiday'', premiered at the Rubicon Theatre Company in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shellworld.net/~emily/jdfriend.html |title=John Denver and Friends Rocky Mountain High |publisher=Shellworld.net |date=April 17, 2009 |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

On March 12, 2007, the [[Colorado Senate]] passed a resolution to make Denver's trademark 1972 hit "[[Rocky Mountain High]]" one of the state's two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, "[[Where the Columbines Grow]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/co_rocky_mountain_high.htm |title=Colorado State Song Rocky Mountain High composed by John Denver |publisher=Netstate.com |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The resolution passed 50–11 in the House, defeating an objection by Representative [[Debbie Stafford]] that the song reflected drug use, most specifically in the line "friends around the campfire and everybody's high". Senator [[Bob Hagedorn]], who sponsored the proposal, defended the song as having nothing to do with drugs, but rather everything to do with sharing with friends the euphoria of experiencing the beauty of Colorado's mountain vistas. Senator Nancy Todd said, "John Denver to me is an icon of what Colorado is".<ref>''Denver Post'', March 13, 2007</ref>

On September 24, 2007, the California Friends of John Denver and The Windstar Foundation unveiled a bronze plaque near the spot where his plane went down. The site had been marked by a driftwood log carved by Jeffrey Pine with Denver's name, but fears that the memorial could be washed out to sea sparked the campaign for a more permanent memorial. Initially, the Pacific Grove Council denied permission for the memorial, fearing the place would attract ghoulish curiosity from extreme fans. Permission was finally granted in 1999, but the project was put on hold at the request of Denver's family. Eventually, over 100 friends and family attended the dedication of the plaque, which features a [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] of the singer's face and lines from his song "Windsong": "So welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers. Follow her summons when she calls again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johndenverclub.org/JohnDenverPlaque/johndenvermemorialplaquepacificgrove.html |title=John Denver Memorial Plaque Pacific Grove |publisher=Johndenverclub.org |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

To mark the 10th anniversary of Denver's death, his family released a set of previously unreleased recordings of his 1985 concert performances in the [[Soviet Union]]. This two-CD set, ''John Denver – Live in the USSR'', was produced by [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]] and released by AAO Music. These digital recordings were made during 11 concerts and then rediscovered in 2002. Included in this set is a previously unpublished rendition of "[[Annie's Song]]" in Russian. The collection was released November 6, 2007.<ref name="Windstar_Russia_CD" />

On October 13, 2009, a DVD box set of previously unreleased concerts recorded throughout Denver's career was released by [[Eagle Rock Entertainment]]. ''Around the World Live'' is a 5-disc DVD set featuring three complete live performances with full band from Australia in 1977, Japan in 1981, and England in 1986. These are complemented by a solo acoustic performance from Japan in 1984 and performances at [[Farm Aid]] from 1985, 1987, and 1990. The final disc has two-hour-long documentaries made by Denver.

On April 21, 2011, Denver became the first inductee into the [[Colorado Music Hall of Fame]]. A benefit concert was held at Broomfield's [[1stBank Center]] and hosted by [[Olivia Newton-John]]. Other performers participating in the event included the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Lee Ann Womack]], and [[John Oates]]. Both his ex-wives attended, and the award was presented to his three children.

The [[Spirit (sculpture)|John Denver ''Spirit'' sculpture]] is a 2002 bronze sculpture statue by artist [[Sue DiCicco]] that was financed by Denver's fans. It is at the [[Colorado Music Hall of Fame]] at Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

Hiatt was working as a songwriter for Tree International, a record label in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], when his song "[[Sure As I'm Sittin' Here]]" was covered by [[Three Dog Night]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The song became a Top 40 hit, earning Hiatt a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]. Since then he has released 22 studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album.

== Early life ==
[[File:John Hiatt and The Combo ZMF 2015 jm43231.jpg|170px|thumb|Hiatt at the Zelt-Musik-Festival 2015 in Freiburg, Germany]]
Hiatt was born in 1952 to Robert and Ruth Hiatt, the sixth of seven children in a Roman Catholic family from [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. When he was 9 years old, Hiatt's 21-year-old brother Michael died by suicide. Two years later, his father died after a long illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/magazine/rocker-john-hiatt-as-good-as-his-words.html |title=Rocker John Hiatt: As Good as His Words – New York Times |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1989-03-12 |access-date=2014-07-10}}</ref> To escape the stress of his early life, Hiatt watched [[IndyCar]] racing and listened to [[Elvis Presley]], Bob Dylan, and the [[blues]]. In his youth, Hiatt reports that he and several others stole a [[Ford Thunderbird]], a crime for which he was caught by the owners but got away with posing as a hitchhiker. He learned to play the guitar when he was 11 and began his musical career in Indianapolis as a teenager.<ref name="unicom1">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicom.com/retired/john-hiatt/interview-rso.html |title=Rolling Stone Online: John Hiatt Interview |publisher=Unicom.com |date=1997-06-29 |access-date=2014-07-10}}</ref> He played in a various local clubs such as Hummingbird and also with bands, including The Four-Fifths and John Lynch & the Hangmen.

== Career ==
Hiatt moved to Nashville, Tennessee, when he was 18 years old and got a job as a songwriter for the Tree-Music Publishing Company for $25 a week (equivalent to about $203 in 2024).<ref name="unicom1" /> Hiatt, who was unable to read or write scores, had to record all 250 songs he wrote for the company. In 1972 he also began playing with the band White Duck<ref name="sdt">{{cite web|url=https://sandiegotroubadour.com/the-slow-turning-of-john-hiatt-from-genre-pioneer-to-americanas-elder-statesman/ |title= ROADThe Slow Turning of John Hiatt: From Genre Pioneer to Americana's Elder Statesmanby |author= Terry Roland |publisher=San Diego Troubadour |date=2012-09-01 |access-date=2023-12-29}}</ref> as one of three singer-songwriters within the group. White Duck had already recorded one album before Hiatt joined. He wrote and performed two songs on their second album ''In Season''. Hiatt performed live in many clubs around Nashville with White Duck and also as a solo act.

=== Early solo career (1974–78) ===
Hiatt met [[Don Ellis]] of [[Epic Records]] in 1973, and received a record deal, releasing his first single "We Make Spirit" later that year. That same year Hiatt wrote the song "Sure as I'm Sitting Here" recorded by Three Dog Night,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> which went to number 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart in 1974.

In 1974, Hiatt released ''[[Hangin' Around the Observatory]]'', which was a critical success but a commercial failure. A year later, ''[[Overcoats (album)|Overcoats]]'' was released and when it also failed to sell, Epic Records released Hiatt from his contract.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> For the next four years he was without a recording contract. During this time his style evolved from country-rock to [[New wave music|new wave]] of [[Elvis Costello]], Nick Lowe and [[Graham Parker]], among others.

=== MCA/Geffen years (1979–1986) ===
Hiatt was picked up by the [[MCA Records|MCA]] label in 1979.<ref name="sdt" /> He released two albums for the label – ''[[Slug Line]]'' (1979) and ''[[Two Bit Monsters]]'' (1980) – neither of which met with commercial success. He received a few good reviews for these albums by critics in the Netherlands. He performed at [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] in Amsterdam for the first time in 1979 (opening for [[Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes]]) and came back often and built a solid fan base. In 1982, "Across the Borderline", written by Hiatt with [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Jim Dickinson]], appeared on the soundtrack to the motion picture ''The Border'', sung by country star [[Freddy Fender]]. The song was later covered on albums by [[Willie Nelson]], [[Paul Young]], [[Rubén Blades]] and [[Willy DeVille]], among others, as well as by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and Bob Dylan in concert. 

Hiatt was signed in 1982 to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] (which later absorbed MCA),<ref name="sdt" /> where he recorded three diverse albums from 1982 to 1985. The first, ''[[All of a Sudden (album)|All of a Sudden]]'', was produced by [[Tony Visconti]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> and featured use of keyboards and synthesizers; his future albums combined country and soul influences. ''[[Riding with the King (John Hiatt album)|Riding with the King]]'' appeared in 1983, produced by [[Scott Mathews]], [[Ron Nagle]] and [[Nick Lowe]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Hiatt began making "critics choice" lists and building a large European following. The title track of ''Riding with the King'' (taken from an odd dream Scott Mathews had) was re-recorded two decades later by Eric Clapton and B. B. King and went double platinum.

During this period, Rosanne Cash covered several Hiatt compositions, taking "It Hasn't Happened Yet" to the Top 20 on the country charts. In 1983, Cash did a duet with Hiatt on his "[[The Way We Make a Broken Heart]]" produced by Nick Lowe. When Geffen failed to release the single, Cash re-recorded it in 1987 and it went to No. 1 on the US country charts. It was during this time that [[Asleep at the Wheel]] covered the song. [[Ricky Nelson]] covered "It Hasn't Happened Yet" on his 1981 album ''Playing to Win''.

Hiatt recorded a duet with Elvis Costello, a cover version of [[The Spinners (soul music)|the Spinners]]' song "Living a Little, Laughing a Little", which appeared on ''[[Warming Up to the Ice Age]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Shortly after its release, Bob Dylan covered Hiatt's song "The Usual", which had appeared on the soundtrack to ''[[Hearts of Fire]]''. However, Geffen dropped Hiatt from the label after ''Ice Age'' failed to chart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

=== Success (1987–1989) ===
Hiatt finally came into success in 1987, when he released ''[[Bring the Family]]''. For the album, Hiatt had a backing band consisting of [[Ry Cooder]], [[Nick Lowe]], and [[Jim Keltner]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Two of the songs on the album have been extensively covered: "[[Have a Little Faith in Me]]," which has been interpreted by a number of artists, including [[Joe Cocker]], [[Delbert McClinton]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Mandy Moore]] and [[Bon Jovi]]; and "Memphis in the Meantime", which has been covered by [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chris Smither]], [[Spafford (band)|Spafford]], and [[Gregg Allman]]. "Thank You Girl" was a moderate radio hit, and the B-side of the single featured a non-album duet with [[Loudon Wainwright III]] on a cover of the [[Temptations]]’ hit "My Girl" (Hiatt returned the favor on the B-side of Wainwright's single "Your Mother and I"). Most notably, Bonnie Raitt brought "Thing Called Love" to No. 11 on the US charts with her 1989 release ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]''.

Following ''Bring the Family'', Hiatt had a string of nine straight studio albums which hit the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

In 1988, he returned to the studio with Glyn Johns producing<ref name=Johns>{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Glyn |title=Sound Man |date=2015 |publisher=Plume/Penguin Random House, LLC |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-14-751657-2 |pages=268–273 |edition=First (Plume)}}</ref> to record ''[[Slow Turning]]'', which was his first album to hit the upper half of the Billboard 200.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> It featured his only top 10 chart single, the title track, which hit No. 8 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, and "Tennessee Plates", which was used in the soundtrack of the [[Ridley Scott]] directed and [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' in 1991. [[The Jeff Healey Band]] covered the Hiatt-penned song "[[Angel Eyes (The Jeff Healey Band song)|Angel Eyes]]" and took it to the top five of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

=== 1990s and beyond ===
[[File:John Hiatt op Halfway Amsterdam festival 1994 - 13.jpg|thumb|At Halfway Amsterdam festival 1994.]]
In 1992, Cooder, Keltner, and Lowe again backed up Hiatt, but this time they gave themselves the band name [[Little Village]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> a reference to a [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] song. Expectations for the ''[[Little Village (album)|Little Village]]'' album were high, but the album failed to even chart as high as Hiatt's last solo album. The group disbanded after a moderately successful tour.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Conversely, country artist [[Suzy Bogguss]] scored a No. 2 hit that year with a cover of Hiatt's song "Drive South."

Hiatt recorded ''[[Perfectly Good Guitar]]'' with members of alternative rock groups [[School of Fish]] and [[Wire Train]] in 1993.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Hiatt recorded the album with producer Matt Wallace, who had worked most prominently with [[Faith No More]], a band that Hiatt's 15-year-old stepson had recommended for him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Renee|url=http://www.unicom.com/retired/john-hiatt/article-rh.html|title=Joys of Bust-'em-up Rock|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=March 3, 1994}}</ref> It was Hiatt's highest-peaking album at No. 47, but was not the commercial breakthrough A&M expected.

Also in 1993, ''Love Gets Strange: The Songs of John Hiatt,'' a compilation album of covers of Hiatt's songs, was released. This was followed by an album of original covers ''Rollin' into Memphis: Songs of John Hiatt'' in 2000, and a second compilation album with a few originals, titled ''It'll Come To You...The Songs of John Hiatt,'' in 2003.

In 1994, Hiatt released ''[[Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan?]]'', his first official live album and his last album with [[A&M Records]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> A CD and DVD of his performance on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' was released in 2005. Hiatt previously released two promotional live promotional "official bootlegs", ''Riot with Hiatt'' in 1985, and ''Live at the Hiatt'' in 1993, as well as the EP ''Live at the Palace'' in 1991. Hiatt received his first Grammy nomination in 1995 for his album ''Walk On''. 

In 2000, Hiatt released his first independent album on [[Vanguard Records]], ''[[Crossing Muddy Waters]]'', which saw a heavy influence of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] in his music. Later that year, he was named songwriter/artist of the year at the Nashville Music Awards. In 2001, ''Crossing Muddy Waters'' was nominated for a Grammy Award for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]], with [[Davey Faragher]] and [[David Immerglück]] as his only accompanists. In 2002, Hiatt performed several songs for the soundtrack of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[The Country Bears]]'' movie, again with Johns producing,<ref name=Johns/> representing the voice of the lead singer. The movie featured covers of Hiatt songs by Bonnie Raitt and [[Don Henley]].

Hiatt's next album, ''[[Master of Disaster]]'', was released on June 21, 2005. The album was produced by [[Jim Dickinson]], and Hiatt was backed up by the bassist [[David Hood]] and several members of the [[North Mississippi Allstars]]. The album achieved modest sales, becoming a top 10 independent album, but failed to achieve significant commercial success.
[[File:Hiatt.jpg|alt=|thumb|180px|Hiatt solo in 2010]]
On February 12, 2008, during a concert with [[Lyle Lovett]] at the [[National Arts Centre]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Hiatt said that his new album would be titled ''Same Old Man''. It was released on May 27, 2008.

On September 17, 2008, he appeared in [[Ramble at the Ryman|Levon Helm's Ramble at the Ryman]] singing "[[The Weight]]" at the historic Ryman Auditorium, in Nashville.

Hiatt appeared as a performer in ''The House of Blues'' in the sixth episode of the second season of ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', with the episode title taken from his song ''[[Feels Like Rain]]''. The episode aired May 29, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Dave|url=http://www.nola.com/treme-hbo/index.ssf/2011/05/treme_explained_feels_like_rai.html|title='Treme' explained: 'Feels Like Rain'|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> 

Hiatt presented an Americana Lifetime Achievement Award to Bonnie Raitt on September 12, 2012. The two performed "Thing Called Love" together at the ceremony.

On July 15, 2014, Hiatt released ''Terms of My Surrender'', his 22nd studio album. It earned him two Grammy nominations.

On October 12, 2018, Hiatt released ''The Eclipse Sessions'', an LP via New West Records. The album, his first in four years, was recorded over four days in the summer of 2017, a period that included the August 21 solar eclipse. Hiatt recorded the album as part of a trio of guitar, bass (Patrick O’Hearn), and drums (Kenneth Blevins).

== Personal life ==
Hiatt has two daughters, singer-songwriter [[Lilly Hiatt]] and Georgia Rae Hiatt, and a stepson, Robert.<ref name="NewYorkTimes">{{cite news |last1=Steinberg |first1=Jacques |title=The Lyrics?

He is known for his brand of [[heartland rock]], which emphasizes traditional instrumentation.

Mellencamp found success in the 1980s while "honing an almost startlingly plainspoken writing style" <ref>{{cite magazine|title=One from the Heartland|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/02/mellencamp200702|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=January 9, 2007|access-date=August 11, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221206142907/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/02/mellencamp200702|archive-date=December 6, 2022}}</ref> that, starting in 1982, yielded a string of Top 10 singles, including "[[Hurts So Good]]," "[[Jack & Diane]]," "[[Crumblin' Down]]," "[[Pink Houses]]," "[[Lonely Ol' Night]]," "[[Small Town]]," "[[R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.]]," "[[Paper in Fire]]", and "[[Cherry Bomb (John Mellencamp song)|Cherry Bomb]]." He has scored fourteen Top 20 hits in the United States. In addition, he holds the record for the most songs by a solo artist to hit number one on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, with seven. Mellencamp has been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Awards]], winning one. He has sold over 60 million albums worldwide, with 30 million in the US. His latest album of original songs, ''[[Orpheus Descending (album)|Orpheus Descending]]'', was released in June 2023.

Mellencamp is also one of the founding members of [[Farm Aid]], an organization that began in 1985 with a concert in [[Champaign, Illinois]] to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 37 years, and {{as of|2023|lc=y}} the organization has raised over $60&nbsp;million.

==Early life==
Mellencamp was born in the small town of [[Seymour, Indiana]] on October 7, 1951. He is of [[German Americans|German]] and [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]] ancestry. He was born with [[spina bifida]], for which he had corrective surgery as an infant. Mellencamp formed his first band, Crepe Soul when he was 14.<ref name="Yahoo Music">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257234-bio--John-Mellencamp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516061334/http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257234-bio--John-Mellencamp|url-status=dead|title=John Mellencamp: Biography on Yahoo! Music|archive-date=May 16, 2008}}</ref>

Mellencamp attended [[Vincennes University]], a two-year college{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} in [[Vincennes, Indiana]], starting in 1972. During this time, he abused drugs and alcohol.<ref name=Wildcat>{{Cite news |url=https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/2005/11/01/mellencamp-wildcat-no-more/118095880/ |last=Fricke |first=David |author-link=David Fricke |title=Mellencamp: wildcat no more |work=[[The Herald-Times]] |location=Bloomington, Indiana  |date=February 2, 1986}}</ref>

During his college years, Mellencamp played in several local bands, including the [[glam rock]] band Trash, which was named for a [[New York Dolls]] song, and he later got a job in Seymour installing telephones.<ref name=Troubadour>{{Cite book |last=MASCIOTRA |first=DAVID |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv2fzkpw5 |title=Mellencamp: American Troubadour | year=2015 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |doi=10.2307/j.ctv2fzkpw5 |jstor=j.ctv2fzkpw5 |isbn=978-0-8131-9558-2 |s2cid=247995900 }}</ref> During this period, Mellencamp, who had given up drugs and alcohol before graduating from college, decided to pursue a career in music and traveled to New York City in an attempt to land a record contract.<ref name=Troubadour/>

==Music career==
===1976–1982: Performing as Johnny Cougar and John Cougar===
After 18 months of traveling between Indiana and New York City in 1974 and 1975, Mellencamp met [[Tony DeFries]] of MainMan Management, who was receptive to his music and image.<ref name=Wildcat/> DeFries insisted that Mellencamp's first album, ''[[Chestnut Street Incident]]'', a collection of [[cover version]]s and some original songs, be released under the stage name "Johnny Cougar", claiming that the name "Mellencamp" was too hard to market.<ref name=wragpret>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=roNfAAAAIBAJ&pg=2351%2C2851389 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=(Los Angeles Times)|last=Hunt |first=Dennis |title=Rock singer wages war against pretentiousness |date=December 7, 1980 |page=2D}}</ref> Mellencamp reluctantly agreed, but the album was a commercial failure, selling only 12,000 copies. Mellencamp confessed in a 2005 interview:

<blockquote>"That [name] was put on me by some manager. I went to New York, and everybody said, 'You sound like a hillbilly.' And I said, 'Well, I am.' So that's where he came up with that name. I was totally unaware of it until it showed up on the album jacket. When I objected to it, he said, 'Well, either you're going to go for it, or we're not going to put the record out.' So that was what I had to do... but I thought the name was pretty silly."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://americansongwriter.com/john-mellencamp/ |title=John Mellencamp Interview| magazine=[[American Songwriter]]}}</ref></blockquote>

Mellencamp recorded ''[[The Kid Inside]]'', the follow-up to ''Chestnut Street Incident'', in 1977. However, DeFries eventually decided against releasing the album, and Mellencamp was dropped from MCA records (DeFries finally released ''[[The Kid Inside]]'' in early 1983, after Mellencamp achieved stardom). Mellencamp drew interest from [[Rod Stewart]]'s manager, Billy Gaff, after parting ways with DeFries and was signed onto the small [[Riva Records]] label. At Gaff's request, Mellencamp moved to London, England, for nearly a year to record, promote, and tour behind 1978's ''[[A Biography]]''. The record wasn't released in the United States, but it yielded a top-five hit in Australia with "[[I Need a Lover]]."<ref name=Wildcat/> Riva Records added "I Need a Lover" to Mellencamp's next album released in the United States, 1979's ''[[John Cougar (album)|John Cougar]]'', where the song became a No. 28 single in late 1979. [[Pat Benatar]] recorded "I Need a Lover" on her debut album ''[[In the Heat of the Night (Pat Benatar album)|In the Heat of the Night]]''.

In 1980, Mellencamp returned with the [[Steve Cropper]]-produced ''[[Nothin' Matters and What If It Did]]'', which yielded two Top 40 singles – "This Time" (No. 27) and "Ain't Even Done With the Night" (No. 17). "The singles were stupid little pop songs," he told ''Record Magazine'' in 1983.

<blockquote>"I take no credit for that record. It wasn't like the title was made up – it wasn't supposed to be punky or cocky like some people thought. Toward the end, I didn't even go to the studio. Me and the guys in the band thought we were finished, anyway. It was the most expensive record I ever made. It cost $280,000, do you believe that? The worst thing was that I could have gone on making records like that for hundreds of years. Hell, as long as you sell a few records and the record company isn't putting a lot of money into promotion, you're making money for 'em and that's all they care about. PolyGram loved ''Nothin' Matters''. They thought I was going to turn into the next [[Neil Diamond]]."</blockquote>

In 1982, Mellencamp released his breakthrough album, ''[[American Fool]]'', which contained the singles "[[Hurts So Good]]," an uptempo rock tune that spent four weeks at No. 2 and 16 weeks in the top 10, and "[[Jack & Diane]]," which was a No. 1 hit for four weeks. A third single, "Hand to Hold on To," made it to No. 19. "Hurts So Good" went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] at the 25th [[Grammys]].

<blockquote>"To be real honest, there's three good songs on that record, and the rest is just sort of filler. It was too labored over, too thought about, and it wasn't organic enough. The record company thought it would bomb, but I think the reason it took off was – not that the songs were better than my others – but people liked the sound of it, the 'bam-bam-bam' drums. It was a different sound."</blockquote>

===1983–1990: Performing as John Cougar Mellencamp===
With some commercial success under his belt, Mellencamp had enough influence to force the record company to add his real surname, Mellencamp, to his stage moniker. The first album recorded under his new name John Cougar Mellencamp was 1983's ''[[Uh-Huh]]'', a Top-10 album that spawned the Top 10 singles "[[Pink Houses]]" and "[[Crumblin' Down]]" as well as the No. 15 hit "Authority Song," which he said is "our version of '[[I Fought the Law]].'" During the recording of ''Uh-Huh'', Mellencamp's backing band settled on the lineup it retained for the next several albums: [[Kenny Aronoff]] on drums and percussion, [[Larry Crane (guitarist)|Larry Crane]] and Mike Wanchic on guitars, [[Toby Myers]] on bass and John Cascella on keyboards. In 1988, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine called this version of Mellencamp's band "one of the most powerful and versatile live bands ever assembled." On the 1984 Uh-Huh Tour, Mellencamp opened his shows with cover versions of songs he admired growing up, including [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]," [[the Animals]]' "[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]," [[Lee Dorsey]]'s "[[Ya Ya]]," and the [[Left Banke]]'s "[[Pretty Ballerina]]."

In 1985, Mellencamp released ''[[Scarecrow (John Mellencamp album)|Scarecrow]]'', which peaked at No. 2 in the fall of 1985 and spawned five Top 40 singles: "[[Lonely Ol' Night]]" and "[[Small Town]]" (both No. 6), "[[R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.]]" (No. 2), "Rain on the Scarecrow" (No. 21) and "Rumble Seat" (No. 28). According to the February 1986 edition of ''Creem Magazine'', Mellencamp wanted to incorporate the sound of classic '60s rock into ''Scarecrow'', and he gave his band close to a hundred old singles to learn "almost mathematically verbatim" prior to recording the album.<ref name="Creem Magazine">{{cite web |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/john-cougar-mellencamp-working-class-hero-in-the-rumbleseat |title=John Cougar Mellencamp: Working Class Hero In The Rumbleseat |work=Creem Magazine}}</ref>

<blockquote>"Learning those songs did a lot of positive things. We realized more than ever what a big melting pot of all different types of music the '60s were. Take an old [[The Rascals|Rascals]] song, for example – there's everything from marching band beats to soul music to country sounds in one song. Learning those opened the band's vision to try new things on my songs. It wasn't; let's go back and try to make this part fit into my song, but I wanted to capture the same feeling – the way those songs used to make you feel. After a while, we didn't even have to talk about it anymore. If you listen to the lead Larry [Crane] plays on 'Face of the Nation,' he never would have played that 'cause he didn't really know who [[The Animals]] were. He's young, and he grew up listening to [[Grand Funk Railroad]]. You hear it, and it's like 'where did that come from?' It had to be from hearing those old records."<ref name="Creem Magazine"/></blockquote>

''Scarecrow'' was the first album Mellencamp recorded at his own recording studio, jokingly dubbed "[[Belmont Mall Studio|Belmont Mall]]," located in [[Belmont, Indiana]], and constructed in 1984. Mellencamp sees ''Scarecrow'' as the start of the [[alternative country]] genre:

<blockquote>"I think I invented that whole 'No Depression' thing with the ''Scarecrow'' album, though I don't get the credit."<ref>[http://www.mellencamp.com/index.php?page=news&n_id=374 UK's Classic Rock Magazine In-depth Mellencamp Interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031648/http://www.mellencamp.com/index.php?page=news&n_id=374 |date=March 4, 2016}} Classic Rock Magazine December 2008.</ref></blockquote>

In the liner notes to Mellencamp's 2010 box set ''[[On the Rural Route 7609]]'', Anthony DeCurtis wrote of Mellencamp's influence on the No Depression movement:

{{cquote|"In finding his voice as a lyricist and activist, Mellencamp also crafted a more fitting musical vision for himself (in the mid-1980s). Within the context of what was still undeniably the sound of a rock & roll band, he began incorporating instruments more characteristic of folk and roots music—dulcimer, mandolin, fiddle, accordion, dobro, and pennywhistle, among them. On albums like ''Scarecrow'' (1985), ''The Lonesome Jubilee'' (1987), and ''Big Daddy'' (1989), Mellencamp helped pioneer the sound of alternative country or No Depression, music that combines the truth-telling force of hard-core country with the instrumental attack of rock & roll.

If he has not been properly credited for that groundbreaking role, it's largely because he committed the unforgivable sin of actually having hits while making innovative music. Part of the No Depression mythology requires either a tragic early death or decades of unacknowledged masterpieces created during a life of grueling poverty. Writing and recording great songs that millions of people like and buy is not part of that sentimental picture—regardless of how comfortably the music itself sits within the genre's parameters."}}

Shortly after finishing ''Scarecrow'', Mellencamp helped organize the first [[Farm Aid]] benefit concert with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Neil Young]] in [[Champaign, Illinois]] on September 22, 1985. The Farm Aid concerts remain an annual event and have raised over $60&nbsp;million for struggling family farmers {{as of|2023|lc=y}}.

Prior to the 1985–86 Scarecrow Tour, during which he covered some of the same 1960s rock and soul songs he and his band rehearsed prior to the recording of ''Scarecrow'', Mellencamp added fiddle player [[Lisa Germano]] to his band. Germano would remain in Mellencamp's band until 1994 when she left to pursue a solo career.

Mellencamp's next studio album, 1987's ''[[The Lonesome Jubilee]]'', included the singles "[[Paper in Fire]]" (No. 9), "Cherry Bomb" (No. 8), "Check It Out" (No. 14), and "Rooty Toot Toot" (No. 61) along with the popular album tracks "Hard Times for an Honest Man" and "The Real Life", both of which cracked the top 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks]] chart.

<blockquote>"We were on the road for a long time after ''Scarecrow'', so we were together a lot as a band. For the first time ever, we talked about the record before we started. We had a very distinct vision of what should be happening here. At one point, ''[[The Lonesome Jubilee]]'' was supposed to be a double album, but at least 10 of the songs I'd written just didn't stick together with the idea and the sound we had in mind. So I just put those songs on a shelf, and cut it back down to a single record. Now, in the past, it was always 'Let's make it up as we go along' – and we did make some of ''The Lonesome Jubilee'' up as we went along. But we had a very clear idea of what we wanted it to sound like, even before it was written, right through to the day it was mastered."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/john-cougar-mellencamp-growing-up-in-public|title=John Cougar Mellencamp: Growing Up In Public|work=Creem Magazine}}</ref></blockquote>

As Frank DiGiacomo of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' wrote in 2007, "''The Lonesome Jubilee'' was the album in which Mellencamp defined his now signature sound: a rousing, crystalline mix of acoustic and electric guitars, Appalachian fiddle, and gospel-style backing vocals, anchored by a crisp, bare-knuckle drumbeat and completed by his own velveteen rasp."<ref name="frankdigiacomo.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.frankdigiacomo.com/articles/2007/02/john_mellencamp.php|title=John Mellencamp: One from the Heartland | date=February 2007}}</ref>

During the 1987–88 Lonesome Jubilee Tour, Mellencamp was joined onstage by surprise guest [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the end of his May 26, 1988, gig in Irvine, California, for a duet of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]," which Mellencamp performed as the penultimate song during each show on that tour. Said Mellencamp of his band during the 1987-88 Lonesome Jubilee Tour:

{{cquote|"Just then, we were the best band in the world, bar none. I mean, we were ''really'' good. All of that failure and frustration had energized every guy in the band to the infantile level of, 'We're going to show 'em all they were wrong.' It wasn't just me. When we walked out onstage, there wasn't a band on Earth to touch us. And it don't matter who you care to name ― [[U2]], [[The Rolling Stones]], anybody. We were better. Now, we weren't playing the best songs in the world. A lot of my songs weren't that great, but they were good enough. And as far as putting on a performance and entertaining goes, we were undeniably great. I wish I would've been able to enjoy it, but I was too busy slugging."<ref name="Mellencamp: The Biography">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bxs-EAAAQBAJ|title=John Mellencamp: The Biography | date=September 2021|isbn=9781982112141 |last1=Rees |first1=Paul |publisher=Simon and Schuster }}</ref>}}

In 1989, Mellencamp released the personal album ''[[Big Daddy (John Mellencamp album)|Big Daddy]]'', with the key tracks "Jackie Brown", "Big Daddy of Them All", and "Void in My Heart" accompanying the Top 15 single "Pop Singer". The album, which Mellencamp called at the time the most "earthy" record he'd ever made, is also the last to feature the "Cougar" moniker. In 1991, Mellencamp said: "'Big Daddy' was the best record I ever made. Out of my agony came a couple of really beautiful songs. You can't be 22 years old and had two dates and understand that album."<ref name="Associated Press">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=19911227&id=TPkaAAAAIBAJ&pg=6735,8372406|title= Mellencamp Finds Peace of Mind|publisher=Bowling Green Daily News | date=December 27, 1991}}</ref>

Mellencamp was heavily involved in painting at this time in his life and decided not to tour behind ''Big Daddy''.

<blockquote>"What's the point?... This other step that people keep wanting me to take to become another level of recording artist – to be Madonna? To sell out? To bend over? To kiss somebody's ass? I ain't gonna do it."<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeCurtis |first1=Anthony|title=Rocking My Life Away: Writing about Music and Other Matters |date=1999 |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |isbn=0822324199 |page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUnhwVCxlqcC&pg=PA110}}</ref> In his second painting exhibition, at the Churchman-Fehsenfeld Gallery in Indianapolis in 1990, Mellencamp's portraits were described as always having sad facial expressions and conveying "the same disillusionment found in his musical anthems about the nation's heartland and farm crisis."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20210224080950/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NTUiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zakFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3306,407736 Painting Provides a Respite] The Argus-Press May 4, 1990.</ref></blockquote>

===1991–1997: Performing as John Mellencamp===
Mellencamp's 1991 album, ''[[Whenever We Wanted]]'', was the first with a cover billed to John Mellencamp; the "Cougar" was finally dropped for good. ''Whenever We Wanted'' yielded the Top 40 hits "Get a Leg Up" and "Again Tonight," but "Last Chance," "Love and Happiness," and "Now More Than Ever" all garnered significant airplay on rock radio.

<blockquote>"It's very rock 'n' roll. I just wanted to get back to the basics." - John Mellencamp</blockquote>

In 1993, he released ''[[Human Wheels]]'', and the title track peaked at No. 48 on the ''Billboard'' singles chart. "To me, this record is very urban," Mellencamp told Billboard magazine of ''Human Wheels'' in the summer of 1993.

<blockquote>"We had a lot of discussions about the rhythm and blues music of the day. We explored what a lot of these (current) bands are doing – these young black bands that are doing more than just sampling." - John Mellencamp</blockquote>

Mellencamp's 1994 ''[[Dance Naked]]'' album included a cover of [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Wild Night]]" as a duet with [[Meshell Ndegeocello]]. "Wild Night" became Mellencamp's biggest hit in years, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album also contained two protest songs in, "L.U.V." and "Another Sunny Day 12/25", in addition to the title track, which hit No. 41 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1994.

<blockquote>"This is as naked a rock record as you're going to hear. All the vocals are first or second takes, and half the songs don't even have bass parts. Others have just one guitar, bass, and drums, which I haven't done since ''American Fool''."</blockquote>

With guitarist Andy York now on board as Larry Crane's full-time replacement, Mellencamp launched his Dance Naked Tour in the summer of 1994 but had a minor heart attack after a show at Jones Beach in New York on August 8 of that year. That heart attack eventually forced him to cancel the last few weeks of the tour. He returned to the concert stage in early 1995 by playing a series of dates in small Midwestern clubs under the pseudonym Pearl Doggy.

In September 1996, the experimental album ''[[Mr. Happy Go Lucky]]'', which was produced by [[Junior Vasquez]], was released to critical acclaim.

<blockquote>"It's been fascinating to me how urban records use rhythm and electronics, and it's terribly challenging to make that work in the context of a rock band. But we took it further than an urban record. The arrangements are more ambitious, with programs and loops going right along with real drums and guitars."</blockquote>

''Mr. Happy Go Lucky'' spawned the No. 14 single "[[Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)]]" (Mellencamp's last Top 40 hit) and "Just Another Day," which peaked at No. 46.

===1998–2003: Recording for Columbia===
[[File:Mellencamp sept2000.JPG|thumb|Mellencamp performing in 2000]]
After the release of ''Mr. Happy Go Lucky'' and a subsequent four-month tour from March to July 1997 to promote it, Mellencamp signed a four-album deal with [[Columbia Records]], although he wound up making only three albums for the label.

Issued a day before his 47th birthday in 1998, his [[John Mellencamp (album)|self-titled debut]] for Columbia Records included the singles "Your Life Is Now" and "I'm Not Running Anymore," along with standout album tracks such as "Eden Is Burning," "Miss Missy," "It All Comes True" and "Chance Meeting at the Tarantula". The switch in labels coincided with Dane Clark replacing Aronoff on drums. "On this record, we ended up quite a bit away from where we started," Mellencamp told Guitar World Acoustic in 1998.

<blockquote>"Initially, I wanted to make a record that barely had drums on it. Donovan made a record (in 1966), ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'', and I wanted to start with that same kind of vibe—Eastern, very grand stories, fairy tales."</blockquote>

In 1999, Mellencamp covered his own songs as well as those by Bob Dylan and [[the Drifters]] for his album ''[[Rough Harvest]]'' (recorded in 1997), one of two albums he owed Mercury Records to fulfill his contract (the other was ''[[The Best That I Could Do]]'', a best-of collection). In May 2000, he gave the Indiana University commencement address, in which he advised graduates to "play it as you feel it!" and that "you'll be all right." Following the delivery of his address, Indiana University bestowed upon him an honorary Doctorate of Musical Arts.

In August 2000, Mellencamp played a series of unannounced free concerts in major cities on the East Coast and in the Midwest as a way of giving back to fans who had supported him the previous 24 years. With a lo-fi setup that included portable amps and a battery-powered P.A. system, Mellencamp, armed with an acoustic guitar and accompanied only by an accordionist and a violist, dubbed the jaunt "Live in the Streets: The Good Samaritan Tour." At these dozen shows, which ranged from 45 to 60 minutes, Mellencamp covered several rock and folk classics and sprinkled in a few of his own songs.

<blockquote>"Nobody's selling anything, there's no souvenirs—except what's in everybody's heart. Think about it: Isn't that where music started? To anybody who's said thank you to me, I say, 'You're very nice, but, really, thank you.'"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhAEAAAAMBAJ&q=Mellencamp%27s+Acoustic+Samaritans&pg=PA7-IA4|title=Mellencamp's Acoustic Samaritans|publisher=Billboard Magazine|date=August 26, 2000}}</ref></blockquote> In 2001, Mellencamp partnered with [[Turner Classic Movies]] to release a documentary of the tour on [[YouTube]].

In the early 21st century, Mellencamp teamed up with artists such as [[Chuck D]] and [[India.Arie]] to deliver his second Columbia album, ''[[Cuttin' Heads]]'' and the single "[[Peaceful World (John Mellencamp song)|Peaceful World]]". ''Cuttin' Heads'' also included a duet with [[Trisha Yearwood]] on a love song called "Deep Blue Heart".

<blockquote>"He played me this song, and he said, 'I kind of have an idea of like when [[Emmylou Harris]] sang on Bob Dylan's record, just kind of harmony all the way through.'" -Yearwood </blockquote>

Mellencamp embarked on the Cuttin' Heads Tour in the summer of 2001, before the album was even released. He opened each show on this tour with a cover of the [[Rolling Stones]]' "[[Gimme Shelter]]" and also played a solo acoustic version of the ''Cuttin' Heads'' track "Women Seem" at each show.

In October 2002, Mellencamp performed the [[Robert Johnson]] song "Stones in My Passway" at two benefit concerts for his friend, ''Billboard'' magazine editor-in-chief [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]], who died from a heart attack in 2002.

Columbia Records executives, who were in attendance at the benefit shows, were so impressed with Mellencamp's live renditions of "Stones in My Passway" that they convinced him to record an album of vintage American songs, which ultimately became ''[[Trouble No More]]''. The album was a quickly recorded collection of [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]] covers originally done by artists such as [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Son House]], [[Lucinda Williams]] and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. ''[[Trouble No More]]'' was released in 2003,  dedicated to Mellencamp's friend Timothy White, and spent several weeks at No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Blues Album charts. Mellencamp sang the [[Gospel music|gospel]] song "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" at White's funeral on July 2, 2002.

===2004–2007: ''Words and Music'' and ''Freedom's Road''===
Mellencamp participated in the [[Vote for Change]] tour in October 2004 leading up to the [[2004 U.S. Presidential election]]. That same month he released the two-disc career hits retrospective ''[[Words & Music: John Mellencamp's Greatest Hits]]'', which contained 35 of his radio singles (including all 22 of his Top 40 hits) along with two new tunes, "[[Walk Tall (John Mellencamp song)|Walk Tall]]" and "Thank You" – both produced by [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]] but written by Mellencamp.

In 2005, Mellencamp toured with [[Donovan]] and [[John Fogerty]]. The first leg of what was called the Words and Music Tour in the spring of 2005 featured Donovan playing in the middle of Mellencamp's set. Mellencamp would play a handful of songs before introducing Donovan and then duetting with him on the 1966 hit "Sunshine Superman". Mellencamp would leave the stage as Donovan played seven or eight of his songs (backed by Mellencamp's band) and then return to finish off his own set after Donovan departed. On the second leg of the tour in the summer of 2005, Fogerty co-headlined with Mellencamp at outdoor amphitheaters across the United States. Fogerty would join Mellencamp for duets on Fogerty's [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] hit "Green River" and Mellencamp's "Rain on the Scarecrow".

Mellencamp released ''[[Freedom's Road]]'', his first album of original material in over five years, on January 23, 2007. He intended for ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' to have a 1960s rock sound while still remaining contemporary, and he feels that goal was achieved.

<blockquote>"We wanted to make sure that it had the same feeling of some of the great songs from the '60s but also had the message of today and had the backbeat of today. I think we came up with a pretty timeless-sounding album".</blockquote>

"Our Country," the first single from ''[[Freedom's Road]]'', was played as the opening song on Mellencamp's 2006 spring tour, and the band that opened for him on that tour, [[Little Big Town]], was called on to record harmonies on the studio version of "Our Country", as well as seven other songs on ''Freedom's Road''.

Although Mellencamp had always been outspoken and adamant about not selling any of his songs to corporations for commercial use, he changed his stance and let Chevrolet use "Our Country" in Chevy Silverado TV commercials that began airing in late September 2006.

<blockquote>"I agonized. I still don't think we should have to do it, but record companies can't spend money to promote records anymore, unless you're [[U2]] or [[Madonna]]. I'm taking heat because no one's ever done this before. People have licensed songs that have already been hits, but nobody's licensed a brand-new song to a major company, and people don't know how to react."</blockquote>

Mellencamp sang "Our Country" to open Game 2 of the [[2006 World Series]], and the song was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance category but lost to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "Radio Nowhere." ''Freedom's Road'' peaked at No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart by selling 56,000 copies in its first week on the market.

===2008–2013: The T Bone Burnett Era===
On August 13, 2007, Mellencamp began recording his 18th album of original material, titled ''[[Life, Death, Love and Freedom]]''. The album, released on July 15, 2008, was produced by [[T Bone Burnett]]. The first song with video, "Jena," was introduced on Mellencamp's website in October 2007. In an interview with the ''Bloomington Herald-Times'' in March 2008, Mellencamp dubbed ''[[Life, Death, Love and Freedom]]'' "The best record I've ever made." He signed with [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] label to distribute the album and said, "They think it's a fucking masterpiece." The album's first single was "My Sweet Love". A video for the song was filmed in Savannah, Georgia, on June 9, 2008. Karen Fairchild of [[Little Big Town]] is featured in the video. She harmonizes with Mellencamp on "My Sweet Love". She also provides background vocals to three other songs on ''Life, Death, Love and Freedom'', which became the ninth Top 10 album of Mellencamp's career when it debuted at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] the week of August 2, 2008. Like ''Freedom's Road'', ''Life, Death, Love and Freedom'' sold 56,000 copies in its first week. In its list of the 50 best albums of 2008, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine named ''Life, Death, Love and Freedom'' No. 5 overall and also dubbed "Troubled Land" No. 48 among the 100 best singles of the year.

[[File:Mellencamp-Crow.jpg|200px|right|thumb|John Mellencamp and Sheryl Crow perform Mellencamp's 2008 single "My Sweet Love" in the [[Hunter Region]], [[New South Wales]], Australia on November 29, 2008.]]
On September 23, 2008, Mellencamp filmed a concert at the Crump Theatre in Columbus, Indiana, for a new A&E Biography series called ''Homeward Bound''. The show featured performers returning to small venues where they performed early in their careers. The program aired on December 11, 2008, and featured an in-depth documentary tracing Mellencamp's roots.

Mellencamp participated in a tribute concert for [[Pete Seeger]]'s 90th birthday on May 3, 2009, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, which raised funds for an environmental organization founded by Seeger to preserve and protect the [[Hudson River]]. Mellencamp performed solo acoustic renditions of Seeger and Lee Hays' "[[If I Had a Hammer]]" and his own "A Ride Back Home."

While he was on tour, Mellencamp recorded a new album titled ''[[No Better Than This]]'' that was again produced by [[T Bone Burnett]]. The tracks for the album were recorded at historic locations, such as the [[First African Baptist Church (Savannah, Georgia)|First African Baptist Church]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]] as well as at the [[Sun Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and the Sheraton [[Gunter Hotel]] in [[San Antonio]] where blues pioneer [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] recorded "Sweet Home Chicago" and "Crossroad Blues". Mellencamp recorded the album using a 1955 [[Ampex]] portable recording machine and only one microphone, requiring all the musicians to gather together around the mic. The album was recorded in mono. Mellencamp wrote over 30 songs for the record (only 13 made the final cut), and he wrote one song specifically for Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel Mellencamp told the ''San Antonio Express-News'':

{{cquote|"It's called 'Right Behind Me.' I wrote it just for this room. I could have done this in my studio. But I want to do it this way, and if I can't do what I want at this point, I'm not going to do it. If it's not fun, I'm not going to do it. I'm through digging a ditch."}}  ''[[No Better Than This]]'' was released on August 17, 2010, and peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], becoming the 10th Top 10 album of his career. ''No Better Than This'' is the first mono-only release to make the top 10 since [[James Brown]]'s ''Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal'', which peaked at No. 10 in April 1964.

On December 6, 2009, Mellencamp performed "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]" as a tribute to Bruce Springsteen, who was one of the honorees at the 2009 [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. "I was very proud and humbled to have been able to play 'Born in the U.S.A.' in a different fashion that I think was true to the feelings that Bruce had when he wrote it, "Mellencamp said. He performed "Down by the River" on January 29, 2010, in Los Angeles in tribute to [[Neil Young]], who was honored at the 20th annual MusiCares Person of the Year gala. Mellencamp sang the hymn "[[Keep Your Eyes on the Prize]]" at "In Performance at the White House: A Celebration of Music from the Civil Rights Movement" on February 9, 2010.

Mellencamp, who co-headlined 11 shows in the summer of 2010 with [[Bob Dylan]], launched the ''No Better Than This'' theater tour on October 29, 2010, in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. On this tour, which ran through the summer of 2012 and covered the entire United States, Canada, and much of Europe, Mellencamp opened each concert with a showing of a Kurt Markus documentary about the making of ''No Better Than This'' called "It's About You" before hitting the stage to play three different sets: a stripped-down acoustic set with his band, a solo acoustic set, and a fully electrified rock set. "It'll be like [[Alan Freed]], like the old Moondog shows," Mellencamp told Billboard magazine prior to the tour: {{cquote|"When you went to see his shows, there was a movie like ''The Girl Can't Help It'' or something, and then three or four bands played. I'm gonna come out and play with upright bass and cocktail [drum] kits and a lot of acoustic instruments. I'll play for, like, 40 minutes that way. Then the band will leave and it'll just be me with an acoustic guitar for 40 minutes, and then there'll be 40 minutes of rock 'n' roll. You'll get three different types of John Mellencamp, and you'll get a movie."}} Mellencamp played for over two hours and included 24 songs on his tour's setlist. He brought the ''[[No Better Than This]]'' tour to Europe in the summer of 2011, opening in [[Copenhagen]] on June 24. One reviewer called the opening gig of the European leg of the tour "maybe the best rock performance ever in Denmark."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.torbenbille.dk/kritik/mellencamp-absolut-live/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624161204/http://www.torbenbille.dk/kritik/mellencamp-absolut-live/|url-status=dead|title=Mellencamp absolut live &#124; MIDT I EN BEATTID|archive-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> The ''[[No Better Than This]]'' Tour returned to the U.S. for one final round of shows from October 25 to November 19, 2011.

Mellencamp took part in two [[Woody Guthrie]] tribute concerts in 2012 as part of a year-long celebration surrounding the 100th anniversary of the folk icon's birth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/story/2012-03-07/john-mellencamp-woody-guthrie-centennial/53406198/1|title=Guthrie's 'Land' was Mellencamp's land of inspiration|work=USA Today | date=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

On July 8, 2014, Mellencamp released a new live album called ''[[Performs Trouble No More Live at Town Hall]]'' without any advance notice. The album captures his live performance at Town Hall in New York City on July 31, 2003, in which he performed every track from his 2003 ''[[Trouble No More]]'' covers album in addition to a rendition of "Highway 61 Revisited" by [[Bob Dylan]] and reworked versions of three of his own songs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.directcurrentmusic.com/dc-music-news-feed/2014/5/13/john-mellencamp-to-drop-live-trouble-no-more-in-july-new-stu.html |title=John Mellencamp to Drop Live 'Trouble No More' in July, New Studio LP for Fall |date=May 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529163413/http://www.directcurrentmusic.com/dc-music-news-feed/2014/5/13/john-mellencamp-to-drop-live-trouble-no-more-in-july-new-stu.html |archive-date=May 29, 2014}}</ref> Two songs performed at the 2003 Town Hall concert, the 1962 [[Skeeter Davis]] hit "The End of the World" and the traditional folk song "House of the Rising Sun", did not make the final track list despite the album's official press release stating that the CD and digital versions "feature the complete 15-song concert."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mellencamp.com/news.html?n_id=2080|title=Trouble No More Live at Town Hall Debuts July 8th | date=June 17, 2014}}</ref>

===2014–2018: ''Plain Spoken'', ''Sad Clowns & Hillbillies'' and ''Other People's Stuff''===
In October 2013, Mellencamp revealed that he was working on a new album, and he offered this update on the project to the ''Minneapolis Star-Tribune'':

<blockquote>"I've had a couple rehearsals with the band, and T Bone [Burnett] and I go in the studio in January. I'm not part of the music business. I want to write my songs, do some little shows."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/229174071.html|title=Ghost writers: Mellencamp and King scare up a musical|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune | date=October 25, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

A short time later, Mellencamp told ''Rolling Stone'':

<blockquote>"I've got a notebook with 85 new songs that I've written for my next record. T Bone Burnett is going to come out to Indiana sometime in early January and we're gonna go into the studio for however long it takes to make a new album.

In January 2014, Mellencamp began recording the project, which would ultimately be titled ''[[Plain Spoken]]'' and would become his 20th album of original material and 22nd studio album overall.

Outside of the Plain Spoken Tour, Mellencamp's most noteworthy live performance in 2015 came on February 6, when he paid tribute to Bob Dylan at the annual [[MusiCares]] Person of the Year event by performing a piano-and-vocal rendition of "Highway 61 Revisited" (Troye Kinnett from Mellencamp's band played the piano).

''[[USA Today]]'' wrote:<blockquote>"The musical high point in a night of many highlights was probably John Mellencamp's interpretation of 'Highway 61 Revisited;' with a vocal tone and timbre that channeled Tom Waits,' he made this usually scorching rocker into a blues dirge.

After a star-studded lineup paid tribute to Dylan with cover versions of some of his greatest songs, Dylan closed the evening with a 30-minute speech that included a reference to Mellencamp's 2008 song "Longest Days".

Dylan said: <blockquote>"And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing{{endash}}because John sang some truth today{{endash}}'one day you get sick and you don't get better.'

On February 27, 2020, Mellencamp's official social media accounts confirmed that he was currently recording an album at his Belmont Mall recording studio. In a September 2020 interview, Mellencamp guitarist Andy York said that ten songs have already been recorded and mixed for the album. However, a planned final session in April 2020 to complete the project was scuttled because of the [[COVID-19]] pandemic. During the pandemic, Mellencamp wrote at least 15 songs. The album was scheduled for release in 2020, but the pandemic pushed its release time frame back indefinitely.<ref name="YouTube">Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/3QuTxBXinzc Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20201203040850/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QuTxBXinzc Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite magazine|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QuTxBXinzc&t=7717s|title=Andy York Interview, John Mellencamp lead guitarist|magazine=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

I sang a little bit on his record."<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite magazine|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bruce-springsteen-2022-tour-collaborations-john-mellencamp-the-killers-1182151/ |title=Bruce Springsteen Plots 2022 Tour, Collaborations With John Mellencamp, the Killers |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

Mellencamp released a CD and documentary of his 2000 Good Samaritan Tour, which consisted of free lunchtime concerts in city parks, on August 27, 2021. The documentary is narrated by [[Academy Award]] winning actor [[Matthew McConaughey]], who is an avowed Mellencamp fan.<ref name="Welcome"/>

On September 29, 2021, Mellencamp released the audio and music video for "Wasted Days," a duet with Springsteen, as the lead single from ''[[Strictly a One-Eyed Jack]]''.<ref name="Billboard3">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/music/news/bruce-springsteen-joins-john-mellencamp-on-contemplative-e2-80-98wasted-days-e2-80-99/ar-AAOXflX?ocid=BingNewsSearch|title=Bruce Springsteen Joins John Mellencamp on Contemplative 'Wasted Days'|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> Written and produced solely by Mellencamp, "Wasted Days" is a song about aging and making the most of the time one has left. The album's second single, "Chasing Rainbows," was released on December 10, 2021. ''[[Strictly a One-Eyed Jack]]'' was released on January 21, 2022.

Mellencamp stated in 2021 that he had booked 80 shows for 2022, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic ultimately caused him to cancel his 2022 Strictly a One-Eyed Jack tour and push it until 2023.

<blockquote>"I'm gonna err on the side of caution. I do not want some guy walking up to me going, ‘Hey John, I saw you in Detroit' or something, ‘it was a great show except my wife got COVID and died.' Just the thought of hearing that…The business side of my career is like, ‘This many people will see it! You can make this much money!' Blah, blah, blah. But once this latest round of COVID hit I said, ‘Guys, what's the difference — this year, next year? There's no difference.' So next year, hopefully, we'll be on top of (the pandemic) and it'll feel alright to go out."<ref name="Billboard Magazine">{{cite magazine|url= https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/john-mellencamp-interview-1235027029/ |title=John Mellencamp on Working With Springsteen & Whether He'd Sell His Song Catalog |magazine=Billboard}}</ref></blockquote>

Mellencamp has also stated that he's already working on the follow-up to ''Strictly a One-Eyed Jack''.

<blockquote>"I'm already writing songs for another record, so that's how far ahead I am," Mellencamp said. "I'm talking to you about a record (''Strictly a One-Eyed Jack'') that's been done for about a year and a half, so I'm already on to my new songs — not as a job, just as they come. I can tell you there's a couple good songs already that I thought, ‘Wow, did I write that fuckin' song?!' So that's encouraging."<ref name="Billboard Magazine"/></blockquote>

Some of the songs that may be on Mellencamp's next album are leftovers from ''Strictly a One-Eyed Jack''. "The album is really about one guy, just one guy's voice speaking about his life," Mellencamp explains, speaking of ''Strictly a One-Eyed Jack''. "When I put it together it felt like [[John Huston]] sent me all these songs. And I wrote quite a few songs for this record, and some of the songs didn't have his voice, didn't have the feeling that this record has. So they were eliminated, and it didn't take me long to make that decision. I'd walk in and the guys in the band would look at me and go, ‘Not the same guy talking,' so we'd just move on to another song. But some of those songs we didn't record were pretty good, too."<ref name="Billboard Magazine"/>

In the summer of 2022, Mellencamp confirmed through his social media channels that he is, indeed, working on the follow-up to ''Strictly a One-Eyed Jack''. On August 24, 2022, he shared the lyrics to a brand new song called "The Eyes of Portland" – a diatribe against homelessness that will be on the new record.<ref name="JohnMellencamp.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.mellencamp.com/news/mellencamp-returned-to-the-studio-to-finish-recording-his-26th-album-this-summer |title=Mellencamp Returned To The Studio To Finish Recording His 26th Album This Summer|website=Mellencamp.com|date=August 25, 2022 }}</ref>

During a performance in his hometown of Seymour, Indiana, on September 17, 2022, to benefit the Southern Indiana Center for the Arts, Mellencamp revealed the new record's title to be ''Orpheus Descending''. "The name of the new record is ''Orpheus Descending,''" Mellencamp told the audience. "Do you guys know who [[Orpheus]] was? He was a Greek god that came down, and he was the best singer, the best songwriter, and men wanted to be like him and girls wanted to be with him. What happened was the girl he fell in love with got sent to Hades, he went down and met with the devil, and bad things happened......You can read about Orpheus in Greek mythology."<ref name="Seymour Tribune">{{cite news|url= https://tribtown.com/2022/09/21/mellencamp-performs-first-public-concert-in-seymour-since-1976/

''[[Orpheus Descending (album)|Orpheus Descending]]'', Mellencamp's twenty-fifth album, was released on June 16, 2023.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/orpheus-descending-mw0003974139 | title=John Mellencamp - Orpheus Descending Album Reviews, Songs & More &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref> Mellencamp launched a 78-date tour called "Live and in Person" on February 5, 2023, in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. The tour wrapped up on June 27 in [[Milwaukee]]. Mellencamp debuted "Hey God" and "The Eyes of Portland," two songs from ''Orpheus Descending'', in his 2023 live set. "Hey God" is the album's first single and was released on April 21, 2023, followed by "The Eyes of Portland" as the second single on May 12, 2023.

The Live and In Person tour marked the return of violinist [[Lisa Germano]] to Mellencamp's band. Germano played with Mellencamp from 1985-1993 before leaving in 1994 to pursue a solo career. Germano also played violin on ''Orpheus Descending'', marking the first Mellencamp studio album she has played on since 1993's ''[[Human Wheels]]''.

===Collaboration with George Green===
Mellencamp co-wrote several of his best-known songs with his childhood friend [[George Green (songwriter)|George Green]], who, like Mellencamp, was born and raised in Seymour, Indiana. Green contributed lyrics to numerous Mellencamp radio hits and classic album tracks, including "Human Wheels," "Minutes to Memories," "Hurts So Good," "Crumblin' Down," "Rain on the Scarecrow," "Your Life is Now,", and "Key West Intermezzo," in addition to songs recorded by Barbra Streisand, Hall & Oates, Jude Cole, Ricky Skaggs, Sue Medley, The Oak Ridge Boys, Percy Sledge, and Carla Olson.

Mellencamp and Green's final collaboration was "Yours Forever," a song that was included on the soundtrack to the 2000 movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]''. Mellencamp and Green had a falling out in the early 2000s, and Green ultimately moved from [[Bloomington, Indiana]] to [[Taos, New Mexico]] in 2001. "Like when you're married, when you're friends with somebody for a long time, the more things build up, the more things can go wrong," Mellencamp said in the liner notes to his 2010 box set, ''[[On the Rural Route 7609]]''. "There were personal problems, cross-pollinated with professional issues. George has written some great lyrics and we've written some great songs together, but I just couldn't do it any more."

On August 28, 2011, Green died in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] at the age of 59 after losing a battle with a rapid-forming small-cell lung cancer. "I've known George since we were in the same Sunday school class. We had a lot of fun together when we were kids. Later on, we wrote some really good songs together," Mellencamp told the ''Bloomington Herald Times'' shortly after Green's death. "George was a dreamer, and I was sorry to hear of his passing."<ref name="Bloomington Herald Times">[https://archive.today/20130103053512/http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/stories/2011/08/30/scene.qp-8782469.sto Songwriter, Mellencamp collaborator George Green dies at 59].

==Reception==
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' contributor [[Anthony DeCurtis]] said:
{{cquote|Mellencamp has created an important body of work that has earned him both critical regard and an enormous audience. His songs document the joys and struggles of ordinary people seeking to make their way, and he has consistently brought the fresh air of common experience to the typically glamour-addled world of popular music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/OCM/releases/melcamp.htm|title=Mellencamp to give IUB commencement address|publisher=Indiana University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402221158/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/OCM/releases/melcamp.htm|archive-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref>}}

In 2001, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine editor-in-chief [[Timothy White (writer)|Timothy White]] said:
{{cquote|John Mellencamp is arguably the most important roots rocker of his generation. … John has made [[fiddle]]s, [[hammer dulcimer]]s, [[Autoharp]]s ''(sic)'' and [[accordion]]s [into] lead rock instruments on a par with [[electric guitar]], bass, and drums, and he also brought what he calls 'a raw Appalachian' lyrical outlook to his songs. Mellencamp's best music is rock 'n roll stripped of all escapism, and it looks directly at the messiness of life as it's actually lived. In his music, mortality, anxiety, acts of God, questions of romance and brotherhood, and crises of conscience all collide and demand hard decisions. … This is rock music that tells the truth on both its composer and the culture he's observing.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhQEAAAAMBAJ&q=mellencamp+truck+stop+billboard&pg=PA105| title=Mellencamp Named 2001 Century Award Honoree |publisher=Billboard Magazine|date=July 14, 2001 |page=105}}</ref>}}

Former [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] frontman [[John Fogerty]] said of Mellencamp:

{{cquote|John is one of the great American songwriters and a great rock spirit. He's always been somewhat feisty, and his 'Authority Song' tells that story. But that's a good thing.

Country music star [[Keith Urban]] has consistently cited Mellencamp's influence on his music. It originated when Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee tour went to Australia in 1988 - Urban was in attendance at one of the concerts and described the experience as an "epiphany."<ref name="EW">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2005/12/02/how-keith-urban-became-star|title= How Keith Urban became a star |magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date=December 2, 2005}}</ref>

Urban told the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' in 2016: "For me, ''[[The Lonesome Jubilee]]'' was the defining record and tour. I've since gotten to know John a little bit, and it was one of the greatest opportunities I've ever had to meet a hero and tell him about a concert you went to when you were a nobody and how much of an effect that concert had on me... I was hit by lightning by that concert. I said to John, 'I didn't walk away thinking: I want to do that. I walked away feeling: I get it — just put all the things you love into what you do.'

Urban has covered numerous Mellencamp songs in his concerts over the years, including "Hurts So Good," "Jack and Diane," "Authority Song," and "Rumble Seat." In 2015, Urban and Mellencamp performed "Pink Houses" together twice during nationally televised events. Urban's 2015 hit single "[[John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16]]" further illustrated Mellencamp's influence on his music.

===Honors and awards===
Mellencamp has won one [[Grammy Award]] (Best Male Rock Performer for "Hurts So Good" in 1983) and has been nominated for 12 others. He has also been awarded the Nordoff-Robbins Silver Clef Special Music Industry Humanitarian Award (1991), the Billboard Century Award (2001), the Woody Guthrie Award (2003), and the ASCAP Foundation Champion Award (2007).

On September 9, 2010, Mellencamp received the [[Americana Music Association|Americana]] Lifetime Achievement Award in [[Nashville]]. On July 30, 2012, in San Jose, CA, Mellencamp was honored with the John Steinbeck Award, given to those individuals who exemplify the spirit of "Steinbeck's empathy, commitment to democratic values, and belief in the dignity of the common man."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mellencamp.com/news.html?n_id=1777|title=Mellencamp To Receive The John Steinbeck Award|date=May 16, 2023 |publisher=Mellencamp.com}}</ref>

On April 27, 2016, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ([[ASCAP]]) presented Mellencamp with its prestigious Founders Award at the 33rd annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards in Los Angeles. The ASCAP Founders Award goes to pioneering ASCAP songwriters who have made exceptional contributions to music by inspiring and influencing their fellow music creators. "For the last four decades, John Mellencamp has captured the American experience in his songs," said ASCAP President Paul Williams. "His infectious melodies and compassionate lyrics, wrapped in workingman's rock, crystallize life's joys and struggles and illuminate the human condition. A national treasure, he's also one of the truly great music creators that can make us care, move, clap, and sing along."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mellencamp.com/news.html?n_id=2570|title=John Mellencamp To Be Honored With Prestigious ASCAP Founders Award|date=May 16, 2023 |publisher=Mellencamp.com}}</ref>

==Other work==
===Acting===
Mellencamp has made several forays into acting over the years, appearing in four films: ''[[Falling from Grace (film)|Falling from Grace]]'' (which he also directed) (1992), ''[[Madison (film)|Madison]]'' (2005, narration only), ''After Image'' (2001), and ''[[Lone Star State of Mind (film)|Lone Star State of Mind]]'' (2002). His older brother, Joe Mellencamp, appears in ''Falling from Grace'' as the bandleader during the country club scene along with his band Pure Jam.

In 1980, Mellencamp turned down the lead role in the movie ''[[The Idolmaker]]'' because, as he told the ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' in 1983, "I was afraid that if I made too much money, I'd have no motivation to make records anymore."

Mellencamp told VH1 that he was originally offered the [[Brad Pitt]] role in ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'': "You know they used to want me to be an actor all the time, and I used to get more movie role offers. That's when I was – believe it or not, I used to not be as ugly as I am now. And they gave me this script called ''Thelma & Louise'' and they said, 'The guy wrote the part with you in mind, John; you really gotta do this part.' And I read the script and I thought, 'Yeah, I get it but I don't want to take my shirt off.' So Brad Pitt took his shirt off and look what happened to Brad Pitt. I was that close."<ref name=VH1>[http://vh1classicrocknights.com/2010/10/06/mellencamp-could%E2%80%99ve-been-a-movie-star/   Mellencamp could've been a movie star] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013031344/http://vh1classicrocknights.com/2010/10/06/mellencamp-could%E2%80%99ve-been-a-movie-star/ |date=October 13, 2010 }}.

===Film music composition===
Mellencamp wrote the score for the [[Meg Ryan]] movie ''[[Ithaca (film)|Ithaca]]'', which premiered on October 23, 2015, at the [[Middleburg Film Festival]] in Virginia and was released in theaters and on-demand by [[Momentum Pictures]] on September 9, 2016. "Not one note [in ''[[Ithaca (film)|Ithaca]]''] is anything other than Mellencamp. He did everything," said Ryan, Mellencamp's on-again, off-again girlfriend.<ref name="Deadline.com">{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2015/10/meg-ryan-directorial-debut-ithaca-tom-hanks-1201589998/|title= Meg Ryan Hits Film Festivals With Directorial Debut 'Ithaca' – And A Little Help From Tom Hanks: Q&A |magazine=Deadline Hollywood | date=October 21, 2015}}</ref>

In a May 6, 2016, Q&A after a screening of the movie at [[Geena Davis]]' Bentonville Film Festival, Ryan said: "The music is so beautiful. John Mellencamp wrote every note – everything – the tiny little needle drops you hear in the back. He wrote about half of it after I read him the script, and then the next half after he saw the movie. He's just incredible."<ref name="Entertainment Weekly">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/07/meg-ryan-ithaca-directorial-debut-bentonville|title= Meg Ryan finds a 'place at the table' with directorial debut Ithaca |magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date=May 7, 2016}}</ref>

In addition to the score, Mellencamp wrote two original songs for ''[[Ithaca (film)|Ithaca]]'': "Sugar Hill Mountain" (sung by [[Carlene Carter]]) and "Seeing You Around" (sung by [[Leon Redbone]]). "Sugar Hill Mountain" is a fiddle-driven folk song that describes an idyllic location where there are "bubble gum and cigarette trees," no clocks, every day is spring, and anything you need is "gratis." (The song would later be included, in a re-recorded version, on Mellencamp's 2017 album ''[[Sad Clowns & Hillbillies]]''.) Meanwhile, the piano-heavy "Seeing You Around" has the sound of a 1940s standard (the movie takes place during [[World War II]]) and is made all the more authentically '40s-sounding by Redbone's gruff baritone vocals. Mellencamp's band provided the backing on both tracks and performed all the music in the movie.

Said Carter in 2015:

<blockquote>"The way John Mellencamp and I met was he invited me to come and sing this song he had written for the movie that Meg Ryan has coming out called ''[[Ithaca (film)|Ithaca]]''. That was when we became friends, when I went to Indiana and recorded with him and the guys this really cool song called 'Sugar Hill Mountain' that's in the movie. And the movie is wonderful. We got to see a rough cut of it and I was very impressed."<ref name="Songfacts">{{cite news|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/carlene_carter/|title= Carlene Carter Interview |publisher=Songfacts | date=April 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

The film ''The Legend of Jack and Diane'' began production in Los Angeles in January 2022; according to film news website Deadline Hollywood, the makers were inspired by Mellencamp's song "Jack & Diane" and are in talks with Mellencamp's team about music for the film.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=D'Alessandro|first1=Anthony|date=December 14, 2021|title=Tom Sizemore Joins Female Revenge Thriller 'The Legend Of Jack And Diane'|url=https://deadline.com/2021/12/tom-sizemore-joins-female-revenge-thriller-the-legend-of-jack-and-diane-1234891130/|access-date=January 24, 2022|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Musical theater===
Mellencamp began working on a musical with [[Horror fiction|horror]] author [[Stephen King]], titled ''[[Ghost Brothers of Darkland County]]'', in 2000. The musical debuted in the spring of 2012 at Alliance Theatre in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where it ran from April 4 through May 13. A CD/DVD deluxe edition featuring the dialog, soundtrack, handwritten lyrics, and a mini-documentary about the making of the musical was released on June 4, 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/john-mellencamps-musical-with-stephen-king-nearing-completion-20121114 |title=John Mellencamp's Musical With Stephen King Nearing Completion  |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 14, 2012 |access-date=November 14, 2012}}</ref> Production on the musical's recorded soundtrack began on June 15, 2009, when [[T Bone Burnett]], who served as the project's musical producer, began laying down tracks in Los Angeles for the songs Mellencamp wrote for the project. The soundtrack includes [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Ryan Bingham]], [[Will Dailey]] and [[Neko Case]] among others singing the songs Mellencamp wrote.

In November 2010, Mellencamp told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'':{{cquote|"T Bone and I and Stephen King are working on a musical. All the music has been recorded. We had Kris Kristofferson, Neko Case, Elvis Costello, and Taj Mahal, all singing different characters' roles. I wrote all the songs, 17 songs. (T Bone) produced. It sounds like the 'Sgt. Pepper' of Americana to me. Forget about the play, just the songs, the way these people sing them. I'm sitting there listening to it and thinking, "Did Rosanne Cash just kill that song or what!" The play is called "Ghost Brothers of Darkland County", about two brothers who hate each other. If you could imagine Tennessee Williams meets Stephen King. They're recording the dialogue now and we're putting out a record of the entire show before it comes out. Right now, Elvis Costello, Meg Ryan, Kris Kristofferson and Matthew McConaughey are doing table readings like an old radio play. So you'll get all the dialogue, all the sound effects, and all the songs sung by different people so you can follow the story. The CD will come out ahead of time. So many people are involved, it's taken a long time. But we don't have to worry about money or record companies – it's our own money we're putting into it, so we said, let's just make something beautiful."}}

Ryan D'Agostino of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' stated in a review of a New York rehearsal of ''Ghost Brothers of Darkland County'' in the fall of 2007, "Musicals aren't usually a guy thing. This one, though, is not only tolerable, it's good. It may be the first-ever musical written by men for men. There's no orchestra, just two twangy acoustic guitars, an accordion, and a fiddle. The songs are both haunting and all-American."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-100/ghostbrothers1007 |title=No. 88: 'Ghost Brothers of Darkland County,' a Musical for Men |magazine=Esquire |date=September 18, 2007 |access-date=April 16, 2012}}</ref>

The Alliance Theatre described the show as a "Southern Gothic musical fraught with mystery, tragedy, and ghosts of the past."

The official description of ''Ghost Brothers of Darkland County'' from the Alliance Theatre website:{{cquote|In the tiny town of Lake Belle Reve, Mississippi in 1957, a terrible tragedy took the lives of two brothers and a beautiful young girl. During the next forty years, the events of that night became the stuff of local legend. But legend is often just another word for lie. Joe McCandless knows what really happened; he saw it all. The question is whether or not he can bring himself to tell the truth in time to save his own troubled sons and whether the ghosts left behind by an act of violence will help him – or tear the McCandless family apart forever.}}

''Ghost Brothers of Darkland County'' received mixed reviews upon its initial run in Atlanta. The musical toured 20 U.S. cities as a "radio play" in the fall of 2013 and toured 18 more cities across the U.S. in the fall of 2014. In 2015, the show was further developed in London, although King and Mellencamp are no longer as actively involved: "Steve and I are taking a step back ... but if they called and said they needed a song, I would write one," Mellencamp told ''USA Today''.<ref name="USA Today"/>

In October 2018, it was announced that [[Broadway Licensing]] has redeveloped ''Ghost Brothers of Darkland County'' and made it available for worldwide licensing beginning in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Stephen-King-and-John-Mellencamp-Will-Redevelop-GHOST-BROTHERS-OF-DARKLAND-COUNTY-for-Licensing-20181022 |title=Stephen King and John Mellencamp Will Redevelop GHOST BROTHERS OF DARKLAND COUNTY for Licensing |website=Broadway World |date=October 22, 2018 |access-date=October 25, 2018}}</ref>

Mellencamp holds [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] views and is a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In 2003, Mellencamp became one of the first entertainers, along with [[Sheryl Crow]] and the [[Dixie Chicks]], to publicly oppose the [[Iraq War]], a stance that was unpopular at the time. Mellencamp revealed in a 2017 ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'' interview that some of his [[Conservatism|conservative]] fans booed him at [[concert]]s for criticizing President [[George W. Bush]]. He also expressed annoyance that the lyrics of his 1983 song "[[Pink Houses]]" were taken out of context and used as a [[Patriotism|patriotic]] anthem.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQzjaXYlERw |title=Sunday Profile: John Mellencamp |date=July 2, 2017 |language=en |access-date=2024-04-28 |via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Mellencamp released the song "To Washington" in 2003 amidst the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], which was critical of the war and the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 U.S. Presidential elections]]. He noted, "When the song first came out, I was in the car one day, and we were driving to the airport, and I had my kids with me, and a radio station was playing 'To Washington' and having callers call in", Mellencamp said. "Some guy comes on and says, 'I don't know who I hate the most, John Mellencamp or [[Osama bin Laden]].'"<ref>{{cite web| last=Elizabeth |first=Mary|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/music/int/2003/06/30/mellencamp/|title=Ain't that America? |work=Salon |date=June 30, 2003|access-date=June 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007085939/http://www.salon.com/ent/music/int/2003/06/30/mellencamp/ |archive-date=October 7, 2008}}</ref>

In an "Open Letter to America" on his website, Mellencamp stated:
{{cquote|The Governor of California was removed from office based on finance troubles. And yet, George W. Bush has lied to us, failed to keep our own borders secure, entered a war under false pretense, endangered lives, and created financial chaos. How is it that he hasn't been recalled?

On his 2007 album, ''[[Freedom's Road]]'', Mellencamp included a hidden track called "Rodeo Clown," which was a direct reference to [[George W. Bush]] ("The bloody red eyes of the rodeo clown").

In April 2007, Mellencamp performed for wounded troops at the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Medical Center]]. His original intent was to duet on the ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' track "Jim Crow" with singer and activist [[Joan Baez]]. Army officials barred Baez from performing, however. Mellencamp told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: {{cquote|They didn't give me a reason why she couldn't come. We asked why, and they said, 'She can't fit here, period.' Joan Baez is a 66-year-old woman and the sweetest gal in the world.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last= Greene|first=Andy|title=Walter Reed Welcomes Mellencamp, Snubs Baez and Rather|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=April 30, 2007}}</ref>}}

According to a February 8, 2008, [[Associated Press]] report, Mellencamp's camp asked that the campaign for presidential candidate Sen. [[John McCain]] stop using his songs, including "Our Country" and "[[Pink Houses]]," during their campaign events. McCain's campaign responded by pulling the songs from their playlist. Mellencamp's publicist, Bob Merlis, noted to the Associated Press: {{cquote|If [McCain is] such a true conservative, why [is he] playing songs that have a very populist pro-labor message written by a guy who would find no argument if you characterized him as an ardent leftist?}} Merlis also noted that the same songs had been used, with Mellencamp's approval, by [[John Edwards presidential campaign, 2008|John Edwards's campaign]]; in response, the McCain campaign ceased using the songs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mellencamp Music for McCain?

Mellencamp performed "Small Town" at a [[Barack Obama]] rally in [[Evansville, Indiana]] on April 22, the night of the [[2008 Pennsylvania Democratic presidential primary]]. Mellencamp also performed "Our Country" at a rally for [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on May 3, 2008. However, he never came out in support of either Obama or Clinton during the primaries. "Neither candidate is as liberal as he would prefer, but he's happy to contribute what he can," Merlis said.

On January 18, 2009, Mellencamp performed "Pink Houses" at [[We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial]].

Mellencamp supports [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2010, Mellencamp's music was used by the [[National Organization for Marriage]] at events opposing same-sex marriage. In response, Mellencamp instructed Merlis to pen a letter to NOM stating "that Mr. Mellencamp's views on same-sex marriage and equal rights for people of all sexual orientations are at odds with NOM's stated agenda" and requesting that NOM "find music from a source more in harmony with your views than Mr. Mellencamp in the future."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prop8trialtracker.com/2010/10/04/john-mellencamp-no-pink-houses-for-nom/|title=John Mellencamp: No "Pink Houses" for NOM|last=Perrin|first=Kathleen|date=October 4, 2010|work=Prop 8 Trial Tracker|publisher=[[Courage Campaign]]|access-date=October 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006185433/http://prop8trialtracker.com/2010/10/04/john-mellencamp-no-pink-houses-for-nom/|archive-date=October 6, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2020}}

In August 2020, Mellencamp released "A Pawn in the White Man's Game" to his website along with a video to [[YouTube]]. The song was a re-working of the 1964 [[Bob Dylan]] song "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" that reflected on the killing of [[Civil Rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]]. Mellencamp's version featured new lyrics that reflected the [[George Floyd protests|racial conflicts in the U.S.]] in the wake of the [[murder of George Floyd]] while in custody of [[Minneapolis]] police officers. The video, which included a warning that it might be seen as "inappropriate for some viewers," featured footage of protesters and police clashing violently in 2020 and 1968. YouTube eventually removed the video, claiming it violated their community guidelines. Along with the song and video, Mellencamp released the statement, "For my entire life I have seen the mistreatment of minorities in our country. We have gone too far with the shameful killing and genocide…from the Native Americans to where we find ourselves today. In my own way, I have tried to address these issues in song."<ref name="ABCNews">{{cite magazine|url= http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2020/8/27/john-mellencamp-posts-reworked-version-of-1964-bob-dylan-civ.html |title=John Mellencamp posts reworked version of 1964 Bob Dylan civil rights-themed protest song|magazine=ABC News}}</ref>

Since college, Mellencamp, with the exception of a continuing addiction to nicotine, has lived a drug- and alcohol-free lifestyle. In 1984, when asked about his views on drugs, he told Bill Holdship of ''[[Creem]]'' magazine, "If you want to stick needles in your arms, go ahead and fucking do it. You're the one that's going to pay the consequences. I don't think it's a good idea, and I sure don't advocate it, but I'm not going to judge people. Hell, if that was the case, you wouldn't like anyone in the music business because everyone's blowing cocaine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/john-cougar-pink-houses-in-the-midwest|title=John Cougar: Pink Houses In The Midwest|work=Creem Magazine}}</ref> 

Mellencamp had a minor heart attack after a show at Jones Beach in New York on August 8, 1994, which eventually forced him to cancel the last few weeks of his Dance Naked tour.

<blockquote>"I was up to 80 cigarettes a day. We'd finish a show and I'd go out and have steak and french fries and eggs at 4 in the morning and then go to sleep with all that in my gut. It was just a terrible lifestyle."</blockquote>

==Early years==
Jonathan Edwards was born John Evan Edwards on July 28, 1946, in Aitkin, Minnesota. At the age of six, he moved with his family to Virginia, where he grew up. At the age of eight, he began singing in church and learning to play piano by ear. While attending [[Fishburne Military School]], he began playing guitar and composing his own songs.<ref name="je">{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Donna |title=Jonathan Edwards Biography |publisher=Jonathan Edwards |url=http://www.jonathanedwards.net/general/presskit-biography.php |access-date=October 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104124900/http://www.jonathanedwards.net/general/presskit-biography.php |archive-date=November 4, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a teenager he began performing in front of audiences.
{{blockquote|I started on a $29 guitar and immediately started putting a band together, writing songs and learning all the contemporary folk songs of the time. I just loved it, loved everything about it, loved being in front of people playing music.<ref name="je"/>}}

While studying art at Ohio University, he became a fixture at local clubs, playing with a variety of rock, folk, and blues bands.<ref name="je"/>

==Career==
In 1967, he and his band moved to Boston and played clubs throughout New England. With [[Joe Dolce]] on lead guitar, they played cover tunes as well as their own country-blues originals under various names, including the Headstone Circus, St. James Doorknob, and the Finite Minds, and they made an album for [[Metromedia Records]] as Sugar Creek.<ref name="je"/>

In the early 1970s, Edwards left the band and began performing as a solo acoustic artist. He would later recall:
{{blockquote|I liked the sound of bronze strings on rosewood better than steel strings on magnets, and so I walked out of that club in Vermont, rented myself a van and PA system, and started traveling around the colleges in New England by myself, without gigs, just setting up in the lobbies of dormitories on a Saturday. Pretty soon I started getting a following.<ref name="je"/>}}

Edwards began opening for acts such as the [[Allman Brothers Band]] and [[B.B. King]]. He signed with [[Capricorn Records]] to record his first album, ''[[Jonathan Edwards (album)|Jonathan Edwards]]'' (1971).<ref name="allmusic"/> 
{{blockquote|We took about a year recording the first album—different times, different studios, different sounds, different techniques. Recording was so new in '69 and '70. There was a song on the album called 'Please Find Me', and for some reason the engineer rolled over it. It got erased. We spent hours looking for it. We fired the engineer and put "[[Sunshine (Jonathan Edwards song)|Sunshine]]" in its place.<ref name="je"/>}}

Like most of the songs on ''Jonathan Edwards'', "Sunshine" was written shortly after Edwards left the band. "I felt really fresh, really liberated," he later recalled. "I just went out in the woods every day with my bottle of wine and guitar, sat by a lake near Boston and wrote down all those tunes, day after day." Regarding the theme of "Sunshine", Edwards commented, "It was just at the time of the Vietnam War and Nixon. It was looking bad out there. That song meant a lot to a lot of people during that time—especially me."<ref name="je"/> "Sunshine" reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in January 1972.<ref name="golden-discs">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 292] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 }}</ref>

Following the release of his debut album, Edwards moved out of the city to a farm in western Massachusetts, which provided the rural, country inspiration for his second album, ''Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy'' on the [[Atlantic Records]] label. This was an album of mostly self-penned acoustic, country-flavored songs about love and life and was closely followed by ''Have a Good Time For Me'', also on Atlantic.<ref name="je"/>

In 1973 he and his friends got together to record a live album called ''Lucky Day'', named after a song he wrote in the truck on his way up to live in Nova Scotia. This "fresh-air break" lasted only a couple of months when his friend [[Emmylou Harris]] invited him to Los Angeles to sing backup on her album ''[[Elite Hotel]]''. That led to a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and two albums produced by Harris' husband/producer [[Brian Ahern (producer)|Brian Ahern]]: ''Rockin' Chair'' and ''Sailboat''.<ref name="je"/>

In 1979, Edwards moved back to the United States to New Hampshire, and then two years later back to Northern Virginia area where he had grown up. In 1983, he produced and recorded ''Blue Ridge'' with the bluegrass band, [[The Seldom Scene]], for [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. Then in 1987 he recorded a children's album, ''Little Hands'', which was released on the small independent American Melody label. It was selected by the [[American Library Association]] as a Notable Children's Recording.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="je"/>

Turning to acting, Edwards toured as the lead in the Broadway musical ''[[Pump Boys and Dinettes]]''. When the show reached Nashville, he met an old friend from the folk circuit, Wendy Waldman.<ref name="Appleseed Edwards">{{cite web |url=http://www.appleseedmusic.com/jonathanedwards/ |title=Jonathan Edwards |publisher=Appleseed Recordings |access-date=2018-04-13 |archive-date=March 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310084604/http://www.appleseedmusic.com/jonathanedwards/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> She and Mike Robertson convinced Edwards to come to town and record a country album. "I've been making country-sounding records all my life, but never in Nashville. Yeah, let's do it." Edwards said. So, ''[[The Natural Thing (Jonathan Edwards album)|The Natural Thing]]'' was produced, recorded, and released on MCA/Curb Records in 1989. "I was crazy about the songs we selected from those great Nashville writers, and the acoustic-based production that Wendy and I put together was just a joy to make and to listen to. I count that as one of the best albums I've ever been involved with."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/de/music/Jonathan+Edwards/+wiki|title=Alter, Heimatstadt, Biografie von Jonathan Edwards|website=Last.fm|language=de|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>

In the 1990s, Edwards continued to tour, doing session work, and producing his own music as well as that of other talents, such as [[Cheryl Wheeler]] ("Driving Home," "Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar"). He took part in the 1994 "Back to the Future" tour that also included [[Don McLean]], [[Tom Rush]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Steve Forbert]] and [[Al Stewart]]. In 1994 he released ''One Day Closer'', his first solo album in five years, on his new record label, Rising Records. ''Man in the Moon'', which includes several of Edwards' original songs, followed the end of 1997. In September 1997, Rising Records released a remixed, re-sequenced ''Among Us'', a CD by [[Simon Townshend]], younger brother of the Who's [[Pete Townshend]]. Edwards also scored the soundtrack for ''The Mouse'', starring [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-mouse-1200447610/|title=The Mouse|last1=Harvey|first1=Dennis|date=1996-11-18|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>

In 2001, Edwards celebrated 30 years of "Sunshine" with a First Annual Farewell Tour with [[Kenny White]] on piano. In the 2000s, Edwards narrated and performed in a travel series for Media Artists entitled ''Cruising America's Waterways'',<ref>[http://www.cruisingamerica.com] {{dead link|date=July 2024}}</ref> which was purchased by PBS. Media Artists also released a companion album. Edwards participated in a second series, which started running on PBS-TV stations in May 2004.

In 2008, Edwards appeared in the romantic comedy film ''[[The Golden Boys]]'', starring [[Bruce Dern]], [[David Carradine]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Mariel Hemingway]], and [[Rip Torn]]. Set in Cape Cod in 1905, the film featured Edwards in the role of Reverend Perley. In addition to acting, Edwards scored the film.<ref name="je"/>

In the fall of 2012, he appeared with [[Michael Martin Murphey]] in a series of concerts throughout New England. He continues to tour both solo and with band members Tom Snow, Rick Brodsky, Rob Duquette and Joe K. Walsh.

Edwards lives in [[Portland, Maine]].

== Early life ==
Loggins was born in [[Everett, Washington]], the youngest of three brothers. His father, Robert George Loggins, was a salesman of [[English Americans|English]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] ancestry,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K934-J26| title=Kenny Loggins' parents on the 1940 US Census| website=[[FamilySearch]]}}</ref> while his mother, Lina (née Massie), was a homemaker of [[Italian Americans|Italian]] descent, from [[Avezzano]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.facebook.com/KennyLoggins/photos/a.10150344195468830/10153083669338830/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/58759123829/10153083669338830 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited| title=Something happens to your heart when you look into those little eyes...| publisher=Facebook| first=Kenny| last=Loggins| date=March 7, 2015| quote=This is family. 'La Familia,' as my Italian mama used to say.}}{{cbignore}}</ref> They lived in [[Detroit]] and [[Seattle]] before settling in [[Alhambra, California]]. Loggins attended [[San Gabriel Mission High School]], graduating in 1966. He formed a band, The Second Helping, that released three singles during 1968 and 1969 on [[Viva Records (U.S.)|Viva Records]]. [[Greg Shaw]] described the efforts as "excellent [[punk rock|punky]] [[folk music|folk-pop]] records" that were written by Loggins who was likely to be the bandleader and singer as well; Shaw included "Let Me In" on both ''[[Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2]]'' and the ''[[Pebbles, Volume 9 (CD)|Pebbles, Volume 9]]'' CD.<ref>Liner notes, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2. Ref. August 21, 2008.</ref>

Loggins had a short gig playing guitar for [[The Electric Prunes#The "New Improved" Electric Prunes|the New Improved Electric Prunes]] in 1969 before writing four songs for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] that were included on their album ''[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]''.<ref name=POEM>[http://www.poemhunter.com/lyrics/kenny-loggins/biography/ "Biography: Kenny Loggins"] Poem Hunter.com</ref> During his early 20s, he was in the band Gator Creek with [[Mike Deasy]]. The first recorded version of "[[Danny's Song]]" (later recorded by Loggins and Messina and a No. 7 Hot 100 hit for [[Anne Murray]] in 1973) was included on their only album, released on [[Mercury Records]].

== Loggins and Messina ==
[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Poco (band)|Poco]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he was introduced to Loggins, then a little-known singer-songwriter who was signed to [[ABC Records|ABC-Dunhill]].

The two recorded a number of Loggins's compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins (with Messina's help) to a six-album contract, recording began in earnest for Loggins's debut album, with Messina as producer. He assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning his old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante (both formerly of [[the Sunshine Company]], a disbanded 1960s group from Los Angeles), violinist/multireedist Al Garth and multireedist Jon Clarke. Keyboardist [[Michael Omartian]] also played on the album and despite dropping out at the start of the touring, continued to play keyboards on the next two albums. Los Angeles–based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]], described by Messina as an [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]], also contributed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's "Vahevala" |publisher=Mixonline |date=January 9, 2004 |access-date=November 1, 2015}}</ref>

Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. But by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation and vocals that an "accidental" duo was born. Thus the full name of their first album was ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored "Vahevala", found top 3 success on [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on May 18, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL – all hit music in the Midwest|date=May 18, 1972|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Kenny Loggins.jpg|thumb|A publicity photo, {{circa|1980}}]]
Although the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually found success by fall 1972, particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily. Loggins and Messina's vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity in itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo, Loggins & Messina.

''"When our first album, 'Sittin' In', came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales"'', Messina recalled in 2005.
{{Blockquote|text=We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, "You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest." He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one.<ref name="Thibodeaux">"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi", by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> }}

Both members of the duo were guitarists: Loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica and Messina played lead guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin and Dobro. Over the next four years they produced five more albums of original material in the studio, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Daryl Hall & John Oates]].<ref name="Thibodeaux" /> Their work also included [[Lynn Anderson]]'s "[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]", which was released in 1972 and reached No.&nbsp;4 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles]] chart, and "[[Danny's Song]]" and "[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]" for [[Anne Murray]], which reached No.&nbsp;7 and No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]] pop chart in 1973 and 1974 respectively.  The latter two songs also hit No.&nbsp;1 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart. Later studio albums often found Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record than as a genuine partnership. As they both noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition. Following their January 1976 release of ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'' and a final concert in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, on September 25, 1976, the pair amicably and quietly parted to pursue solo careers. A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released in November 1976. Two months later, a live album, ''[[Finale (album)|Finale]]'' was released, more by record company decision than one intended by the artists, one year after the duo had come to an end.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

== Solo career ==
[[File:Kenny Loggins 1977.jpg|thumb|Loggins performing in 1977]]
In 1977, Loggins produced his first solo album, ''[[Celebrate Me Home]]'', which included the successful song "[[I Believe in Love (Kenny Loggins song)|I Believe in Love]]", originally sung by [[Barbra Streisand]] in ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. ''[[Nightwatch (album)|Nightwatch]]'', a popular album released in 1978, included the hit song "Whenever I Call You Friend", a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], co-written with [[Melissa Manchester]]. Loggins followed that in 1979 with ''[[Keep the Fire]]'' and in 1982 with ''[[High Adventure]]''. The latter contained his rock duet with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] frontman [[Steve Perry (musician)|Steve Perry]], "[[Don't Fight It (Kenny Loggins & Steve Perry song)|Don't Fight It]]", which rose to No.&nbsp;17 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] chart. Loggins abandoned the harmonica in his solo career but continued to play guitar, just as he had done with Loggins & Messina.

=== With Michael McDonald ===
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2023}}
Loggins also co-wrote the song "[[What a Fool Believes]]" with [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]. Each recorded his own version of it, with McDonald recording as a member of [[the Doobie Brothers]]. Loggins' version was released first, but the Doobie Brothers' version achieved greater success, reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the Hot 100 and earning Loggins and McDonald the 1980 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].

In 1979, Loggins and McDonald wrote "[[This Is It (Kenny Loggins song)|This Is It]]". The song was a love song and ultimatum to a woman having an affair and stringing her lover along, while refusing to make a final decision.  The song earned Loggins the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. [[NBC]] used the song as theme music for its coverage of the [[NCAA men's basketball tournament]] in 1980 and 1981.

=== Soundtracks ===
During the next decade, Loggins recorded so many successful songs for film soundtracks that he became known as the King of the Movie Soundtrack.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/kenny-loggins "Kenny Loggins"] Gale Music Profiles</ref><ref>Franko, Vanessa: [http://www.pe.com/localnews/temecula/stories/PE_News_Local_D_loggins04.326bf83.html "Temecula film fest to honor Kenny Loggins"] ''Temecula Press-Enterprise'', August 3, 2010</ref> It began with "[[I'm Alright (Kenny Loggins song)|I'm Alright]]" from ''[[Caddyshack]]''.

Loggins also performed [[Nobody's Fool (Kenny Loggins song)|"Nobody's Fool"]] for the film ''[[Caddyshack II]]''. He performed as a member of [[USA for Africa]] on the famine-relief fundraising single "[[We Are the World]]", which led to an appearance performing "Footloose" at the Philadelphia leg of the July 13, 1985, [[Live Aid]] famine-relief dual-venue charity concert and global television broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liveaid.free.fr/ |title=The definitive LIVE AID site : all you wanted to know about the greatest concert on Earth |publisher=Liveaid.free.fr |access-date=June 25, 2014}}</ref>

During the 1990s, Loggins continued his album career, including the popular 1994 children's album ''[[Return to Pooh Corner]]'', which included the title single, a reworking of "[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]", written for his newborn son Luke.

In 1991, Loggins recorded and produced ''[[Leap of Faith (Kenny Loggins album)|Leap of Faith]]'', which included the single "[[Conviction of the Heart]]". Vice President [[Al Gore]] called this song "the unofficial anthem of the [[environmental movement]]". On [[Earth Day]] 1995, Loggins performed at [[The National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., before a live audience of 500,000.

In 1997, Loggins released the album ''[[The Unimaginable Life]]'', based on a book he co-wrote with his then-wife Julia. Tracks include "Now That I Know Love", "The Art of Letting Go" and "One Chance at a Time". The album was produced by Loggins and [[Randy Jackson]] with background vocals by [[Skyler Jett]], Lamont VanHook and Howard Smith.

In 1998, Loggins recorded a version of the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' song "One Small Voice" for the ABC television special ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', which was included as a track on the Grammy Award-winning [[Elmopalooza! (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].

'''Kristian Merrill Bush'''<!--middle name per BMI listings--> (born March 14, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Bush is one half of the [[country music]] duo [[Sugarland]] with [[Jennifer Nettles]], and was a member of the [[folk rock]] duo [[Billy Pilgrim (band)|Billy Pilgrim]] with [[Andrew Hyra]]. In addition to his work in these two groups, Bush released one solo album, ''[[Southern Gravity]]'', via [[Streamsound Records]] in 2015, and four solo albums via Big Machine Records, 52 ATL x BNA, 52 | In The Key Of Summer, 52 | New Blue, and 52 | This Year in 2022 and 2023. In 2023 Bush also released an EP titled Drink Happy Thoughts on his own label Songs Of The Architect.

==Early life==
Kristian Bush was born in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Bush was raised outside of Knoxville in [[Sevierville, Tennessee]], a small town at the base of the [[Smoky Mountains]] that was also the hometown of [[Dolly Parton]].<ref name="Emory Magazine">{{cite web|last=Parvin|first=Paige P.|title=Down in Sugarland| work= Emory Magazine|url= http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_MAGAZINE/2008/spring/sugarland.html|publisher=[[Emory University]]|access-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref> He is the great grandson of A.J.

During these early years, Bush, alongside younger brother Brandon, made his musical debut at the local Bush Beans Jamboree performing as Parton's opening act.<ref>{{cite web|last=Haynes|first=Beth|title=HomeGrown: Kristian and Brandon Bush, Sugarland|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/article/218352/2/HomeGrown-Kristian-and-Brandon-Bush-Sugarland|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141027140745/http://www.wbir.com/news/article/218352/2/HomeGrown-Kristian-and-Brandon-Bush-Sugarland|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 27, 2014|work=WBIR.com|access-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref> His grandparents made a "weird deal" when he was 12 and lost the Bush Brothers company, a deal they were ultimately bitter about, but it allowed Bush to grow up and be whatever he wanted.<ref name="TED"/>

Throughout childhood, Bush was enrolled in violin lessons and classically trained under the [[Suzuki method]] at the [[University of Tennessee]].<ref name="Emory Magazine" />  The family eventually relocated to Knoxville and by age 11, Bush agreed to play one season in the Knoxville Youth Symphony, before earning the right to lay the violin down for good and start learning the guitar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Testerman|first=Janet|title=Kristian Bush of Sugarland Cover Feature|url=http://www.umgnashville.com/artist/detail.aspx?nid=5055&aid=181|work=Knoxville Magazine|access-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref>  As a teenager, Bush stuck with the guitar and began to create original music. It wasn't long before he was writing his own songs and recording homemade albums.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Interview with Kristian Bush of Sugarland|url=http://www.epiphone.com/news-features/news/2005/an-interview-with-kristian-bush-of-sugarland.aspx| publisher= Epiphone| access-date= October 27, 2014}}</ref> He did swimmer electives throughout high school and college, and would write music in his head to the rhythm of his swimming strokes.<ref name="TCI"/>

Bush attended [[Avon Old Farms]] Boarding School in [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]], [[Connecticut]], graduating in 1988. He then attended [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]], earning a degree in Creative Writing.<ref name="Emory Magazine" />  During college, Bush began to connect with Atlanta's growing music scene, often begging his way into clubs, witnessing first-hand success from bands like [[R.E.M.]] and (fellow Emory students) the [[Indigo Girls]].<ref name="Emory Magazine" />

==Musical career==
[[File:Kristian Bush at Ramstein Air Base, Germany.jpg|thumb|Bush performing at the [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]] in 2008]]
While attending Emory University, Bush was the lead singer and guitarist in the rock band Storyteller, with fellow Emory students Chris "Tex" Nolter (bass, guitar) and Jon Slatkin (drums). Storyteller covered the Replacement's "I Can't Wait”, Rod Stewart's "Maggie May”, The English Beat's "Mirror in the Bathroom", and Jane's Addiction's "Jane Says”, among other songs, and they performed at numerous bars, campus events and parties in Atlanta.

To date, Bush has won six [[BMI Awards]] for his songwriting abilities, and in 2011 he founded the music publishing company and songwriting collective Songs of the Architect. Recent producing and songwriting collaborations include [[Ellis Paul]], [[Laura Bell Bundy]], [[Matt Nathanson]], [[The dB's|the dB’s]], Martin Johnson of [[Boys Like Girls]], [[Pretty Little Liars]] star [[Lucy Hale]], and up-and-comers including [[Kristina Train]], [[Larkin Poe]], [[Canaan Smith]], [[Lauren Alaina]], [[Jaida Dreyer]] and Alana Springsteen.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== 1990–2001: Billy Pilgrim ===
{{Main|Billy Pilgrim (band)}}
Shortly after completing college, Bush introduced himself to Atlanta songwriter [[Andrew Hyra]] and his sister Annie, who were performing at a club in Knoxville; the two had recently moved there after completing college. In 1990, Bush played guitar and sang backup vocals on ''Big Back Porch Songs'', an album by the Hyras. ''Big Back Porch Songs'' was never released but Bush was given a copy. Bush released an album shortly afterwards, ''Politics and Pocketchange'', which the Hyras were featured on.<ref name="BP">{{Cite web |url=http://www.billypilgrim.net/biography/index.html |title=Tunes, Technology, and Time Travel: a Billy Pilgrim Biography |access-date=October 26, 2023 |website=Trafalmadore |last=Zimmerman |first=Matthew|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071728/http://www.billypilgrim.net/biography/index.html |archive-date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="AMBP"/> Bush and Andrew Hyra began performing together using connections that Bush made from his time in Storyteller, writing original songs in the meantime. The Hyras had made plans for future performances, but Annie had accepted a job in [[Miami, Florida]]; Bush replaced her.<ref name="BP"/>

After a year of performing, the two drove to Knoxville where they rented two days of studio time, where they recorded 14 original songs, assisted by their producer Danny Browns. The two released their first album together in 1991, ''St. Christopher's Crossing'', independently under the credit Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush.<ref name="AMBP">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-pilgrim-mn0000770092 |title=Billy Pilgrim - Biography |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> They continued performing shows in southeastern college towns, and Bush reached out to various talent agents with their demos; Jen Stark, an intern at [[Atlantic Records]], recceived a copy, which resulted in commotion about them amongst the company. An indie label, Sister Ruby, expressed interest in the duo, and the two made another album for the label; it emphasized songs that weren't used for ''St. Christophers's Crossing'', which were quieter songs that couldn't be played in loud clubs.  The album was called ''Words Like Numbers''. Bush cited a large improvement between the two albums, because "with ''St. Christopher's'' we didn't think, we just did it.  This time we had several weeks to think about what we were recording."<ref name="BP"/> The album was a success in garnering attention; Atlantic Records held a release party for the two, and they were signed to the label that night,<ref name="BP"/> in New York.<ref name="TED"/> The duo name was officially changed to [[Billy Pilgrim (duo)|Billy Pilgrim]], named after a character from [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Billy Pilgrim Review |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268642485.pdf |last=Cook |first=Sean |date=February 17, 1994 |pages=2 |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]}}</ref><ref name="BP"/><ref name="TOCBP"/>

The duo released the self-titled album ''Billy Pilgrim'' in 1994, in association with producer [[Hugh Padgham]], who had a group of London musicians overdub the master with additional instruments.<ref name="BP"/><ref name="TOCBP">{{Cite web |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/kristian-bush-pre-sugarland-band-billy-pilgrim-lost-album-time-machine/ |title=Kristian Bush's Pre-Sugarland Album Band Billy Pilgrim Releasing Their Long Lost Album [Listen] |date=July 16, 2020 |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[Taste Of Country]] |last=Trapp |first=Phillip}}</ref> Although the album itself received little attention, "Get Me Out Of Here" and "Insomniac", two songs on the album were, receiving heavy airplay on AAA radio. In 1995 they opened on a worldwide tour for [[Melissa Etheridge]], but copies for ''Billy Pilgrim'' weren't made in time to be promoted throughout it.<ref name="BP"/> To increase their momentum, Atlantic Records made the two record another album in December 1994; unprepared, they scrambled to write new material two weeks ahead of the date of recording. They were paired with a group of veteran musicians who emphasized sounds that took away from their original music.<ref name="BP"/> Their second album, ''[[Bloom (Billy Pilgrim album)|Bloom]]'', released in 1995. The lead single "Sweet Louisiana Sound" was a critical and commercial success, making a full rotation on [[VH1]]. At their peak they "traveled all over the world together, just with two acoustic guitars and two voices."<ref name="BPRS">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/see-kristian-bush-reunite-his-nineties-folk-rock-band-billy-pilgrim-186979/ |title=See Kristian Bush Reunite His Nineties Folk-Rock Band Billy Pilgrim |date=January 22, 2016 |access-date=October 25, 2023 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Leahey |first=Andrew}}</ref>

Sales for ''Bloom'' were underwhelming, and with increasing focus on [[Hootie and the Blowfish]], Atlantic Records dropped the duo in 1996.<ref name="BP"/><ref name="RLM"/> The two toured sporadically, working on an album for a 1996 release, which never surfaced. Hyra moved to California but still kept in contact with Bush. Billy Pilgrim went silent temporarily as did Bush; he occasionally played at [[Eddie's Attic]], and did production work [[Ellis Paul]], Beth Wood, and [[Evan and Jaron]]. Bush announced the two were making separate solo albums in 1997, but such albums never released. Bush and Hyra collaborated for a "farewell" tour, and although they simply meant they were taking a hiatus, news spread they were disbanding.<ref name="BP"/>

==== 1999–2001: Billy Pilgrim hiatus ====
In 1999, Bush took interest in the newly developing format of online music distribution. He began releasing demos, outtakes, and live performances from Billy Pilgrim on the website [[MP3.com]]. He appreciated that he was able to release music easily without anyone else's approval. Bush partnered with MP3.com to release an old live performance of Billy Pilgrim at Eddie's Attic in 1998, ''Live from Wildhack, MT'', on the website. The performance also contained unreleased songs. Billy Pilgrim released ''Snow Globe'', a Christmas album, in November 1999, and ''9/23/00'', another live performance from Eddie's Attic, released towards the end of the year.<ref name="BP"/>

All the money earned from the downloads on MP3.com Bush used to fund the next album and its physical release. The album, ''Billy In the Time Machine'', was recorded in four separate sessions over the course of eight months. Bush cited [[U2]]{{'}}s ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and [[Thom Yorke]] as inspiration for the album. It was released May 12, 2001.<ref name="BP"/> The final works the two made together before unofficially disbanding were compiled into masters tapes. The tapes, as well as their studio, burned in a fire in late 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://magnetmagazine.com/2021/03/24/magnet-television-qa-with-kristian-bush-and-andrew-hyra-billy-pilgrim/ |title=Magnet Television: Q&A With Kristian Bush and Andrew Hyra (Billy Pilgrim) |date=March 24, 2021 |access-date=November 19, 2023 |website=[[Magnet Magazine]]}}</ref><ref name="BP"/> One copy was salvaged from the accident and made into a CD, of which 500 copies were made and distributed at their final performance in 2001 at [[Eddie's Attic]]. The band was never declared disbanded but the two lost contact with each other.<ref name="RLM">{{Cite web |url=https://www.redlightmanagement.com/artists/billy-pilgrim/ |title=Billy Pilgrim - Artist Bio |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=Red Light Management}}</ref>

=== 2001–2012: Sugarland ===

In the immediate aftermath of the collapse he, Nettles, and other crew downstairs were not allowed to leave; crew members attempted to leave but were kept from doing so. Bush was unaware of what happened and was kept in the dark for a long time. He was eventually evacuated to his bus but was forced to remain on the scene.

In years following, especially the immediate days following the event, Bush was discouraged from talking about the accident due to pending lawsuits. Sugarland cancelled one upcoming concert and performed two more, concluding the ''Incredible Machine Tour'' in October 2011.<ref name="TBISF"/>

Sugarland announced they would be going on hiatus for a few months to consider their next steps forward.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/sugarland-time-off-jennifer-nettles-solo-album/ |title=Sugarland to Take Time Off to Relax, Jennifer Nettles Considering Solo Album |date=November 10, 2011 |access-date=November 18, 2023 |website=[[Taste of Country]] |last=Dukes |first=Billy}}</ref> Bush returned home and continued working out the details of his pending divorce, finalizing it in November 2011. In light of the stage collapse and what talking about it publicly would mean for his children, he refrained from openly discussing the divorce as well.

The two agreed to put the band on hiatus indefinitely.

Bush was encouraged by the people around him to write a solo album. At first he was reluctant to do so, believing that doing so would hurt the image of Sugarland. [[Byron Gallimore]], Sugarland's producer, ensured him that since he was never the primary singer of the band, he wouldn't replace Sugarland on country radio. He began considering the venture, and looked through what songs he had written following the hiatus; he was surprised to find he had a collection of 300 recorded songs, and focused on what collection of songs he should release first.<ref name="TT"/> He began playing and writing for those he had worked with in the past, although they were reluctant to give him an opportunity because they did not know anything about how he performed separately; he realized then that the momentum from Sugarland would not carry over into his potential solo career.<ref name="TED"/>

===2013–2016: Solo career ===

In July 2013, after being drawn to the music and design of the mobile app ''[[My Singing Monsters]]'' while watching his son play, he expressed his praise of the game on [[Twitter]].

Two songs on the album, "Southern Gravity" and "[[Trailer Hitch]]", was written with Tim Owens; Owens said that given the kind of person that Bush is, and his talent of writing positive music, he was not surprised he could write happy songs that "sound marginally like Sugarland" despite him being in a dark place.<ref name="TT"/> Many songs from his backlog were shelved for being too sad and outside the scope of music he wanted to release.<ref name="RSSG">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/kristian-bush-on-joyous-new-lp-born-of-tragedy-its-sunshine-into-a-cave-63580/3/ |title=Kristian Bush on Joyous New LP Born of Tragedy: It's 'Sunshine Into a Cave' |date=April 2, 2015 |access-date=November 19, 2023 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Dunkerley |first=Neville}}</ref> The solo album consisted of feel-good music and lyrics; Bush himself admitted that he was unsure how that came to be given the circumstances.

After ''Southern Gravity'', Bush worked with [[Lindsay Ell]] to produce her debut EP, ''[[Worth the Wait (EP)]]'', mentoring her on her music endeavors.<ref name="TDSA"/> Also after ''Southern Gravity'', playwright Janece Shaffer reached out to Bush requesting that he write a song about a character for her playwright ''Troubadour''; set in 1951, it's about the life of fictional country star Billy Mason. The song, "Father to the Son", was another song he considered a "wish" as it reflected the relationship he wanted to have with his father.<ref name="TD"/> Shaffer requested a second song, so Bush wrote three songs to pick from; Shaffer used all three.

'''Roland Kent LaVoie''' (born July 31, 1943), better known by his stage name '''Lobo''' (which is Spanish for [[wolf]]), is an American singer-songwriter who was successful in the 1970s, scoring several U.S. Top 10 hits including "[[Me and You and a Dog Named Boo]]", "[[I'd Love You to Want Me]]", and "[[Don't Expect Me to Be Your Friend]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicvf.com/Lobo.art|title=Lobo Songs (Top Songs/Chart Singles Discography)|publisher=Musicvf.com|access-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref> These three songs, along with "[[Where Were You When I Was Falling in Love]]", gave Lobo four chart toppers on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening/Hot Adult Contemporary]] chart.

==Career==
===1961–1970: Early years===
Born in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], LaVoie was raised by his mother in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], with his six siblings. He began his musical career in 1961 as a member of a local band, The Rumours. The band included [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Jim Stafford]], as well as drummer Jon Corneal, who later joined Parsons's [[International Submarine Band]].<ref name=BandBoxRecords>{{cite web|url=https://kimsloans.wordpress.com/tag/lobo-with-the-rumours-1960s-band-with-gram-parsons/|title=Lobo with the Rumours|website=PopBopRocktilUDrop|date=6 March 2021}}</ref>

In 1964, while attending the [[University of South Florida]], LaVoie joined a band called the Sugar Beats<ref name=BandBoxRecords /> and met producer [[Phil Gernhard]]. He recorded a regional hit for the band, a cover of [[Johnny Rivers]]'s song, "What Am I Doing Here?"<ref name=BandBoxRecords />

During the 1960s, LaVoie performed with many other bands, including US Male, The Uglies, and Me and the Other Guys.<ref name=BandBoxRecords /> It was in the latter band that he met musician Billy Aerts, who became a member of Lobo's touring band in the early 1970s and produced Lobo's comeback album in 1989.

Again working with Gernhard, his first solo record was released in 1969 on [[Laurie Records]]. It included the original tracks "Happy Days in New York City" backed with "My Friend Is Here".

===1971–1975: Success with Big Tree===
By 1971, LaVoie had started calling himself Lobo (Spanish for [[wolf]]). Gernhard was an executive for [[Big Tree Records]], and the company released his first single, "[[Me and You and a Dog Named Boo]]", in March 1971.  The first major hit for the label, it reached No. 5 in the US and No. 4 in the UK by May, launching a successful series of singles. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] in September 1971.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

His debut album, ''Introducing Lobo'', came in  May 1971. In June his second single, "She Didn't Do Magic", was released. In September, "California Kid and Reemo" was released, followed by ''The Albatross''. When Big Tree Records merged with [[Bell Records]], Lobo's second project album ''Close Up'' was never released.

Under the Lobo alias, he then released ''Of a Simple Man'' in 1972, which included back-to-back U.S. Top 10 hits, including "[[I'd Love You to Want Me]]" (No. 2, November 18–25, 1972) and "[[Don't Expect Me to Be Your Friend]]" (No. 8, February 17–24, 1973).  The former became Lobo's biggest hit, a million-seller gaining gold disc status in November 1972<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> and internationally reaching No. 1 in Germany in December 1973 and No. 5 in the United Kingdom in July 1974.

With the release of ''Calumet'' in 1973, Lobo had three more [[Top 40]] hits: "It Sure Took a Long, Long Time", "[[How Can I Tell Her]]", and "Standing at the End of the Line". He made an appearance on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' that year. There were two further minor hit singles from the album: "There Ain't No Way" and "Love Me for What I Am".

In June 1974 Lobo's fourth album, ''Just a Singer'', was released. It was the first album by Lobo to contain tracks not written by him. The only single from the album was "Rings". "Don't Tell Me Goodnight" in 1975 became his last Top 30 single for Big Tree. Lobo also released the album, ''A Cowboy Afraid of Horses'', with "Would I Still Have You" released as a single. The label followed it up with a compilation album that year entitled ''The Best of Lobo''.

===1976–1985: Curb Records, and move to Nashville===
In 1976 Lobo broke away from Big Tree, releasing the album ''Come with Me'' in Europe on the [[Philips Records|Philips]] label.  "At First Sight" and "It's Everywhere" were the singles.  Neither was released in the US.

Lobo signed with [[Curb Records]] in 1977, releasing the single "Afterglow", co-produced by Lobo and Gernhard, and in 1978 "You Are All I'll Ever Need".  No full-length album materialized from these sessions.

In 1979 Lobo was signed to Curb/[[MCA Records]], where he worked with producer [[Bob Montgomery (musician)|Bob Montgomery]], releasing the single "Where Were You When I Was Falling in Love", which reached No. 23.  The song also reached No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.  He also released his first US album in four years, ''Lobo''. Other singles for Curb were "Holding On for Dear Love", "With a Love Like Ours", and "Fight Fire with Fire".

Reportedly dissatisfied with the production of his records, Lobo sought a release from his Curb contract.  He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and, in 1981, started his [[Private brand|own label]], Lobo Records, releasing several singles including "I Don't Want to Want You" (written by his brother, Roger LaVoie), "Come Looking for Me", and "Living My Life Without You", all of which charted in the country charts.  He also released "Bull Smith Can't Dance the Cotton Eye Joe" with the group Wolfpack, which included Narvel Felts and Kenny Earl.

Lobo Records was renamed Evergreen Records in 1985.  The label released two of his singles: "Am I Going Crazy" and "Paint the Town Blue", the latter a duet with Robin Lee.

===1987–present: Asian popularity and recent years===
Although he is far less followed now in the United States, Lobo's popularity grew in Asia, fanned by the release of his [[greatest hits]] compilations in 1987 and 1988. This encouraged him to release in 1989 his first new album in 10 years, entitled ''Am I Going Crazy''. It was recorded in [[Taiwan]] on UFO/WEA Records and was produced by Billy Aerts. He signed a multi-album deal with PonyCanyon Records in Singapore, and in 1994 released ''Asian Moon'', repackaging some of the tracks from ''Am I Going Crazy'' along with newly recorded material. His follow-up album ''Classic Hits'' in 1995 were re-recordings of Lobo hits and some [[cover version]]s. In 1996 he released the album ''Sometimes'', containing all new original songs.

On another Asian label, Springroll Entertainment, he released ''You Must Remember This'' in 1997, an album of [[pop standards]] that was released in two formats, one with vocals and the other with instrumental tracks.

In 2000, Lobo signed with a German record company, Gmbh Entertainment, and recorded a few tracks for various hits CDs. He also co-wrote two [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] with Billy Aerts, "A Big Kid's Christmas" and "Late Christmas Eve", which have been released on various Christmas compilations from 2000 to present. Singles recorded during this period include "[[Let It Be Me (The Everly Brothers song)|Let It Be Me]]", "Who'll Stop the Rain", and "Different Drum".

In 2006, based on his Asian popularity, he toured in Southeast Asia. In 2008, Lobo released ''Out of Time'' with old favorites and some new songs. A tribute album to the original era of the early Lobo recordings was made available from the website.

'''Loggins and Messina''' was an American [[pop rock]] duo consisting of [[Kenny Loggins]] and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], who achieved major chart success during the early-mid 1970s. Among their well-known songs are "[[Danny's Song]]", "[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]", and "[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]". After selling more than 16 million records and becoming one of the leading musical duos of the 1970s,<ref name="Thibodeaux">"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi," by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> Loggins and Messina separated in 1976. Although Messina would find only limited popularity following the breakup, Loggins went on to achieve major chart success in the 1980s. In 2005 and again in 2009, Loggins and Messina reformed for tours in the United States.

==History==
===Initial career 1971–1976===
[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Poco (band)|Poco]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he met [[Kenny Loggins]], a little-known singer/songwriter and guitarist who was signed to [[ABC-Dunhill]] as a staff songwriter.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=766}}</ref>

The two recorded a number of Loggins' compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins to a six-album contract (with the assistance of Messina), recording began in earnest for Loggins' debut album, with Messina as producer. Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. However, by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album – in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation, and vocals – that an "accidental" duo was born.

Their debut album was released November 1971 as ''Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina [[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored "[[Vahevala]]" (or "Vahevella" or "Vaheevella"), found top 3 success on Chicago's [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on May 18, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL - all hit music in the Midwest|publisher=Oldiesloon.com|date=May 18, 1972|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref> "Vahevala" and "Nobody But You" both reached the [[Hot 100]]. Although at first the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually gained traction by autumn 1972, particularly on college campuses, where the pair toured heavily. Loggins' and Messina's harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity unto itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of just continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo: Loggins and Messina.<ref name="Larkin"/>

On March 3, 1973, Loggins and Messina played Carnegie Hall. Ian Dove in the ''New York Times'' called it a "near-perfect rock 'n' roll concert".<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 3, 1973|title=LOGGINS AND MESSINA PLAY CARNEGIE ROCK (Published 1973)|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/03/archives/loggins-and-messina-play-carnegie-rock.html|access-date=March 13, 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

"When our first album, ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]'', came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales," Messina recalled in 2005. "We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that, and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, 'You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest.' He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one."<ref name="Thibodeaux" />

Messina assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning old friends, bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante, formerly of [[The Sunshine Company]], multireedist [[Jon Clarke (musician)|Jon Clarke]], and violinist/multireedist Al Garth. Famed [[Grammy]]-winning keyboardist, songwriter and record producer [[Michael Omartian]] played keyboards on the [[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|debut]], [[Loggins and Messina (album)|second]] and [[Full Sail (Loggins and Messina album)|third]] albums, but did not join them on tour. Los Angeles–based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]] played on all of the duo's studio albums, but like Omartian, he did not tour with them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's 'Vahevala' |publisher=Mixonline |date=September 1, 2004 |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

Over the next four years, from 1972 to 1976, they produced four more studio albums of original material, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material (''[[So Fine (Loggins and Messina album)|So Fine]]''), and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Hall & Oates]].<ref name="Thibodeaux" /> They charted three top 20 singles from the second and third albums: "[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]" (No. 4), "[[Thinking of You (Loggins and Messina song)|Thinking of You]]" (No. 18), and "[[My Music (song)|My Music]]" (No. 16). Their work was covered by other prominent artists, including [[Lynn Anderson]], who recorded "[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]" in 1972 and reached No. 3 on the charts, and [[Anne Murray]], who reached the U.S. top ten with "[[Danny's Song]]" in early 1973 and the U.S. top twenty with "[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]" in early 1974. The later studio albums, ''[[Mother Lode (album)|Mother Lode]]'' (1974), ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'' (1976), often found both Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record rather than as a genuine partnership. As both Loggins and Messina noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition.

Never really a team of true equals because of the initial teacher–apprentice nature of their music experience levels, the pair had quietly, amicably parted in 1976. Their final studio album of original material, ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'', was released January 1976. Later that year the duo went on a final tour, <ref name="Larkin"/> though prior to the start of the tour, Loggins accidentally cut his hand with a [[craft knife]] while practicing his wood-carving hobby at home which required surgery, thereby preventing him from playing guitar for most of that final tour. The final two concert dates of Loggins & Messina - as a duo - were in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, at the [[Neil S. Blaisdell Center]], on September 24 and 25, 1976, upon which the duo then parted to embark on solo careers. Messina found solo success elusive, but Loggins went on to become one of the biggest hitmakers of the 1980s.

A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released in November 1976, two months after the duo had ended.  In January 1977, a second live album (from concerts in 1975 and 1976), ''[[Finale (album)|Finale]]'', was released, more by record company decision than one intended by the artists.

===Reformation===
The two reunited in 2005 to choose tracks for an expanded compilation album of singles and album cuts ''[[The Best: Sittin' In Again]]'', which proved successful enough for them to embark on tour together. Their successful "Sittin' In Again" tour was launched in mid-2005 and played-out the remainder of the year. They also released an album that year of the tour. "Every couple of years we'd talk about it, but I was having too much fun as a solo artist," Loggins said that summer. "It was very rewarding for me, and I wasn't ready to share the reins. I still had a lot of stuff to do on my own, to prove myself and to express myself, in a way that wouldn't have fit in with Loggins and Messina."<ref name="Thibodeaux" />

The two were pleased enough to consider future Loggins and Messina projects and the two also toured in 2009. "Like most relationships, we were a moment in time," Loggins said. "It's just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men, in a way we never really did back then. We were young and competitive and didn't realize that it wasn't necessarily all about getting your way, but you learn that if you grow up."<ref name="Thibodeaux" />

Their backing band changed from album to album, with the core members listed below. Some albums featured backing members who later were well-known in their own right; [[John Townsend (artist)|John Townsend]] and [[Ed Sanford]], later of the [[Sanford-Townsend Band]] ("[[Smoke from a Distant Fire]]"), contributed vocals and songwriting to the ''Native Sons'', their final studio album.

==Early life and career==
Etheridge was born in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], the younger of two daughters of Elizabeth (Williamson), a computer consultant, and John Etheridge, an [[American Constitution]] teacher at her alma mater, [[Leavenworth High School]]. John Etheridge died in August 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/melissa-etheridge-takes-the-long-hard-road-from-the-heartland-to-hollywood-64105/ |title=Melissa Etheridge Takes the Long Hard Road from the Heartland to Hollywood|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>

Etheridge began guitar lessons aged eight.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 18, 2021|title='I considered having kids with Brad Pitt': Melissa Etheridge on music, motherhood and coming out|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/18/melissa-etheridge-music-motherhood-coming-out-brad-pitt|access-date=November 22, 2021|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> She started to play in local country music groups in her teenage years and graduated from high school in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/analysis/pieces-of-her-heart-183941.html|title=Pieces of her heart|date=February 16, 2012|website=Irishexaminer.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leavenworthtimes.com/article/20101012/NEWS/310129861|title=Leavenworth's own Melissa Etheridge lets us .... inside her window|first=Dale|last=Brendel|website=The Leavenworth Times - Leavenworth, KS}}</ref> While attending college at [[Berklee College of Music]], Etheridge played the club circuit around [[Boston]]. After three semesters, Etheridge decided to drop out of Berklee and move to Los Angeles to attempt a career in music.<ref name="All Music" />

==Career==
===1982–1992: Road to rock stardom===
Etheridge was discovered at Vermie's, a bar in Pasadena, California. She had made some friends on a women's soccer team, and those new friends came to see her play. One of the women was Karla Leopold, whose husband, Bill Leopold, was a manager in the music business. Karla convinced Bill to see Etheridge perform live. He was impressed, and became a pivotal part of Etheridge's career.<ref name=autobiography>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_4DEtjV0vcC&q=carla+leopold+%2B+etheridge&pg=PA72|title=The Truth Is ...: My Life in Love and Music|last1=Etheridge|first1=Melissa|last2=Morton |first2=Laura|year=2002|edition=2nd|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=72|isbn=978-0-307-76564-2}}</ref>  This, in addition to her gigs in lesbian bars around Los Angeles, led to her discovery by [[Island Records]] chief Chris Blackwell. She signed a publishing deal to write songs for films including the 1986 movie ''[[Weeds (1987 film)|Weeds]]''.<ref name="Country Music Television">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/melissa-etheridge|title=Melissa Etheridge|author=cmt.com|publisher=MTV Networks|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-date=September 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908021303/http://www.cmt.com/artists/melissa-etheridge|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After an unreleased first effort that was rejected by Island Records as being too polished and glossy, she completed her stripped-down, self-titled debut in just four days. Her eponymous debut album ''[[Melissa Etheridge (album)|Melissa Etheridge]]'' (1988), was an underground hit, and the single "[[Bring Me Some Water]]" performed well on radio and was nominated for a Grammy Award.<ref name="Country Music Television" />

At the time of the album's release, it was not generally known that Etheridge was a lesbian. While on the road promoting the album, she paused in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to be interviewed for the syndicated radio program ''Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland'', explaining the intensity of her music by saying: "People think I'm really sad—or really angry. But my songs are written about the conflicts I have...I have no anger toward anyone else."<ref>Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Go, Girl, Go! The Women's Revolution in Music," Schirmer Trade Books, p. 115.</ref> She invited the radio syndication producer to attend her concert that night. He did and was surprised to find himself one of the few men in attendance.<ref>Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Go, Girl, Go! The Women's Revolution in Music," Schirmer Trade Books, p. 114.</ref>

Etheridge's second album, ''[[Brave and Crazy]]'', was released in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/brave-and-crazy-mw0000201739|title=Brave and Crazy - Melissa Etheridge &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> ''Brave and Crazy'' followed the same musical formula as her eponymous debut; it also garnered a Grammy nomination. The album peaked at No. 22 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] (equal to her first album). Etheridge then went on the road, like one of her musical influences, [[Bruce Springsteen]], and built a loyal fan base.<ref name="Biography.com" />

In 1992, Etheridge released her third album, ''[[Never Enough (Melissa Etheridge album)|Never Enough]]''. Similar to her prior two albums, ''Never Enough'' didn't reach the top of the charts peaking at #21 but gave Etheridge her first Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] for her single "Ain't It Heavy". ''Never Enough'' was considered a more personal and mature album from Etheridge at that time. With rumors circulating around her sexuality (Etheridge was not out yet at this point), the album seemed to inadvertently address these rumors.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6883|pure_url=yes}}|title=Never Enough – Melissa Etheridge|website=AllMusic|date=March 17, 1992|access-date=May 18, 2012}}</ref>

In 1992, Etheridge established a performing arts scholarship at Leavenworth High School in honor of her recently deceased father. According to Etheridge, her father purchased her first guitar and "would come with me to bars in the area when I played because I was underage".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/1992/5/20/18984888/scholarship-venerates-memory-of-singer-s-dad|title=SCHOLARSHIP VENERATES MEMORY OF SINGER'S DAD|date=May 20, 1992|website=Deseret News}}</ref>

===1993–1995: ''Yes I Am''===
In January 1993, Etheridge came out publicly as a lesbian. On September 21, 1993, she released ''[[Yes I Am (Melissa Etheridge album)|Yes I Am]]'', which became her mainstream breakthrough album.<ref name="Jeremy Bonfiglio">{{cite web|url=https://www.heraldpalladium.com/features/melissa-etheridge-taps-into-her-memphis-soul/article_c752b815-c556-5f33-b6e2-e87a9e9a763b.html|title= Melissa Etheridge taps into her Memphis soul|publisher=HeraldPalladium.com|author=Jeremy Bonfiglio|date=June 15, 2017|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref> Co-produced with [[Hugh Padgham]], ''Yes I Am'' spent 138 weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts and peaked at No. 15. It scored two mainstream hits: "[[Come to My Window]]" and her only ''Billboard'' Top 10 single,  "[[I'm the Only One]]", which also hit #1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Adult Contemporary chart. ''Yes I Am'' earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certification of 6× platinum.<ref name="riaa"/>

Etheridge earned her second Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] for her single "Come to My Window". She also garnered two additional nominations in the Best Rock Song category for "I'm the Only One" and "Come to My Window", losing to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=THE 37TH GRAMMY NOMINATIONS |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-06-ca-17089-story.html |access-date=January 12, 2022 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 6, 1995}}</ref>

In 1993, Etheridge boycotted playing shows in Colorado over its passage of [[Romer v. Evans|Amendment 2]].<ref name="Biography.com">{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504284821.html?dids=504284821:504284821&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+10,+1993&author=&pub=The+Record&desc=Station+spurns+Etheridge&pqatl=google9 |title= Station spurs Etheridge |access-date= May 23, 2010 |date= September 10, 1993 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121102194558/https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504284821.html?dids=504284821:504284821&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+10,+1993&author=&pub=The+Record&desc=Station+spurns+Etheridge&pqatl=google9 |archive-date= November 2, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

Also in 1994, she was honored by VH-1 for her work with the AIDS organization L.A. Shanti. During the televised occasion, she highlighted the appearance with a performance of "I'm the Only One" and a duet with [[Sammy Hagar]] covering [[The Rolling Stones]]' song, "[[Honky Tonk Women]]."<ref name="pg 166">{{cite book|title=Melissa Etheridge: Our Little Secret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kN03ue54jmIC&pg=PA166|author=Joyce Luck|year = 1997|page=166| publisher=ECW Press |isbn = 9781550222982}}</ref>

[[File:Melissa Etheridge concert ticket - 1995 - Stierch.jpg|thumbnail|Melissa Etheridge concert ticket, 1995]]
The success of ''Yes I Am'' helped increase sales of Etheridge's earlier albums. In 1995, ''Melissa Etheridge'' earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certification of 2× platinum, while ''Never Enough'' earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certification of platinum.<ref name="riaa"/>

Etheridge's follow-up to ''Yes I Am'' was the successful ''[[Your Little Secret]]'' (1995). The album was not as well received by critics as Etheridge's prior recordings. Featuring a lead single of the same name, ''[[Your Little Secret]]'' is the highest-charting album of Etheridge's career, having reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' album charts; however, the album spent only 41 weeks on the chart. The album produced two Top 40 singles "[[I Want to Come Over]]" (''Billboard'' #22, ''RPM'' #1) and "Nowhere to Go" (''Billboard'' #40) and earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certification of 2× platinum.<ref name="riaa"/>

===1996–2003: After her breakthrough===
In 1996, Etheridge won an ASCAP Songwriter of the Year award. She also took a lengthy break from the music business to concentrate on her family when her first two children Bailey (1997) and Beckett (1998) were born.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parents.com/parenting/dynamics/gay-parents/melissa-etheridge-sperm-donation-lgbtq-parenting/|title=Melissa Etheridge Speaks Candidly About the Intricacies of LGBTQ Parenting|website=Parents.com|access-date=November 11, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Country Music Television" /> She also recorded "Sin Tener A Donde Ir (Nowhere to Go)" for the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin |url=https://redhot.org/project/red-hot-latin-silencio-muerte/ |website=redhot.org |access-date=January 12, 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

Etheridge returned to the music charts with the release of ''[[Breakdown (Melissa Etheridge album)|Breakdown]]''  in October 1999. ''Breakdown'' peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts and spent 18 weeks in the charts. Despite this, ''Breakdown''  was the only album of Etheridge's career to be nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]] (losing to [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]''). In addition, her single "Angels Would Fall" was nominated in two categories: [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] (losing to [[Sheryl Crow]]) and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] (losing to the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]) in 2000. A year later, another single from the album--"Enough of Me"—was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] (also losing to [[Sheryl Crow]]). The album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="riaa"/>

The year 2001 saw the release of ''[[Skin (Melissa Etheridge album)|Skin]]'', an album she described as "the closest I've ever come to recording a concept album. It has a beginning, middle and end.

'''Michael Jay Johnson''' (August 8, 1944 – July 25, 2017) was an American pop, [[country music|country]], and [[folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter and guitarist. He is best remembered for his 1978 hit song "[[Bluer Than Blue]]". He charted four hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and nine more on [[Hot Country Songs]], including two number one country hits in 1986's "[[Give Me Wings]]" and "[[The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder]]". He also co-wrote "Cain's Blood", the debut single of 1990s country group [[4 Runner]].

==Career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}
Johnson was born in the small town of [[Alamosa, Colorado]] and grew up in [[Denver]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mjblue.com/|title=Michael Johnson: Singer & Guitarist|website=Mjblue.com|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> He started playing the guitar at 13. In 1963, he began attending Colorado State College (now the [[University of Northern Colorado]]) in Greeley to study music but his college career was truncated when he won an international talent contest two years later. First prize included a deal with [[Epic Records]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/bluer-than-blue-singer-michael-johnson-dead-at-72-w492020|title='Bluer Than Blue' Singer Michael Johnson Dead at 72|first=Stephen L.|last=Betts|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 27, 2017|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

Wishing to hone his instrumental skills, in 1966 he set off for [[Barcelona, Spain]], to the [[Liceu Conservatory]], studying with the eminent classical guitarists, Graciano Tarragó and [[Renata Tarragó]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjblue.com/bcountry.html|author=Barry McCloud|title=''Definitive Country: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Country Music and Its Performers'' (Perige, 1995).}}</ref> Upon his return to the States, he joined [[Randy Sparks]] in a group called the New Society and did a tour of the Orient.

When the band dissolved in 1967, he signed on with the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]] for a year, spending some of that time co-writing with another member, [[John Denver]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chadmitchelltrio.com/|title=Chad Mitchell Trio - Official Website|website=Chadmitchelltrio.com|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> The group was renamed Denver, Boise & Johnson. When the trio came to an end, Johnson made a radical departure from everything he had done previously by taking on a major supporting role in the off-Broadway production of ''[[Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris]].''<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/obituary/7881194/bluer-than-blue-michael-johnson-obit |title='Bluer Than Blue' Singer Michael Johnson Dies at 72 |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=July 27, 2017 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

In 1971, Johnson signed with [[Atco Records]] to record his first album, ''There Is A Breeze'', which was released in 1973 and produced by Johnson, Chris Dedrick, [[Peter Yarrow]] and [[Phil Ramone]] in New York and Toronto, Canada.<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=206/8}}</ref> Feeling this first effort was not a true reflection of his music (despite being a best seller in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area), Johnson self-produced his next LP in 1975, ''For All You Mad Musicians'', relying more on his voice and guitar for a folk feel. He followed this up with ''Ain't Dis Da Life'', where he added a rhythm section. With each new recording and his continued touring, his popularity was increasing.

Teaming up with [[Brent Maher]] and Steve Gibson in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Johnson created a two-song demo consisting of "[[Bluer Than Blue]]" and "[[Almost Like Being in Love]]" (the latter song from the Broadway musical ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]''). [[EMI America]] took one listen and wasted no time in signing him, quickly getting ''The Michael Johnson Album'' out in 1978. "Bluer Than Blue" was written by Randy Goodrum. The first single, "Bluer Than Blue", became Johnson's first [[Top 40]] hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the summer of 1978;<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> the song became a chart-topping single on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary]] chart. "Almost Like Being in Love" went to No.&nbsp;91 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart while hitting the Top 5 on the AC chart and the Top 40 on the pop chart. 

Johnson recorded five albums in all for EMI and in 1985 moved over to [[RCA Records]],<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> where he adopted a contemporary country style that stayed compatible with his soft, mellow leanings. He scored five Top Ten country hits from 1986 to 1989, including the chart-toppers "Give Me Wings" and "The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder."<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After two country albums on RCA (plus two greatest hits collections), Johnson moved over to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1991.

In 1995, the country music group [[4 Runner]] scored a minor hit with the single "[[Cain's Blood]]", for which Johnson co-wrote an updated version with Jack Sundrud of [[Poco (band)|Poco]].

==Death==
Johnson died at his home in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]] on July 25, 2017, two weeks before what would have been his 73rd birthday.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/bluer-than-blue-singer-michael-johnson-dies-at-72/436868903|title='Bluer Than Blue' Singer Michael Johnson dies at 72|first=Jon|last=Bream|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>

'''Nashville West''' was a short-lived [[United States|American]] [[country rock]] quartet, that was briefly together in the late 1960s.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=889}}</ref> The group comprised multi-instrumentalist [[Gene Parsons]], guitarist [[Clarence White]], singer-guitarist-fiddler [[Gib Guilbeau]] and bassist [[Wayne Moore (musician)|Wayne Moore]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Parsons and White left the band to join [[The Byrds]] while Guilbeau and Parsons later joined [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]].

Along with the [[International Submarine Band]], [[The Byrds]] and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], Nashville West was among the pioneering groups of the [[country rock]] genre.

An album by Nashville West was released in 1978, about ten years after the band had broken up. The material on the ''Nashville West'' album was recorded during a club date in 1968.
The album was released again 2003 on Rev-ola, a division of Cherry Red Records.

==History==
===Formation===
In the mid-1960s, [[Gene Parsons]] and fiddler [[Gib Guilbeau]], who had been earlier acquainted from their time together in a band called the Castaways, were hired for a recording session with the Gosdin Brothers' singing duo of [[Vern Gosdin|Vern]] and Rex Gosdin. The session, being produced by [[The Byrds]]' [[Chris Hillman]], included guitarist [[Clarence White]], who had formerly played [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] guitar in the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]]. Parsons, Guilbeau and White then went on to play on sessions together for several other [[country music]] artists and became the house band for [[Gary S. Paxton]]'s record label, [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] International Productions.<ref name="Byrdwatcher">{{Cite web|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/spnw1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425021745/http://ebni.com/byrds/spnw1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 25, 2009|title=Nashville West|date=April 25, 2009}}</ref>

In the course of their session work, Parsons and White devised the [[B-Bender]], or Stringbender, a system installed on White's [[Fender Telecaster]] that made the instrument sound like a [[pedal steel guitar]].<ref name = "Byrdwatcher"/>

Eventually, Parsons, Guilbeau and White became a band, joining with fellow session player, bassist-vocalist Wayne Moore, who played in the Castaways with Parsons and Guilbeau.<ref name="Larkin"/>

The group was known by various names, including The Reasons, Gib Guilbeau and The Reasons, the Gary Paxton Band or Cajun Gib and Gene.<ref name = "Gib">{{Cite web |url=http://members.chello.at/thomas.aubrunner/gib3.htm |title=Gib Guilbeau with Nashville West |access-date=2007-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118122158/http://members.chello.at/thomas.aubrunner/gib3.htm |archive-date=2007-11-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Nashville West moniker was taken from the name of the [[El Monte, California]] club where they sat as the house band,<ref name = "Byrdwatcher"/> and was the name of an instrumental song composed by Parsons and White.

===Break up===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Parsons and White were then asked to join [[The Byrds]] in 1969.<ref name="Larkin"/> White had already played on 1968's ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'' and ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]''. After both [[Gram Parsons]] (no relation to Gene) and Chris Hillman left the Byrds to form [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], White and Gene Parsons joined [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[John York (musician)|John York]] to become full-fledged members of The Byrds. The resulting next album, ''[[Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde]]'', featured White's and Parsons' signature instrumental tune, "Nashville West".<ref name="Larkin"/> White and Parsons were with the Byrds for the albums ''[[Live at the Fillmore - February 1969]]'', ''[[Ballad of Easy Rider (album)|Ballad of Easy Rider]]'', ''[[Untitled (The Byrds album)|(Untitled)]]'',  ''[[Byrdmaniax]]'' and ''[[Farther Along (The Byrds album)|Farther Along]]''.

When the original line-up of The Byrds reunited in March 1973 to record ''[[Byrds]]'', White left the Byrds to join the bluegrass [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Muleskinner (band)|Muleskinner]]. He also played on a package tour with several other country rock pioneers at the time, including Gram Parsons. White then reformed his old band, the Kentucky Colonels, with his brothers, but was killed on July 15, 1973 in [[Palmdale, California]], when he was struck by a car driven by a [[Driving under the influence|drunken driver]]. <ref>"Car kills Topanga musician", ''Long Beach (CA) Press-Telegram'', Monday, July 16, 1973, p. 13 (A Topanga musician loading instruments aboard his van was struck and killed Sunday...")</ref>

Guilbeau went on to play sessions with [[Linda Ronstadt]] and joined a band called Swampwater. He also played with [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]] in a group called Cold Steel. In 1974, Guilbeau and Gene Parsons joined [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]].

As a session band, Nashville West recorded prolifically, though never under the Nashville West name, backing other artists on [[Gary S. Paxton]]'s record label.<ref name = "Gib"/> However, in 1978, an album under the name ''Nashville West'' was eventually released on the [[Sierra Records]] label. The material on it came from a 1967 club date in [[El Monte, California]], which had been recorded by Parsons for personal use, and not necessarily for album release.

The songs include an instrumental reading of [[Bobbie Gentry]]'s "[[Ode to Billie Joe]]".

"I had a Sony two-track, and I hooked it up, partly to the sound system and partly to the microphones, and just let it run and recorded the whole night," Parsons said. "There's a lot that never got on the album, thank goodness."<ref name = "Byrdwatcher"/>

The album was reissued on CD by Sierra in 1997, and added four more tracks not included on the LP edition: "C.C. Rider", "Greensleeves", "Mom and Dad's Waltz" and "Columbus Stockade Blues".

==Early life==
Born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], Case is the only child of James Bamford Case<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ferndalerecord.com/m-lucille-case/|title=M. Lucille Case &#124; Ferndale Record|website=Ferndalerecord.com}}</ref> and Diana Mary Dubbs.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} Case's paternal family surname was originally [[Shevchenko]]; her great-aunt was the professional wrestler [[Ella Waldek]].<ref name=EW-Amazing>{{cite magazine|last=Berick|first=Michael|title=Department of Amazing Coincidences: Neko's Gripping Tale|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 7, 2005|issue=806|url=https://ew.com/article/2005/02/07/neko-cases-amazing-coincidence/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426002142/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1024590,00.html |access-date=November 7, 2013|url-status=live|archive-date=April 26, 2009 }}</ref> Her father, a [[Vietnam]] veteran serving in the [[United States Air Force]],<ref name=Furious-Thrice>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever|access-date=November 7, 2013|format=Online music magazine}}</ref> was based in Virginia at the time of her birth. Case's parents, who were teenagers when they had her, are of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ancestry.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> Her parents divorced when Case began school.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline />

Case's family relocated several times during her childhood due to her stepfather's work as an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. She has lived in Western Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon and Washington.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline /> She considers [[Tacoma, Washington]] to be her hometown.

Case left home at age 15. By the age of 18 she was performing as a drummer for the Del Logs and the Propanes, playing in venues including a punk club called the Community World Theater.<ref name=ExclaimTimeline />

==Music career==
===Vancouver===
In 1994, Case moved to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, to attend the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]]. While attending, she played drums in several local bands, including the Del Logs, the Propanes, the Weasels, [[Cub (band)|Cub]], and [[Maow]]. These bands  were, for the most part, local [[Punk rock|punk]] groups. Case said of the vibrant Vancouver punk rock scene at that time, "A lot of women wanted to play music because they were inspired, because it was an incredibly good time for music in the Northwest. There was a lot of clubs, a lot of bands, a lot of people coming through, a lot of all-ages stuff—it was a very exciting time to live there."<ref name=Furious-Thrice />

In 1998, Case left without finishing her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, which meant the loss of her student [[visa (document)|visa]] eligibility.<ref>Francois Marchand, [https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/music/the-miseducation-of-neko-case "The miseducation of Neko Case"], ''The Vancouver Sun'', April 8, 2015. Retrieved July 27, 2018.</ref> She left Canada for [[Seattle]], Washington. Before going, Case recorded vocals for a few songs that ended up on ''[[Mass Romantic]]'', [[the New Pornographers]]' first album. Her lead vocals on songs like "Letter from an Occupant" are straightforward, full-volume [[power-pop]] performances,  shedding any country elements. Released on November 28, 2000, ''Mass Romantic'' became a surprise success.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=February 05 |last2=Arts |first2=2011 {{!}} Brian C. {{!}} |last3=culture |last4=Feminism |last5=Media |title=Support Women Artists Sunday: Neko Case - Women's Media Center |url=https://womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/support-women-artists-sunday-neko-case |access-date=2023-10-09 |website=Womensmediacenter.com |language=en}}</ref> Although the band was originally conceived as a side project for its members, the New Pornographers remain a prominent presence in the indie rock world, having released its ninth album in 2023.

In addition to recording with the New Pornographers, Case frequently collaborates with other Canadian musicians, including [[the Sadies]] and [[Carolyn Mark]], and has recorded material by several noted Canadian songwriters, in particular on her 2001 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Canadian Amp]]''. As a result, she is also considered a significant figure in Canadian music—both [[CBC Radio 3]] and the [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]] have referred to Case as an "honourary Canadian".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/news_events/feature_stories/Neko.jsp |title=Neko Case: Honourary Canadian, Proud SOCAN Member |author=Jim Kelly |date=2003-01-19 |access-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030119234628/http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/news_events/feature_stories/Neko.jsp |archive-date=January 19, 2003 }}</ref> In 2018 Case performed at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.<ref>[https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ "41st Vancouver Folk Music Festival still true to tradition, still young at heart"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713225922/https://vancouverweekly.com/41st-vancouver-folk-music-festival-still-true-to-tradition-still-young-at-heart-61154-2/ |date=July 13, 2019 }}.

Case embraced country music on her 1997 album, ''[[The Virginian (album)|The Virginian]]''. The album contained original compositions as well as covers of songs by [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Loretta Lynn]] and the 1974 [[Queen (band)|Queen]] song "[[Misfire (song)|Misfire]]".<ref name="Peppiatt2004">{{cite book|author=Francesca Peppiatt|title=Country Music's Most WantedTM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huXRARoi8vcC&pg=PT190|date=19 February 2004|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61234-241-2|pages=190–}}</ref> When the album was released, critics compared Case to [[honky tonk|honky-tonk]] singers like Lynn and [[Patsy Cline]], and to [[rockabilly]] pioneer [[Wanda Jackson]], particularly in her vocal timbre.<ref>{{cite news|first=Grant|last=Britt|url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-and-record-grant-britt-neko-case/130981137/|title=Neko Case performance is a chance to live in the moment|newspaper=News and Record (Greensboro, North Carolina)|date= January 18, 2018|page=13-Go Triad|access-date=August 31, 2023|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

On February 22, 2000, Case released her second solo album, ''[[Furnace Room Lullaby]]''. The album introduced the "country noir" elements that have defined Case's subsequent solo career. That tone was evident even from the cover photo, featuring Case sprawled out corpse-like on a concrete floor. On the album itself, her vocal style moves away from outright honky-tonk but retains her twang, garnering comparisons to musicians such as Cline, Lynn, [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Tanya Tucker]], and [[Dolly Parton]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The title track was included on the soundtrack to [[Sam Raimi]]'s film ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and "Porchlight" was featured on the soundtrack to ''[[The Slaughter Rule]]''.

Case sometimes tours with Canadian singer and songwriter Carolyn Mark as [[the Corn Sisters]].<ref name=holliston>Tom Holliston, [http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/The-Corn-Sisters "The Corn Sisters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=March 1, 2016 }}.

===Chicago===
In October 1999, around the time ''Furnace Room Lullaby'' was released, Case left Seattle<ref name=Furious-Thrice /> for Chicago because she felt that Seattle was no longer hospitable to its local artists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scanlon |first=Tom |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000615&slug=4026820 |title=Living &#124; Country singer Neko Case is movin' on &#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2000-06-15 |access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref>

Case's first work in Chicago was an eight-song [[Extended play|EP]] that she recorded in her kitchen. ''[[Canadian Amp]]'', her first recording without Her Boyfriends, was released on her own Lady Pilot label in 2001. She wrote two of the tracks, with the remaining six being covers, including [[Neil Young]]'s "Dreaming Man" and Hank Williams' "Alone and Forsaken". Four of the covers were written by Canadian artists. The EP was initially available only at Case's live shows and directly from Mint Records' website, but it eventually saw wider release.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78018/canadian-amp|title=Canadian Amp|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref>

Case also recorded her third full-length album, ''[[Blacklisted (Neko Case album)|Blacklisted]]'', while living in Chicago.

In April 2003, Case was voted the "Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock" in a Playboy.com internet poll, receiving 32% of the vote. ''[[Playboy]]'' asked her to pose nude for the magazine, but she declined their offer. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that

<blockquote>I didn't want to be the girl who posed in ''Playboy'' and then—by the way—made some music. I would be really fucking irritated if after a show somebody came up to me and handed me some naked picture of myself and wanted me to sign it instead of my CD.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Valby |first=Karen |url=https://ew.com/article/2003/06/06/lovably-foulmouthed-neko-case-sounds/ |title=Gloves Off |magazine=EW.com |date=2003-06-06 |access-date=2014-08-11 |archive-date=May 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504113344/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,455377,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

In later interviews, she declined to discuss the survey at all.

===Neko Case & Her Boyfriends===
Case recorded and toured for several years as '''Neko Case & Her Boyfriends''' before performing solely under her name. She primarily performed her own material, but also performed and recorded [[cover version]]s of songs by artists such as [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] and [[Hank Williams]].  
Albums released included ''[[The Virginian (album)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[Furnace Room Lullaby]]''.

===New Pornographers===
[[The New Pornographers]]' second album, ''[[Electric Version]]'', was released on May 6, 2003. Case sang lead on even more of the songs on this album, and toured with the group again.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''[[Twin Cinema]]'', the New Pornographers' third album, was released on August 23, 2005, with Case again providing vocals on several tracks. In addition to providing backing vocals on several songs, Case performs lead vocals on two ballads, "The Bones of an Idol" and "These Are the Fables". She opted out of most subsequent touring duties with the band; however, her parts were taken over by [[Kathryn Calder]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On ''[[Challengers (album)|Challengers]]'', released on August 21, 2007, Case contributes lead vocals to the title song as well as "Go Places", in addition to her backing vocals on the other tracks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The 2010 album ''[[Together (New Pornographers album)|Together]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Crash Years" and "My Shepherd."<ref>{{cite web|title=Together Credits|url=http://allmusic.com/album/together-r1743496/credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

The 2014 album ''[[Brill Bruisers]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Champions of Red Wine" and "Marching Orders."

The 2017 album ''[[Whiteout Conditions]]'' features Case as lead vocalist on "Play Money" and "This is the World of the Theater."

====''Blacklisted''====
Case recorded her third full-length album, ''[[Blacklisted (Neko Case album)|Blacklisted]]'', in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. It was the first full-length album credited to Case alone, without Her Boyfriends, and was released on [[Bloodshot Records]] on August 20, 2002.

Most of the album's fourteen songs are originals; the exceptions being covers of "Running Out of Fools", previously a hit for [[Aretha Franklin]], and "Look for Me (I'll Be Around)" previously performed by [[Sarah Vaughan]]. ''Blacklisted'' finds Case even deeper in a "country noir" mood, and was described by critics as lush, bleak, and atmospheric. Case cited filmmaker [[David Lynch]], composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], and Neil Young's soundtrack to the film ''[[Dead Man]]'' as influences.<ref name=nekocaseinterview>{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|title=Neko Case: Thrice All American| url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/nekocase.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever | date= October 14, 2002 |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref>

'''Nickel Creek''' (formerly known as '''the Nickel Creek Band''') is an American [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band consisting of [[Chris Thile]] ([[mandolin]]), and siblings [[Sara Watkins]] ([[fiddle]]) and [[Sean Watkins]] ([[guitar]]). Formed in 1989 in Southern California, they released six albums between 1993 and 2006. The band broke out in 2000 with a platinum-selling self-titled album produced by [[Alison Krauss]], earning a number of [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[CMA Awards|CMA]] nominations.

Their fourth album “This Side” won a 2003 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Following a fifth studio album and a compilation album, the band announced an indefinite hiatus at the conclusion of their 2007 ''Farewell (For Now) Tour''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57406/nickel-creek-going-on-hiatus-just-not-yet |title=Nickel Creek Going On Hiatus, Just Not Yet |magazine=Billboard |access-date=2014-04-01}}</ref> Following numerous solo projects from the band members, Nickel Creek reformed in 2014 with announcement of [[A Dotted Line|a new album]] and subsequent tour.<ref name="blogs.tennessean.com"/>

==History==
The Watkins and Thile families met after Sean Watkins and Chris Thile had [[mandolin]] lessons with the same music instructor, John Moore. Sara Watkins studied with Moore's bandmate, Dennis Caplinger. The band name comes from a song by [[Byron Berline]], who was Sara Watkins' fiddle instructor.<ref name="thilebio">Seida, Linda.

Nickel Creek met [[Alison Krauss]] at one of their shows and later invited her to produce their next album.  According to band member Sara Watkins, the group was "thrilled" with the guidance they received from Krauss to upgrade their vocal sound and the overall "production of the CD."<ref>[http://www.ibluegrass.com/vi_posting3.CFM?

In 2002, the band released their fourth album, ''This Side'', produced by Alison Krauss. It was a departure from their previous, purely bluegrass releases.

'''Nicolette Larson''' (July 17, 1952 – December 16, 1997) was an American singer. She is perhaps best known for her work in the late 1970s with [[Neil Young]] and her 1978 hit single of Young's "[[Lotta Love]]", which hit No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart<ref name=adult/> and No.&nbsp;8 on the pop singles chart.<ref name=us/> It was followed by four more [[adult contemporary]] hits, two of which were also minor pop hits.

By 1985, she shifted her focus to [[country music]], charting six times on the US country singles chart.<ref name=country/> Her only top-40 country hit was "That's How You Know When Love's Right", a duet with [[Steve Wariner]]. She died in 1997 of [[cerebral edema]] and [[liver failure]].

== Early life and career ==
Nicolette Larson was born in [[Helena, Montana]].<ref name=larson2>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Nicolette Larson |last=Perrone|first=Pierre|newspaper=Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-nicolette-larson-1290653.html|date=December 27, 1997|access-date=September 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=larsonallm>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p18807|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography: Nicolette Larson |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Her father's employment with the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] necessitated frequent relocation for the family. She graduated from high school in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where she attended the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City|University of Missouri]] for three semesters and worked at waitressing and office jobs before beginning to pursue the musical career she had dreamed of since singing along to the radio as a child.

In the early 1970s, Larson eventually settled in [[San Francisco, California]], where she worked in a record store (Discount Records, on [[Telegraph Avenue]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], which also sold tickets for shows at the [[Fillmore West]] and [[Winterland]]) and for the Golden Gate Country Bluegrass Festival. Turning to singing, her performance career began with  a booking as the opening act for [[Eric Andersen]] at The Egress, a club in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]]. In 1975, Larson auditioned for [[Hoyt Axton]], who was producing [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]]. This led to Larson singing with Hoyt Axton and The Banana Band, who were opening for [[Joan Baez]] on the "Diamonds and Rust" tour in 1975. She earned her first recording credit on Commander Cody's 1975 album ''Tales From the Ozone'', toured with his band and also provided background vocals on subsequent Commander Cody albums in 1977 and 1978. Other early career singing credits were for Axton and [[Guy Clark]], both in 1976; the following year her resume included further credits with [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Jesse Winchester]], and [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]].

Larson and Guthrie Thomas both had their first professional recording session on Axton's ''Southbound'' album for A&M Records. As newcomers to the recording industry, they were listed on the back cover of the album as "Street Singers", entirely separate from the highly paid, more established artists also appearing on the album.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Nicolette Larson (vocal credits) |url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/249839-Nicolette-Larson?filter_anv=0&type=Credits |website = Discogs |access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref>

Larson's work with [[Emmylou Harris]] – whose 1977 album ''[[Luxury Liner (album)|Luxury Liner]]'' prominently showcased Larson on the song "Hello Stranger" – led to her meeting and then befriending Harris's associate and friend [[Linda Ronstadt]]. In 1977, Larson was at Ronstadt's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home when neighbor [[Neil Young]] phoned to ask Ronstadt if she could recommend a female vocal accompanist. Ronstadt suggested Larson; she was the third person that day to mention Larson to Young. He came over to meet Larson, who recalled, "Neil ran down all the songs he had just written, about twenty of them. We sang harmonies with him and he was jazzed."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs280-nicolette-larson |title=Nicolette Larson's Time Has Come |first=Cameron |last=Crowe |author-link=Cameron Crowe |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |number=280 |date=November 14, 1978 |issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

The following week Ronstadt and Larson cut their vocals for Young's ''[[American Stars 'n Bars]]'' album at Young's [[La Honda, California|La Honda]] ranch – the two women were billed on the album as the Bullets – and, in November 1977, Young invited Larson to [[Nashville]] to sing on his ''[[Comes a Time]]'' album. This led to Larson's being signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]].

Larson continued her background singing career into 1978, accruing credit on recordings by [[Marcia Ball]], [[Rodney Crowell]], Emmylou Harris (''[[Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town]]''), and [[Norton Buffalo]]. She also sang on [[the Doobie Brothers]]' ''[[Minute by Minute]]''. That album's producer, [[Ted Templeman]], then produced Larson's debut album, ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]''.<ref name=larson>{{cite magazine |title=Music World Says Goodbye To Nicolette Larson |last=Cramer |first=Christina |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/music-world-says-goodbye-to-nicolette-larson-19971218 |date=December 18, 1997 |access-date=August 9, 2011}}</ref>

== 1978–1983 ==
Larson's work with Commander Cody had led to her being signed to the [[country music|C&W]] division of [[Warner Bros. Records]]. However her debut album ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]'', released September 29, 1978, was an eclectic mix of rock, C&W and R&B.

Despite the release of her album so late in the year, Larson was acclaimed Female Vocalist of 1978 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which wrote no one else could sound as if she were having so much fun on an album. ''Nicolette'' reached No.&nbsp;15 on Billboard's album chart aided by the hit single "[[Lotta Love]]", a [[Neil Young]] composition. Larson's "Lotta Love" hit #1 on the Easy Listening/Adult Contemporary chart and went Top 10 Pop in February 1979. Linda Ronstadt, Valerie Carter, Bill Payne, James Burton, and [[Patrick Simmons]] performanced on ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]'' album.<ref>[https://www.wincityvoices.org/art/music/jeffs-playlist-nicolette/ Nicolette] wincityvoices.org Retrieved 22 August 2024</ref> <!--the same week the single off(an Ian & Sylvia record with Larson uncredited on the single), debuted on the Hot 100 on its way to a No.&nbsp;61 peak. ("Sail Away", a track featuring Larson, from the ''Comes a Time'' sessions or was included on the otherwise live Neil Young album released in 1979-->

Warner Brothers also issued the limited edition (5,000 copies) promo-only ''Live at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]]'' album comprising a December 20, 1978, concert given by Larson at the [[Sunset Boulevard]] nightclub. Larson was also featured on the ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'' album recorded in September 1979 at [[Madison Square Garden]], backed by [[the Doobie Brothers]] in her performance of "Lotta Love".

Larson would be unable to consolidate the commercial success augured by her debut: the second single off ''Nicolette'', "Rhumba Girl"<ref>"Rhumba Girl" was written by Jesse Winchester, who introduced it as "Rhumba Man" on his ''Nothing But a Breeze'' album. Although Larson had been a session singer on ''Nothing But a Breeze'' she had not sung on "Rhumba Man", first hearing the song at a live performance by Winchester.</ref> just missed becoming a major hit for Larson at No.&nbsp;48. Her second album, ''In the Nick of Time,'' released November 1979, failed to showcase Larson's voice attractively. Don Shewey in ''Rolling Stone'' wrote:<blockquote>Larson's rough-edged, down-home tone is definitely appealing – especially when she backs up the likes of Neil Young and [[Steve Goodman]] [whose ''High and Outside'' album featured a duet with Larson: "The One That Got Away"] – but as a soloist, her limited vocal resources are "severely taxed" – "It's symptomatic of Nicolette Larson's problems as a performer that the finest singing on ''In the Nick of Time'' is by [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]. 'Let Me Go, Love'&nbsp;... McDonald's entrancing vocal presence&nbsp;... so overshadows Larson's that she seems to be playing second fiddle rather than sharing the lead. Elsewhere, Larson is dwarfed by [[Ted Templeman]]'s typically luxurious production".<ref name="larson"/></blockquote>

Released as the album's lead single, "Let Me Go Love" reached only No.&nbsp;35 in February 1980. That year Larson was heard on the airwaves via guest appearances on "Say You'll Be Mine" by [[Christopher Cross]] and the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band|Dirt Band]]'s "Make a Little Magic". Larson had enough residual popularity from her debut for ''In the Nick of Time'' to become a moderate success. Because she had no major hit, Larson's 1981 and 1982 album releases, ''[[Radioland (album)|Radioland]]'' (her last album produced by Templeman) and ''[[All Dressed Up and No Place to Go]]'', were unsuccessful, even though both releases showed Larson back in strong vocal form. In 1982 Larson received some [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] radio airplay with her remake of "[[I Only Want to Be With You]]" (No. 53).<ref>[https://www.sessiondays.com/2022/04/1982-nicolette-larson-i-only-want-to-be-with-you-us53/ I Only Want to Be With You] sessiondays.com  Retrieved 22 August 2024</ref>

Larson had continued her background singing career accruing credits on releases by [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] (''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]''), [[Graham Nash]], [[John Stewart (folk musician)|John Stewart]], [[Albert Hammond]], and [[Rita Coolidge]]. Larson again backed [[the Doobie Brothers]] on their ''[[One Step Closer (The Doobie Brothers album)|One Step Closer]]'' album; she can be heard on the hit "Real Love." A song Larson co-wrote with [[John McFee]] and [[Patrick Simmons]] titled "Can't Let It Get Away" was a 1981 single release for the Doobie Brothers in [[Japan]]. <!--Larson contributed a harmony vocal on the track "Could This Be Magic" on the [[Van Halen]] album ''[[Women and Children First (album)|Women and Children First]]'' (1980), to thank [[Eddie Van Halen]] for playing guitar on the ''Nicolette'' album track "Can't Get Away From You," against [[David Lee Roth]]'s wishes.-->

Larson's recording of the [[Burt Bacharach]]/[[Carole Bayer Sager]] song "Fool Me Again" was featured on the bestselling soundtrack album for the 1981 film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]],'' despite not being heard in the film. Larson was also featured on the soundtrack album for ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' (1983) with the track "Summer Hearts".<ref>{{Citation|title=National Lampoon's Vacation - Original Soundtrack {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/national-lampoons-vacation-mw0000892869|language=en|access-date=2022-01-02}}</ref>

Larson's appearance in a touring production of the [[country music|C&W]] musical ''[[Pump Boys and Dinettes]]'' garnered enough positive reaction for [[MCA Records|MCA Nashville]] to sign her in 1983.

== 1984–1997 ==
The Nashville music community was so enthused about Larson's C&W cross-over that in 1984 the Academy of Country Music named her the Best New Female Vocalist before she had any MCA Nashville releases. Larson's MCA debut ''[[...Say When]]'' was not released until 1985 (by which point country pop was no longer in style and [[neotraditional country|neotraditionalists]] had taken over the country scene). The C&W career it ushered in for Larson proved anticlimactic with only one of her six MCA single releases becoming a significant hit: her duet with [[Steve Wariner]] titled "That's How You Know When Love's Right," taken from the April 1986 album release ''[[Rose of My Heart]].'' The record reached No.&nbsp;9 C&W. Larson's MCA albums, produced by [[Emory Gordy Jr.]] and [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], attracted little critical attention. Her final mainstream album release was ''[[Shadows of Love]]'', a 1988 recording made for the Italian [[Compagnia Generale del Disco|CGD]] label and produced by Carlo Stretti and Ernesto Taberelli. It was her only album for a non-US label. 

In 1992 Larson reunited professionally with [[Neil Young]] to sing on his ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' album. In 1993 she was featured on Young's ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|Unplugged]]''. <!--She also provided vocal accompaniment on "The Little Drummer Boy" and "Greensleeves", two of the tracks Young contributed to ''Seven Gates: A Christmas Album by [[Ben Keith]] and Friends'' (1994).-->Larson's final album was the self-produced ''Sleep, Baby, Sleep'', consisting of music for children, released by [[Sony Wonder]] in 1994.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/sleep-baby-sleep-mw0000247700 Sleep, Baby, Sleep] allmusic access-date=22 August 2024</ref>

Larson also contributed to the seasonal albums ''Tennessee Christmas '' (1987) with "One Bright Star", ''Acoustic Christmas'' (1988) with "Christmas Is a Time for Giving," and ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' (1989) with "Nothing But a Child" and "One Bright Star". In 1988, Larson contributed to the soundtracks of the film ''[[They Call Me Renegade]]'' with the tracks "Let Me Be the One" from her 1988 album ''[[Shadows of Love]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Renegade-Original-Soundtrack/release/4403954|title=Renegade - Original Soundtrack (1988, CD)|website=Discogs| access-date=21 August 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Nicolette-Larson-Shadows-Of-Love/release/3231533|title = Nicolette Larson – Shadows of Love (1988, Vinyl)| website=Discogs| access-date=21 August 2024}}</ref>

While it was recorded in 1978, ''Live at the Roxy'' was given its first full release in 2006, nine years after Larson's death. It was released by [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]].<ref>{{Discogs release|1320200 |Nicolette - Live At The Roxy}}</ref> Also in 2006, Rhino Entertainment released the album ''A Tribute to Nicolette Larson: Lotta Love Concert''. Two "Lotta Love" concerts were held on February 20 and 21, 1998, in Santa Monica, CA, to benefit the UCLA Children's Hospital. <ref>[https://archive.org/details/cd_a-tribute-to-nicolette-larson-lotta-love-c_various-artists-bonnie-raitt-carole-king-c]</ref>

== Personal life ==
Through her early work in the 1970s with [[Emmylou Harris]], Larson met guitarist and songwriter Hank DeVito. Larson and DeVito later married and divorced. She also dated Neil Young during the ''Comes a Time'' sessions. In the early 1980s, Larson was engaged to [[Andrew Gold]], but their relationship ended shortly after the completion of Larson's 1982 album ''All Dressed Up and No Place to Go,'' which Gold had produced. In the late 1980s, she briefly dated [["Weird Al" Yankovic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/ask-al/#0299|title=Ask Al {{!}} "Weird Al" Yankovic |last=Yankovic |first=Weird Al |website="Weird Al" Yankovic |access-date=September 7, 2016}}</ref> Yankovic would later compose "You Don't Love Me Anymore", a style parody of Larson's work, for his 1992 album ''[[Off the Deep End]]''. In 1990, Larson married drummer [[Russ Kunkel]], and the two remained married until her death in 1997. The couple's daughter, Elsie May Larson-Kunkel, was born in 1990.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Obituary: Nicolette Larson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-nicolette-larson-1290653.html |website=The Independent |access-date=January 14, 2016 |date=December 27, 1997 |first=Pierre |last=Perrone}}</ref>

== Death ==
Larson died on December 16, 1997, in Los Angeles, California, as a result of complications arising from [[cerebral edema]] triggered by liver failure.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-dec-18-mn-65515-story.html |title=Nicolette Larson; Award-Winning Singer |first=Myrna |last=Oliver |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 18, 1997}}</ref> She was 45 years old. According to her friend [[Astrid Young]], Neil Young's half-sister, Larson had been showing symptoms of depression, and her fatal seizure "was in no small way related to her chronic use of [[Valium]] and [[Tylenol PM]]."<ref>Young, Astrid. ''Being Young.'' p. 107, Insomniac Press, 2007; {{ISBN|978-1-897178-45-4}}</ref> Two benefit concerts were held in Larson's honor in February 1998. A tribute album was released in 2006 and Carole King and other famous musicians joined the album.<ref>[https://www.caroleking.com/news/carole-king-appears-nicolette-larson-tribute-album Carole King appears Nicolette・・・] caroleking.com Retrieved 21 August 2024</ref>

'''Nitty Gritty Dirt Band''' (sometimes abbreviated '''NGDB'''), known as '''the Dirt Band''' from 1978 to 1983, is an American band founded in [[Long Beach, California]], in 1966. Since 2018, the band has consisted of [[Jeff Hanna]] and his son Jaime Hanna, both guitarists and vocalists, along with Jimmie Fadden (drums, harmonica, vocals), Bob Carpenter (keyboards, accordion, vocals), [[Ross Holmes]] (fiddle, mandolin, vocals), and [[Jim Photoglo]] (bass guitar, vocals).

Jeff Hanna and Fadden founded the band in 1966 with a lineup initially consisting of Bruce Kunkel, Ralph Barr, Les Thompson, and [[Jackson Browne]], who quit early on and was replaced by longtime member [[John McEuen]] (vocals, guitar, banjo). The band had its first hit single in 1967 with "Buy for Me the Rain" on [[Liberty Records]]. Their earliest work featured [[jug band]] and traditional [[folk music|folk]] elements. In 1970, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had their biggest pop hit with a cover of [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]'s "[[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]". The band's sound took on elements of [[soft rock]] in the latter half of the 1970s and early 1980s, including the hit singles "[[An American Dream (song)|An American Dream]]" and "Make a Little Magic".

Starting in 1983, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band began a shift toward [[country music]], led off by the singles "Shot Full of Love" and "[[Dance Little Jean]]". By this point, the band consisted of Jeff Hanna, McEuen, Fadden, Carpenter, and [[Jimmy Ibbotson]] (bass guitar, vocals). This lineup recorded several country albums for [[Warner Records]] throughout the 1980s and charted multiple singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]]. Of these, "[[Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper's Dream)]]", "[[Modern Day Romance]]", and "[[Fishin' in the Dark]]" all went to number one, with the latter becoming their [[signature song]]. After leaving Warner in the late 1980s, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recorded for several other labels, including [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal]], [[MCA Nashville]], [[Rising Tide Records|Rising Tide]], and [[DreamWorks Records]]. The band has collaborated with a number of artists, including [[Doc Watson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[John Denver]], and [[Steve Martin]]. In addition, Hanna co-wrote [[Rascal Flatts]]'s 2005 single "[[Bless the Broken Road]]", which was originally recorded by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band has released three collaborative albums: ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken (album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' (1972), ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two]]'' in 1989, and ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III]]'' in 2002. All three albums featured a large number of guests from folk, rock, country, and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. They have also won three [[Grammy Awards]]. The band's sound draws influence from country, pop, rock, bluegrass, and folk music, and has seen generally positive critical reception.

==History==
[[File:Jackson Browne 2017.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Jackson Browne was a founding member of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.|alt=Musician Jackson Browne, playing an electric guitar and singing into a microphone.]]
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded in [[Long Beach, California]], in 1966. Founding guitarist [[Jeff Hanna]] was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, but his family had moved to Long Beach four years prior.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> While in high school, he befriended guitarist Bruce Kunkel, and the two played in a local duo called the New Coast Two.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-nitty-gritty-dirt-band-mn0000718907 | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band biography | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=July 8, 2024 | author=Mark Deming}}</ref> As they wanted to form a larger group, the two began playing impromptu jam sessions at a Long Beach music shop called McCabe's Guitar Shop. Through these performances, they recruited four other musicians. These were Jimmie Fadden, who at the time played [[washtub bass]], harmonica, and guitar, along with Ralph Barr (guitar, clarinet), Les Thompson (guitar, [[mandolin]]), and [[Jackson Browne]] (guitar). All six members also served as vocalists.

John's older brother [[William E. McEuen]] served as the band's manager, helping to book them as opening acts for artists such as [[Joan Baez]].

Liberty Records merged with [[United Artists Records]] in 1972. The band's first project for this label was 1972's ''[[All the Good Times]]''. The album had further cover songs on it, including [[Hank Williams]]'s "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]" and [[Doug Kershaw]]'s "[[Diggy Liggy Lo]]",<ref name="encyclopedia"/> as well as another Jackson Browne cover, "Jamaica".<ref name="shine">{{cite news |author=Henry McNulty | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/368444876/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band shines on | work=[[Hartford Courant]] | date=February 19, 1972 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | pages=18}}</ref> The former of these was issued as a single, but peaked in the lower end of the Hot 100.<ref name="whitburn2010"/> ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' writer Henry McNulty found the cover songs superior to the original cuts on the album, but criticized the band for including fake applause between tracks.<ref name="shine"/>

Also in 1972, the band traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to record the album ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken (album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]''. This was a collaborative three-disc album featuring a number of country and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artists, such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Maybelle Carter]], [[Earl Scruggs]], and [[Doc Watson]].<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="encyclopedia"/> Writing for ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', Robert Hillburn thought that the band showed appreciation for the music of the collaborators, and that the album would appeal to music fans who did not like the then-contemporary [[Nashville sound]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/385794163/ | title=If you're dreaming of a Phil Spector Christmas | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 17, 1972 | accessdate=July 9, 2024 | author=Robert Hillburn | pages=70}}</ref> The album also accounted for the band's first entries on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: a cover of Hank Williams's "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]" and the original "Grand Ole Opry Song", respectively featuring guest vocals from Roy Acuff and [[Jimmy Martin]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=260|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref> Following the commercial success of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'', the band began touring across the United States and internationally.

Their next album for United Artists was 1974's ''[[Stars & Stripes Forever (album)|Stars & Stripes Forever]]''. By this point, Thompson had left as well, leaving the band as a quartet.<ref name="allmusic"/> A cover of [[Johnny Horton]]'s "[[The Battle of New Orleans]]" charted from this project.<ref name="whitburn2010"/> The album, composed of both live and studio recordings, also featured interview segments by fiddle player [[Vassar Clements]]. Bruce Eder thought these elements made the album "more than its money's worth" and capable of showing the band's mix of country and rock influences.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/stars-stripes-forever-mw0000644758 | title=''Stars & Stripes Forever'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Bruce Eder}}</ref> A year later, they released ''[[Symphonion Dream]]'', led off by a cover of [[the Everly Brothers]]' "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]".<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="whitburn2010"/> The album featured guest contributions from [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Leon Russell]], and actor [[Gary Busey]].

===1978{{ndash}}1981: The Dirt Band and shift to soft rock===
In 1978, both Clark and Cable left the band, which by this point had shortened its name to just the Dirt Band.<ref name="allmusic"/> McEuen said that the decision to become just the Dirt Band was due to disc jockeys not being comfortable with the longer name.{{sfn|McEuen|2017|pp=163-164}} Conversely, music writer Tom Roland attributed the name change to Chuck Morris, who had taken over as the band's manager due to William E. McEuen becoming overwhelmed by the role.{{sfn|Roland|1991|pp=394-395}} Also according to John McEuen, Clark left voluntarily, while he believes that Hanna "got rid" of Cable because he felt "threatened" by Cable's songwriting ability.{{sfn|McEuen|2017|p=155}} Joining Hanna, John McEuen, and Fadden as members were drummer Merel Bergante, bassist Richard Hathaway, and Al Garth, who played multiple instruments including saxophone and keyboards.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Herbeck |first=Ray Jr. |title=The Dirt Band, Le Roux, Roxy, Los Angeles |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=90 |issue=27 |date=July 8, 1978 |location=New York City |page=40 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/70s/1978/Billboard%201978-07-08-OCR-Page-0040.pdf |access-date=November 25, 2019 }}</ref> The band's first release under the shortened name was 1978's ''[[The Dirt Band (album)|The Dirt Band]]''.<ref name="erlewine dirt">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dirt-band-mw0000345438 | title=''The Dirt Band'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=July 11, 2024 | author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]}}</ref> "In for the Night" reached the lower regions of the Hot 100 as a single from this project.<ref name="whitburn2010"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic thought the album marked a shift in the band's sound to a [[soft rock]] style. He thought the songs on the album were consistent in quality, but also thought that the album would not appeal to fans of their earlier works.<ref name="erlewine dirt"/> Also during 1978, the band appeared under the pseudonym the Toot Uncommons as backing musicians on comedian and actor [[Steve Martin]]'s novelty hit single "[[King Tut (song)|King Tut]]". This appearance was due to William E. McEuen serving as producer on the track.<ref name="allmusic"/>

After this album, [[EMI]] eliminated the United Artists label and reopened Liberty Records, transferring the band back to that label after a decade. Their first release upon returning to Liberty was 1981's ''[[Jealousy (Dirt Band album)|Jealousy]]''. Most of the band members wrote the songs on the album by themselves and Hanna co-produced the album.

In 1983, the band reverted its name to Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Al Garth and Vic Mastrionni both quit the band at this point and Ibbotson rejoined as a vocalist and bass guitarist; as a result, Fadden began playing drums in addition to his existing role as harmonica player. At this point, the band began finding success in [[country music]], a move which McEuen attributed to changing tastes among fans of rock and pop music.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/622388616/ | title=Changing times find Dirt Band walking country road | work=[[The Charlotte Observer]] | date=September 30, 1983 | accessdate=July 11, 2024 | pages=4D}}</ref> Roland also attributes the shift in sound and reversion of their name to Morris;{{sfn|Roland|1991|pp=394-395}} McEuen also attributed both of these and the return of Ibbotson to the lineup as being decisions made by Morris.<ref name="vincennes"/> The first release to be successful on the country charts was "Shot Full of Love", which went to number 19 on the Hot Country Songs charts in 1983.

The band began recording their next album, ''[[Plain Dirt Fashion]]'', while still on Liberty. However, Morris was uncertain if the label would promote the album properly, as it was the last one in their contract. As a result, the band transferred to [[Warner Records]], who released it in 1984.

According to Ibbotson, the band chose to switch producers after moving to Warner, as they thought Putnam and Landis, despite working in country music, "thought they had to cover all bases."<ref name="vincennes"/> In addition to the five members of the band, other contributors included Skaggs and [[Jerry Douglas]]. The project also included a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Cadillac Ranch (Bruce Springsteen song)|Cadillac Ranch]]".<ref name="rickey"/> The lead single was another Rodney Crowell composition, "[[Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper's Dream)]]", which in 1984 became the band's first number-one single on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Also issued as singles were "[[I Love Only You]]" (written by [[Dave Loggins]] and [[Don Schlitz]]) and "[[High Horse (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band song)|High Horse]]" (written by Ibbotson), both of which were top-five country hits between late 1984 and early 1985.<ref name="whitburn"/> Writing for the [[Mattoon, Illinois]], ''Journal Gazette'', Rickey Ferguson thought that the album showed a country influence through the "storytelling lyrics" of "Long Hard Road".<ref name="rickey">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/82773694/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band breaks country barrier | work=The Journal Gazette | date=August 25, 1984 | accessdate=July 11, 2024 | author=Rickey Ferguson | pages=C7}}</ref>

Next on Warner was ''[[Partners, Brothers and Friends (album)|Partners, Brothers and Friends]]'' in 1985.

Upon release, this song became Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's second number-one on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Although Hanna or Carpenter usually sang lead vocals on singles, "Modern Day Romance" was one of several in this timespan to feature Ibbotson on lead vocals instead. Worley noted that the song had originally been submitted to the band for inclusion on ''Plain Dirt Fashion'' but was rejected, and they chose to record it after it was submitted to them a second time.{{sfn|Roland|1991|pp=430-431}} Also charting in the top ten from this album were "[[Home Again in My Heart]]" and the [[Partners, Brothers and Friends (song)|title track]], which Hanna and Ibbotson co-wrote.<ref name="whitburn"/> While not released as a single, the album track "Telluride" (also written by Ibbotson) was made into a music video.

In 1989, the band transferred to [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal Records]], then a new country label started by producer [[Jimmy Bowen]]. Their only release for the label was ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two]]'', a sequel album to their 1972 album ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken''. Like its predecessor, it featured a large number of guest musicians, including [[Johnny Cash]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Levon Helm]], [[Marty Stuart]], and [[Vince Gill]]. Many of the guests appeared on the title track, a cover of [[A. P. Carter]]'s "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]". Earl Scruggs's son, [[Randy Scruggs|Randy]], produced the album.

After Universal closed, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band transferred to [[MCA Nashville Records]] for 1990's ''[[The Rest of the Dream]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> Randy Scruggs also produced this project, and Carpenter observed that the track "Wishing Well" was the first time all four members of the band wrote a song together.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/566662258 | title=24 years of dirt haven't changed Nitty Gritty Dirt Band | work=Spokane Chronicle | date=August 24, 1990 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Lonna Baldwin | pages=4}}</ref> Serving as lead single was another Bruce Springsteen cover, this time of "[[From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)]]".<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/CMJ/1990/CMJ-New-Music-Report-1990-07-06.pdf | title=Short shorts | journal=CMJ New Music Report | pages=36 | date=June 6, 1990}}</ref> Neither this song nor "You Make Life Good Again" was successful on the charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Hanna later stated that covering "From Small Things" and recording a song written by every member of the band were both objectives of his for nearly a decade prior.

Next on Liberty was 1994's ''[[Acoustic (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Acoustic]]'', composed entirely of acoustic songs. Jim Newsom of AllMusic called the album "refreshingly unadorned" and praised the use of instruments such as Dobro and accordion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/acoustic-mw0000624817 | title=''Acoustic'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=July 12, 2024}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Bob Cannon was less favorable, writing, "They’re always competent, with shimmering three-part harmonies and stellar musicianship, but that doesn’t compensate for their generally forgettable songwriting."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/17/acoustic/ | title=''Acoustic'' | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=June 17, 1994 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Bob Cannon}}</ref> Closing track "[[Bless the Broken Road]]", which Hanna wrote with Bobby Boyd and [[Marcus Hummon]], was later recorded by Hummon, [[Melodie Crittenden]], [[Geoff Moore]], and [[Rascal Flatts]], whose version was a number-one single on the country charts in 2005.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1497995/rascal-flatts-takes-bow-for-broken-road.jhtml|title=Rascal Flatts Takes Bow for "Broken Road"|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=March 10, 2005|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|access-date=July 12, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012101112/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1497995/rascal-flatts-takes-bow-for-broken-road.jhtml|archive-date=October 12, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band released no further projects until 1997's ''[[The Christmas Album (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|The Christmas Album]]'' on [[Rising Tide Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> This project contained a mix of traditional Christmas songs and new material mostly written by the band members.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-christmas-album-mw0000596324 | title=''The Christmas Album'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Thom Owens}}</ref> While on Rising Tide, they recorded another album titled ''[[Bang Bang Bang (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Bang Bang Bang]]'', whose title track charted ahead of the album's release. However, the album was delayed due to the closure of Rising Tide and transferred to [[Decca Records]], which also closed before it could be released.

==Musical styles==
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's music encompasses a wide variety of styles. Colin Larkin, in ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', wrote that their early albums contained [[jug band]] and [[Vaudeville]] influences, while by the release of ''Uncle Charlie and His Dog Teddy'', the band "abandoned the jokey elements...[and] pursued a career as purveyors of superior [[country rock]]."<ref name="virgin"/> Mark Deming spoke similarly of their early material, noting influences of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] in the "Mr. Bojangles" cover as well as the tracks from the first ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' album. He also defined the band's late-1970s output as [[soft rock]], and that their 1990s and 21st-century material was indebted to [[American folk music]].<ref name="allmusic"/> On the same site, Stephen Thomas Erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on ''The Dirt Band''.<ref name="erlewine dirt"/> Rickey Ferguson thought the band's country influences were more evident on ''Plain Dirt Fashion'' due to the use of instruments such as [[Dobro]], [[fiddle]], and [[mandolin]].<ref name="rickey"/> Holly Gleason noted the [[twang]] evident in Hanna's and Ibbotson's singing voices, and thought the band's [[rhythm section]]s were stronger than usual for a country band.<ref name="gleason"/>

During the release of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'', the band members were noted for their long-haired appearance, which at the time was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time. [[Bill Monroe]] was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album, and [[Roy Acuff]] was initially apprehensive before joining.<ref name="gone"/> The band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after "An American Dream" and "Make a Little Magic", followed by a realization that members of the country music community in Nashville were still fans of their music.<ref name="gone"/> They also thought that the first two ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' projects helped to "dim the lines" between pop and country, especially since the genre of [[country rock]] was still new when the first one was recorded.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/212741105/ | title='The Circle' still unbroken | work=The Times | date=October 4, 1989 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Troy Moon | pages=6C}}</ref> Walter Tunis of the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' thought that the band was an early example of the California-based country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and that such a comparison was furthered when former Eagles member Bernie Leadon joined. He also thought that the band's success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself. Leadon also stated that he heard influences of the Eagles within the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's songs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/689099284/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band music still has its flavor of '70s | work=Lexington Herald-Leader | date=October 21, 1987 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Walter Tunis | pages=38}}</ref> Jim Wensits of ''[[The South Bend Tribune]]'' described the band as a "coming force in country rock" during the success of "Mr. Bojangles", and added that they "confounded critics by refusing to be categorized." He also thought that the band's sound during the 1970s was comparable to the Eagles, and that some songs such as their cover of "Jambalaya" featured influences of [[Cajun music]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/518398575/ | title=After 20 years, 'Nitty Gritty Band' continues to hit paydirt | work=The South Bend Tribune | date=September 14, 1986 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Jim Wensits | pages=C6}}</ref>

In a 2022 concert review, Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time opined that Jeff Hanna's "voice was well intact at 75" and that he had "an affable, easy going stage presence." He also noted that Jaime Hanna, Carpenter, and Fadden occasionally sang lead vocals as well. He also praised the use of fiddle and mandolin in their live settings.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://countrystandardtime.com/d/concertreview.asp?xid=1640 | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band is forever young | publisher=Country Standard Time | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Jeffrey B.

Struthers was born in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] six months before her family moved to [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon, Conn]]. When Struthers was four years old the family moved again to [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]].

Her family called her Jane, but Nora stuck in school when that name was used for calling roll in kindergarten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norajanestruthers.com/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=Nora Jane Struthers |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>

Struthers said as a little girl she would often watch out the front window for her father at the end of the day and greet him with a yodel and the two frequented bluegrass festivals and fiddler conventions along the East Coast as she got older.<ref name="engine2"/>

Struthers was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of four, when a reading specialist told her parents that Nora Jane would never go to college.<ref name="amysmartgirls1"/> She ultimately proved the reading specialist wrong, however, studying English Education and Africana Studies at New York University's School of Education. After graduating in 2005, Struthers worked as a teacher at The Williamsburg Charter High School in [[Brooklyn]], New York until 2008.<ref name="huffingtonpost1">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-bialas/faces-of-telluride-part-3_b_877219.html |title=Faces of Telluride, Part 3: Nora Jane Struthers, Fresh Face &#124; Michael Bialas |work=HuffPost |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>

'''Patricia Jean Griffin''' (born March 16, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician.<ref name="Griffin">Griffin, Patricia [http://www.pattygriffin.net/PattyBio.html Fan website biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728051703/http://www.pattygriffin.net/PattyBio.html |date=July 28, 2018 }}</ref> She is a vocalist and plays guitar and piano. She is known for her stripped-down songwriting style in the [[folk music]] genre. Her songs have been covered by numerous musicians, including [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Ellis Paul]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Rory Block]], [[Dave Hause]], [[Sugarland]], [[Bette Midler]] and [[The Chicks]].

In 2007, Griffin received the Artist of the Year award from the [[Americana Music Association]], and her album ''[[Children Running Through]]'' won the award for Best Album. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting at the [[2023 Americana Music Honors & Awards]]. In 2011, Griffin's album ''[[Downtown Church]]'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Gospel Album]] and her 2019 [[Patty Griffin (album)|self-titled album]] won the [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]].

==Biography==
Griffin is from [[Old Town, Maine]], United States, next to the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] [[Native American reservation]]. The youngest child in her family, with six older siblings, she bought a guitar for $50 at age 16. She sang and played but had no inclination to become a professional musician. After a 6-year marriage, which ended in 1994, Griffin began playing in Boston coffee houses and was "scouted" by [[A&M Records]], which signed her on the strength of her demo tape. When the finished studio recordings were submitted to A&M, the company executives thought it was overproduced, so producer [[Nile Rodgers]] and A&M instead released a stripped-down reworking of her demo tape as the album ''[[Living with Ghosts]].''<ref name="Harris">Harris, Craig (accessed March 17, 2008) [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=patty griffin|bio=true}} Billboard com]</ref>

Griffin's second album, ''[[Flaming Red]]'', released in 1998, was a departure from the [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound of ''Living with Ghosts'', with a mix of mellow songs and high-tempo [[rock and roll]] songs. The title track, "Flaming Red", is an example of the latter, beginning with an even beat until it increases to a fevered pitch of emotion. Another song from the album, "Tony", is also featured on the charity benefit album ''[[Live in the X Lounge]]''.

Her third album, ''[[Silver Bell (album)|Silver Bell]]'', has a sound similar to its predecessor. It was released by A&M in 2013, 13 years after it was recorded (and well after bootlegged copies had been circulated). A&M dropped Griffin's contract after ''Silver Bell'' was recorded, and she was then signed by [[Dave Matthews]]' [[ATO Records]]. Griffin re-recorded songs from that album for later releases, such as "Making Pies", "Mother of God", "Standing", and "[[Top of the World (Dixie Chicks song)|Top of the World]]". Copies of the unreleased ''Silver Bell'' were leaked and bootlegged and can be easily acquired by the B&P ([[blanks and postage]]) method on [[message boards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pattynet.net/forum/|title=PattyNet • Index page|website=Pattynet.net|access-date=March 9, 2019|archive-date=January 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105172653/http://pattynet.net/forum/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In August 2013, it was announced that [[Universal Music Enterprises|UM<sup>e</sup>]] planned to release ''Silver Bell'', mixed by producer [[Glyn Johns]], in October 2013.<ref name="Billboard 20130731">{{cite magazine|last=Votaw|first=Emily|title=Patty Griffin's Lost 'Silver Bell' Album to Be Released in October|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 31, 2013|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5327862/patty-griffins-lost-silver-bell-album-to-be-released-in-october|access-date=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

Four albums followed on ATO: ''[[1000 Kisses (album)|1000 Kisses]]'' (2002), ''[[A Kiss in Time]]'' (2003), ''[[Impossible Dream (Patty Griffin album)|Impossible Dream]]'' (2004), and ''[[Children Running Through]]'' (2007).

In 2004, Griffin toured with Emmylou Harris, [[Buddy Miller]], [[Gillian Welch]] and [[David Rawlings]] as the [[Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue]]. On February 6, 2007, she released ''[[Children Running Through]]''.

'''Poco''' was an American [[country rock]] band originally formed in 1968 after the demise of [[Buffalo Springfield]]. Guitarists [[Richie Furay]] and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], former members of Buffalo Springfield, were joined by multi-instrumentalist [[Rusty Young (musician)|Rusty Young]], bassist [[Randy Meisner]] and drummer [[George Grantham (musician)|George Grantham]].  Meisner quit the band while they were recording their first album, ''[[Pickin' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin' Up the Pieces]]'', though his bass and backing vocal parts were kept in the final mix.  He was replaced by [[Timothy B. Schmit]] in 1969, and Messina left in 1970 to be replaced by [[Paul Cotton]].  The line-up would change numerous times over the next several decades, with Rusty Young being the only constant member.  A reunion of the founding members occurred in the late 1980s-early 1990s, and the band continued in some form through 2021, though they retired from active touring in 2013, with Young citing health concerns as the primary cause of his retirement. Young died from a heart attack in April 2021.

To date, the band has released 19 studio albums, the most successful of which was 1978's ''[[Legend (Poco album)|Legend]]'', which featured the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] #17 and Adult Contemporary #1 hit "[[Crazy Love (Poco song)|Crazy Love]]". The band's last album was ''[[All Fired Up (Poco album)|All Fired Up]]'' in 2013.

Poco are considered one of the founders of the Southern California country rock sound, and three of the members of the band have been inducted in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as members of other bands (Furay with Buffalo Springfield, Meisner and Schmit with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). However, the band has yet to receive a nomination since entering eligibility in 1995.

==History==

===Inception===
During recording of [[Buffalo Springfield]]'s third and final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', lead singers [[Stephen Stills]], [[Neil Young]] and [[Richie Furay]] each recorded songs without the other members present.  One of Furay's solo efforts was the country-influenced ballad "Kind Woman", which he recorded with the help of producer/engineer/bassist [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] and [[pedal steel guitar]]ist [[Rusty Young (musician)|Rusty Young]].<ref name="Eder">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poco-mn0000297894/biography
|work=allmusic.com|title=Poco|first= Bruce|last= Eder}}</ref>

When Buffalo Springfield split up, Furay, Messina and Rusty Young decided to start their own group oriented toward such songs. Its original line-up was Furay (vocals and [[rhythm guitar]]), Messina ([[lead guitar]], vocals, producer), Rusty Young ([[pedal steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, mandolin and vocals), [[George Grantham (musician)|George Grantham]] ([[drum kit|drums]] and vocals) and [[Randy Meisner]] ([[bass guitar|bass]] and vocals). The group was signed to a recording contract with [[Epic Records]], which acquired the rights to Furay from the Springfield's [[Atlantic Records]] subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] label in return for those to [[Graham Nash]] of [[The Hollies]] (who was moving to Atlantic as part of forming [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]]).<ref name=Eder /> Originally, the new group was named "Pogo", after the [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo comic strip]] character, but was changed when its creator, [[Walt Kelly]], objected and threatened to sue.

===Furay era (1969–1973)===
Their debut, ''[[Pickin' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin' Up the Pieces]]'' (1969), is considered a pioneering album of the country rock genre.<ref>Eder, Bruce.  [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=poco|chart=all}} ''Pickin' Up the Pieces'' review], ''[[Allmusic]]''</ref> The first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide edited by [[Dave Marsh]] and John Swenson, gave the release 5 stars, its highest rating, as an essential album. However, the album performed weakly, peaking at No.&nbsp;63 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|album chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The band's line-up proved to be a problem throughout its career. During the recording of the debut album, Meisner left the group as a result of a conflict with Furay (reportedly, Meisner had objected after Furay barred all but himself and Messina from the first album's final mix playback sessions).<ref>Eliot, Marc. ''To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles''. Da Capo Press, 2004. p.37. {{ISBN|978-0-306-81398-6}}</ref> After a stint playing with [[Ricky Nelson]]'s Stone Canyon Band, Meisner later became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Messina briefly took over on bass until [[Timothy B. Schmit]] joined the band in September 1969.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Their second studio album ''[[Poco (album)|Poco]]'' (1970) again resulted in low sales, peaking at No.&nbsp;58. However, the band's next album, the live set ''[[Deliverin']]'' (or ''DeLIVErin''' as it is sometimes represented), picked up moderate airplay, Furay's "C'mon" hitting No.&nbsp;69. ''Deliverin’'' became Poco's first album to reach the [[Top 40]] on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No.&nbsp;26.

Messina chose to leave the band in October 1970, feeling Furay exerted too much control over the group's sound. He also was anxious to get off the road and return to his career in studio production. This would lead him ultimately on to [[Loggins & Messina]]. At the recommendation of [[Peter Cetera]] of [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], Messina selected guitarist/singer [[Paul Cotton]], a one-time member of the [[Illinois Speed Press]], to replace him.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The realigned Poco, now on its third line-up on just its fourth album, hired [[Steve Cropper]] as [[record producer|producer]] and released ''[[From the Inside (Poco album)|From the Inside]]'' (1971). Again, poor sales were the result as the release landed at No.&nbsp;52.

The band and its management were dissatisfied with Cropper's production and hired Canadian  [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]], who'd had big success with [[The Guess Who]] and oversaw the next three albums, beginning with ''[[A Good Feelin' to Know]]'' (1972). The band built the LP around the title track, a popular concert tune, but the single failed to chart. The album itself peaked at No.&nbsp;69. As a result, Furay became increasingly discouraged with Poco's prospects, especially since ex-bandmates Stills, Young, Meisner and Messina were so successful with their respective groups. In an April 26, 1973 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interview with [[Cameron Crowe]], he vented that Poco was still a second-billed act and had not increased its audience.

The next album, ''[[Crazy Eyes]]'' (1973), reached No.&nbsp;38 but Furay departed at its release and joined with [[JD Souther]] and [[Chris Hillman]] to create the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]] on [[Asylum Records]].  Poco decided not to replace Furay and continued as a quartet.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Post-Furay era (1973–1977)===
After Furay's departure, the band released their last two albums with Epic; ''[[Seven (Poco album)|Seven]]'' (1974) and ''[[Cantamos]]'' (1974). The albums charted at No.&nbsp;68 and No.&nbsp;76 respectively. Poco left Epic after ''Cantamos'' and signed with [[ABC-Dunhill Records]].

''[[Head Over Heels (Poco album)|Head Over Heels]]'' was their first ABC release, featuring Schmit's acoustic "Keep On Tryin" which became the group's most successful single to date, charting at No.&nbsp;50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Around the time of the release of ''Head Over Heels'', ''[[The Very Best of Poco (1975 album)|The Very Best of Poco]]'' was released as a [[compilation album]] that documented the group's years with Epic.  Epic's release fought with ''Head Over Heels'' for attention though neither charted very well, hitting No.&nbsp;43 and No.&nbsp;90, respectively.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The group's next ABC album was ''[[Rose of Cimarron (album)|Rose Of Cimarron]]'' which also failed to generate much enthusiasm and peaked at No.&nbsp;89. Another Epic release also came out in 1976, the live album ''[[Live (Poco album)|Live]]''.

Al Garth (ex-[[Loggins and Messina]]), who guested on ''Head Over Heels'' and ''Rose of Cimarron'', was added to the group's 1976 touring line up on sax and violin, but was gone by the end of that year.

In the summer of 1976, the group was on the bill with the [[Stills-Young Band]] teaming but was left high and dry when [[Neil Young]] pulled out of the tour, which was then canceled.

''[[Indian Summer (Poco album)|Indian Summer]]'' was released the following spring, peaking at No.&nbsp;57, while the title track reached No.&nbsp;50.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The appearance of [[Steely Dan]]'s [[Donald Fagen]] playing synthesizer on two of the album's tracks marked a move away from the country rock sound the band had primarily been known for.

===Success (1977–1980)===
In August 1977 Schmit quit to join the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], coincidentally replacing former Poco member Meisner yet again.  As a result, a fully produced live album recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles in July 1977 was shelved by ABC.  After languishing in storage for many years, the album was eventually released by John Thaler and Futuredge Music in partnership with Universal Special Projects as ''[[The Last Roundup (Poco)|The Last Roundup]]'' in 2004.

After Schmit's departure, Poco decided to take a break. Grantham took some time off, while Young and Cotton decided to continue as the Cotton-Young Band and redoubled their efforts to succeed.  They selected the Britons Steve Chapman ([[Drum kit|drums]]) and Charlie Harrison ([[bass guitar|bass]], backing vocals; formerly of [[Judas Jump]]), both of whom had played together with [[Leo Sayer]] and [[Al Stewart]], to round out their new quartet.  However, ABC decided to pick up the Cotton-Young album  — as long as they continued under the Poco name. Thus, although Grantham had never quit Poco, he found himself bought out of the group after he was not happy with the changes in its business setup, including the group's publishing no longer being divided evenly. After a stint with [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]], he subsequently landed a job as drummer for [[Ricky Skaggs]].

''[[Legend (Poco)|Legend]]'' (1978), the Cotton-Young album with cover art by graphic artist (and later comedy actor) [[Phil Hartman]], subsequently became the group's most commercially successful LP, containing two Top 20 hits, "[[Crazy Love (Poco song)|Crazy Love]]" written and sung by Rusty Young (which also had a seven-week run at Number 1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary chart]] in early 1979, the biggest hit on the AC chart that year) and Cotton's "[[Heart of the Night (song)|Heart of the Night]]".  The album was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]], Poco's first album to achieve this distinction in original distribution.

[[Kim Bullard]] ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], backing vocals) joined the band in December 1978 just after ''Legend'' was released.  While "Crazy Love" was riding up the charts in early 1979, ABC Records was sold to [[MCA Records]].  Poco was retained by MCA and the ''Legend'' album was reissued on the MCA label.

With the momentum built up from ''Legend'''s success, Poco were invited by the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) collective to play during their concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] in September 1979. And their new hit "Heart of the Night" appeared on the resulting live album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', the concerts and album all being in support of nuclear-free energy. Both the concerts and the album also featured several other big artists such as [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Jackson Browne]].

===1980–1999===
[[Image:JimMessina(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|238px|right|[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], founding member of Poco, performing in 2009]]
During the first half of the 1980s, the group released five more albums: ''[[Under the Gun (Poco album)|Under the Gun]]'' (1980), ''[[Blue And Gray]]'' (1981), ''[[Cowboys & Englishmen]]'' (1982) on MCA and, moving over to [[Atlantic Records]], ''[[Ghost Town (Poco)|Ghost Town]]'' (1982) and ''[[Inamorata (Poco)|Inamorata]]'' (1984). Poco failed to duplicate the success achieved by ''Legend'', with each album performing more poorly than its predecessor.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Poco also contributed the song "I'll Leave it Up to You" to ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'''s soundtrack in 1982.

On ''Inamorata'' the band mostly played down their "[[Country rock]]" sound to adopt more of an "80s style" with more keyboards and glossy synth sounds as well as electronic drums. The album also featured guest spots by former members Timothy B. Schmit, Richie Furay and George Grantham.

The group lost its recording contract with Atlantic due to the slow sales of ''Inamorata'' but continued to tour, mostly in small clubs. Bullard left to rejoin [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] in 1983 (but still appeared on the sessions for ''Inamorata'')   and Harrison (who had not played on ''Inamorata'') departed in mid-1984. New members Jeff Steele (bass) and Rick Seratte (keyboards, backing vocals) came in for Poco's 1984 tour dates, but they departed, along with drummer Chapman, to be replaced in 1985 by future [[Great Plains (Tennessee band)|Great Plains]] front man Jack Sundrud (vocals, bass, guitar) and the returning Grantham. Grantham's reunion with Poco was brief, though; In late 1985, [[Steve Wariner]] asked him to join his band. Chapman came back to take over drums again. During this period, the band  relocated to [[Nashville]] and recorded some demos, though no record deal resulted. And after a few scattered live dates for the group in 1986 and 1987, Paul Cotton pursued a solo career and did not perform with Poco again until 1992, while Young played in [[Vince Gill]]'s band.

After a lengthy recording hiatus, at the urging of [[Richard Marx]] and his manager Allen Kovac who took on Poco, the band re-emerged on the [[RCA]] label with the successful ''[[Legacy (Poco)|Legacy]]'' (1989), reuniting original members Young, Furay, Messina, Grantham and Meisner twenty years after Poco's debut. Though Timothy B. Schmit and Paul Cotton were also approached to appear on the project, Schmit declined and Cotton, who was busy with his solo career, was bought out of the group and it ended up being only the five originals. The album produced a Top 20 hit, "Call It Love," in the fall of 1989 and another Top 40 hit, "Nothing to Hide," in early 1990, earning Poco its second gold album (in its 19th release).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The group (having added a keyboardist, Dave Vanacore) toured in early 1990 opening for Marx and appeared at [[Farm Aid]] IV on April 7, 1990, at the [[Hoosier Dome]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. But Furay, now a church minister in Colorado, then had to bow out due to his commitments and Poco toured as a headliner in the summer of 1990 with Sundrud returning to take over rhythm guitar from Furay.

Despite ''Legacy'''s gold status and the two hit singles, the band did not make much money on their 1990 tour, one of the problems being their booking into military bases that turned out to be mostly empty, as the troops were all deployed for the [[Desert Shield]] operation in the [[Persian Gulf]]. RCA ended up dropping them from their roster and recordings for a proposed follow up to ''Legacy'' were abandoned.

In 1991 Poco toured as an acoustic trio with Young, Messina and Meisner (drummer [[Gary Mallaber]] joined them for dates in Japan that July), mostly to make up dates that were missed the previous year. But by the end of 1991, Messina and Meisner had returned to their individual careers.

After Messina and Meisner left, Young formed a side project, Four Wheel Drive, with [[John Cowan]] (from [[New Grass Revival]]), [[Foster & Lloyd|Bill Lloyd]] (from [[Foster & Lloyd]]) and [[Patrick Simmons]] (of [[Doobie Brothers]]). They were signed to a recording deal with [[RCA Records|RCA Nashville]] and completed an album which was never released. [[Warner Bros. Records]] then picked up the group in 1993, but when they were threatened with lawsuits from bands who had already copyrighted the name Four Wheel Drive, they changed the band's name to [[The Sky Kings]]. But their one and only album (minus Simmons who left when the Doobies schedule got too busy), completed in 1997, was not released until 2000, three years after the group disbanded.

In the meantime, Rusty Young was the sole owner of the Poco name by early 1992 and, though they had not officially disbanded, the band seemed to be quietly fading away. Despite this, Young once again teamed with Cotton, brought in new members Richard Neville (vocals, bass) and Tim Smith (drums) and toured through the end of the decade, although on a very limited schedule. Young and Cotton also occasionally appeared as Poco as an acoustic duo.

On September 16, 1995, Poco appeared at Deadwood Jam in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], where former Loggins & Messina drummer Merel Bregante filled in for Tim Smith.

===2000–2013===
Poco again became more active as a touring unit after they signed with Nashville manager Rick Alter and brought back Grantham and Sundrud in June 2000, reuniting the group's 1985 line-up.

''[[Running Horse]]'' (2002) found the band in the studio for the first time in thirteen years. The CD was released through the band's website. Furay, who had continued to make guest appearances at their shows over the years when they played in his adopted home-state of Colorado, reunited with the band again for a sold-out show in Nashville in May 2004, resulting in the CD–DVD release ''[[Keeping the Legend Alive]]'' (2004).

On July 29 of that same year, during a show at [[Stearns Square]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Grantham suffered a [[stroke]] during the performance. For their gig the following night at [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable]] County Fair in [[East Falmouth]], MA, Poco brought in local drummer Chuck Woodhams, then called Young's Nashville neighbor, [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] drummer George Lawrence (who had earlier stood in for Tim Smith at some Poco concerts in June 1999) to sub on drums for Grantham for the rest of 2004. He became a permanent member in 2005. Grantham's recovery was slow and expensive and the group created a donor fund on its official website, Poconut.org, to offset some of his considerable medical expenses.

Poco continued to write and record while performing at festivals, performing arts centers, theaters and clubs.  In 2005 they played a short tour in Europe, but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour. Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd, of duo [[Foster & Lloyd]], substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US.

Cotton returned in 2006, stabilizing the line-up of Young, Cotton, Sundrud and drummer George Lawrence. Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums and Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band. Poco alumni continued to periodically reunite in concert with this line-up.

Beginning in 2009, Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only.  Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in [[Steelville, Missouri]], a tour of California in 2009 ending at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] in Indio (where they were joined by Grantham and Timothy B. Schmit) and several dates opening for [[Loggins and Messina]] featuring Furay, Messina and Grantham.

''[[Bareback at Big Sky]]'' (2005) and  ''[[The Wildwood Sessions]]'' (2006) captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40-plus year career.   ''Live at Columbia Studios, Hollywood 9/30/71'' (2010) unearthed an unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay, Young, Schmit, Grantham and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends.

In early 2010, Paul Cotton left Poco abruptly, publicly citing a financial dispute with Young. On his official website he announced he would not be appearing with Poco at the Wildwood concerts, stating "It was not all that shocking when Rusty told me on February 27 that he would not honor the contract that I had been requesting for over 15 years and that this was goodbye..." On March 12, 2010, Young responded on Poco's official website: "It was a sad day when I read on Paul's website that he wasn't coming to Wildwood and I guess that means he's leaving the band." Poco immediately reformed with Young, Sundrud, Lawrence and new keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist/singer Michael Webb of [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

The band's new incarnation continued to tour and record. In early 2012, a live video of a new song, "Neil Young", was released on YouTube as a teaser for a new studio album, ''[[All Fired Up (Poco album)|All Fired Up]]'', that was recorded in Nashville and released in March 2013. Selling on [[iTunes]], the band's website and through a distributor in Europe, Young, Sundrud and Webb penned all the songs on the self-produced album.

In its 45th year, Rusty Young was the only original member in the band and remained the leader and front man on stage.  He has been the only member of Poco to have performed at every gig and played on every recording since the band's inception in 1968.

===Retirement===
At the end of 2013, Rusty Young announced his retirement. At the age of 68, he said he had spent 45 years on the road in the same band and needed a break. A few shows were booked into 2014, including three farewell shows in Florida. One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD documentary of the band's live show. Young said there could be some one-offs in the future after that, but the band would not be actively touring as before. Young was finishing his memoirs for a book to be published. He and Sundrud wrote and recorded music for children's story videos as the "Session Cats". Lawrence, Sundrud and Webb continued to write, record and play in their own projects, and to do freelance work with other artists in Nashville, where they live. Young continued to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists.

Poco was inducted into the [http://CMHOF.org/ Colorado Music Hall of Fame] (CMHOF) with the CMHOF induction ceremony which took place at the [[Paramount Theatre (Denver, Colorado)]] on January 9, 2015, and included a performance by the following line-up of band members: Paul Cotton, Richie Furay, Timothy B. Schmit, and Rusty Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Eagles-Bassist-Timothy-B-Schmit-to-Reunite-with-Poco-at-Paramount-Theater-in-Denver-20141229|title=Eagles Bassist Timothy B. Schmit to Reunite with Poco at Paramount Theater in Denver|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref>  Also inducted into the CMHOF along with Poco were [[Firefall]], [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] and [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]].

From 2015 through 2021, though not touring full-time, Poco continued to play isolated dates around the US. In 2016 drummer Lawrence was replaced by Rick Lonow (formerly of [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]). Lex Browning, Jack Sundrud's former bandmate in [[Great Plains (Tennessee band)|Great Plains]], replaced Michael Webb on guitar in the fall of 2018.

In early 2020, Poco friend and fan Tom Hampton was brought in by Sundrud to replace Browning for tour dates, but touring was suddenly halted in March due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tomhampton.com/bio.html | title=Tom hampton - bio }}</ref>

Rusty Young died on April 14, 2021, at his home in Davisville, Missouri, from a heart attack.

Fans and surviving band members have released the tribute album ''My Friend: A Tribute To Rusty Young'', in March 2022 and there was a reunion/tribute "Poconut" concert on October 8, 2022, in [[Steelville, Missouri]], near Young's home, where the surviving members of the band's final lineup, Jack Sundrud, Tom Hampton and Rick Lonow, were joined by original drummer George Grantham, who guested on harmony vocals, and Michael Kelsh.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=[[Blue Ėlan Records]]| title=Rusty Young| date=2022| url=https://blueelan.com/collections/rusty-young/products/my-friend-a-tribute-to-rusty-young-digital-album| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220313181020/https://blueelan.com/collections/rusty-young/products/my-friend-a-tribute-to-rusty-young-digital-album| archive-date=March 13, 2022| accessdate=March 12, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=Wildwood Springs Lodge| date=2022| title=Poconut Reunion, Oct. 8, 2022| url=https://wildwoodspringssales.com/concerts/2016-concert-series/poconut-reunion-oct-8-2022/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220313175352/https://wildwoodspringssales.com/concerts/2016-concert-series/poconut-reunion-oct-8-2022/| archive-date=March 13, 2022| accessdate=March 12, 2022}}</ref>  It is unclear if this performance can be considered the final performance by Poco or if that technically occurred prior to Rusty Young's death in 2021.

===Selected studio reissues===
In 1997 ''[[From the Inside (Poco album)|From the Inside]]'' and ''[[A Good Feelin' to Know]]'' were reissued on CD by [[BGO Records|BGO]], a British label. However, the reissue had some problems, as it appeared the tape used to remaster ''From the Inside'' had significant damage to it. ''[[Pickin' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin' Up the Pieces]]'' and ''[[Poco (album)|Poco]]'', the band's first and second albums, were also reissued during this time, with no noticeable damage to the master tapes. The notes give a brief history of the band and the recording of each album.

In 2006 BGO reissued four more albums, with two albums on each CD: ''[[Seven (Poco album)|Seven]]'' with ''[[Cantamos]]'', the band's seventh and eighth albums, and ''[[Deliverin']]'', the band's first live album, with ''[[Crazy Eyes]]''. Neither set had any bonus tracks as part of the reissue, although there are extensive sleeve notes about Poco's history and the making of the album. The reissues were remastered by Jack Thompson, although it does not note whether or not these were remastered from the original master tapes or the safety masters as previous CDs were.

In 2011 BGO licensed and reissued remastered editions of four of Poco's ABC/MCA titles, again remastered by Thompson, putting two albums on each CD, with extensive liner notes written by John Tobler. The pairings were ''[[Head over Heels (Poco album)|Head over Heels]]'' with ''[[Rose of Cimarron (album)|Rose of Cimarron]]'', and ''[[Under the Gun (Poco album)|Under the Gun]]'' with ''[[Blue and Gray (album)|Blue and Gray]]''. No bonus tracks or outtakes were included.

'''Railroad Earth''' is a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-influenced Americana  band formed in [[Stillwater Township, New Jersey|Stillwater, New Jersey]] in 2001.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/26/135709833/railroad-earth-on-mountain-stage|title=Railroad Earth On Mountain Stage|publisher=[[NPR|NPR.org]]|date=24 January 2012|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> The band's music combines elements of [[progressive bluegrass]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[Celtic music|Celtic]] and other [[Americana (music)|Americana]] influences.

==History==
{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}
The band was originally formed in 2001, and was composed of vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Todd Sheaffer, violinist/vocalist Tim Carbone, mandolinist John Skehan, multi-instrumentalist Andy Goessling, drummer/vocalist Carey Harmon, and bassist Dave Von Dollen. Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and [[New Jersey]] rock outfit [[Kings in Disguise]]. When rehearsals of original music, mostly written by Sheaffer, began occurring, the band soon realized that something musically unique was happening. After three weeks of rehearsing, they went into a local recording studio to track a five-song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |title=Railroad Earth &#124; Pollstar - the Concert Hotwire |access-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810131640/http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and ''[[The Black Bear Sessions]]'' was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride. That album contains what are still some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including "Seven Story Mountain," "Head" and, of course, "Railroad Earth."

The band was approached by [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] after seeing their performance at Telluride. Right after their show, Railroad Earth was offered a record deal on the spot.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In June 2002, Railroad Earth released its follow-up album on Sugar Hill titled ''[[Bird in a House]]'', featuring such enduring songs as "Like A Buddha," "Mighty River," and the album's title track. Throughout that year Railroad Earth's touring schedule increased dramatically and their growing fanbase began to emerge as something tangible to promoters, radio stations and other media. They were garnering raves for their unique sound and exciting live shows and had become a staple act on the line-up of any roots, folk or [[jam-band]] festival. Their fans, who were now calling themselves "Hobos," began to grow quickly in number, and the venues were getting larger along with them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In late March 2003, Dave Von Dollen was replaced by Atlanta-based bassist Johnny Grubb. The following year, the band released its third studio effort, ''[[The Good Life (Railroad Earth album)|The Good Life]]'', featuring "Storms", "Mourning Flies" and "Goat".  The band continued to tour throughout the country, and its first live album, ''[[Elko (album)|Elko]]'', was issued in late January 2006. They performed at the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] on September 15, 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://livemusicblog.com/news/2007-austin-city-limits-music-festival-lineup/|title = 2007 Austin City Limits Music Festival Lineup - LIVE music blog|newspaper = Live Music Blog|date = 10 May 2007}}</ref>

The band's fourth studio album, titled ''Amen Corner'', was released on June 10, 2008. The album features songs such as "Been Down This Road," "Hard Livin'," "[[The Forecast]]," and "[[Lovin' You]]."

On November 11, 2009, Grubb announced his departure from the band after Railroad Earth's New Year's Eve run of shows in [[Portland, Oregon]]. In February 2010, Andrew Altman of the [[Codetalkers]] and Blueground Undergrass was named as his successor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notreble.com/buzz/2010/02/12/railroad-earth-recruits-andrew-altman/|title = Railroad Earth recruits Andrew Altman|date = 12 February 2010}}</ref>

The band's self-titled, fifth album was released on Oct 12, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/railroad-earth-take-my-hand|title = Railroad Earth: Take My Hand}}</ref> The album featured new songs from Todd Sheaffer including "Jupiter and the 119" and " Too Much Information"  plus an 11-minute instrumental, written by John Skehan, "Spring-Heeled Jack." It is the second-longest studio track to date for the band.

In February 2013 Railroad Earth performed at the Jefferson Theatre at the University of Virginia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2013/02/railroad-earth-chugs-into-charlottesville|title=Railroad Earth chugs into Charlottesville|website=Cavalierdaily.com|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> and at Workplay in Birmingham, Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/02/bluegrass_jamgrass_whatever_it.html|title=Bluegrass?

On January 14, 2014, Railroad Earth released their seventh album, ''Last of the Outlaws'', to rave reviews from media and fans alike. It featured the 21-minute-long "suite" of "All That's Dead May Live Again" and "Face With a Hole" both written by Todd Sheaffer, and featured instrumental movements written by John Skehan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relix.com/reviews/detail/railroad_earth_last_of_the_outlaws|title=Railroad Earth: Last of the Outlaws - Relix Media|date=10 January 2014|website=Relix.com|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> In the tour that followed Railroad Earth headlined [[Red Rocks]] for the second time, selling out, and with the help of the Mile High Horns (arranged by Jay Rattman). The result can be seen on the DVD ''Live at Red Rocks''.

Railroad Earth backed [[Warren Haynes]] on February 3, 2015 for a taping of the PBS series ''Front and Center'' for airing in May 2015. There were also studio Haynes tracks recorded with Railroad Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/123883/Warren-Haynes-and-Railroad-Earth-Front-and-Center-TV-Taping|title=Warren Haynes & Railroad Earth Front & Center TV Taping|date=29 January 2015|website=Jambase.com|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

In May 2018, Railroad Earth released a 7" vinyl EP in collaboration with the [[John Denver]] estate called ''Railroad Earth: The John Denver Letters''. The project included lyrics penned by [[John Denver]] with music composed by Todd Sheaffer and performed by Railroad Earth. The album was released on Earth Day and a portion of proceeds went to benefit Youth Climate Strike in honor of both artists commitment to the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://liveforlivemusic.com/news/railroad-earth-john-denver-2019/|title=Railroad Earth Announces 'The John Denver Letters', Shares New Single "If You Will be My Lady" &#91;Watch&#93;|date=18 April 2019}}</ref>

The members of Railroad Earth have also released numerous solo albums. In 2009, Skehan released a duet album with mandolinist Todd Collins, performing the eighteenth-century Italian sonatas of [[Emanuele Barbella]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2009/07/28/john-skehan-and-todd-collins-perform-mandolin-duets-of-emanuele-barbella|access-date=2015-04-27|website=Jambands.com|title=John Skehan and Todd Collins perform mandolin duets of Emanuele Barbella|date=28 July 2009}}</ref> In 2010 Carbone co-founded the jamband supergroup The Contribution with Keith Moseley and Jason Hann of [[String Cheese Incident]] along with Jeff Miller and Phil Ferlino of [[New Monsoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/21822/The-Contribution-Carbone-Miller-Moseley-Hann-Ferlino|access-date=2015-04-27|title=The Contribution: Carbone, Miller, Moseley, Hann, Ferlino|website=Jambase.com}}</ref> Carbone has also produced albums by many bands, including [[Greensky Bluegrass]] and [[Great American Taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/features/2009/03/26/tim-carbone-the-producer-serving-the-song|website=Jambands.com|title=Tim Carbone: Producer Serving the Song|date=26 March 2009|access-date=2015-04-27}}</ref> In 2015 Carbone contributed to ''[[Waywords and Meansigns]]'', a collaborative project setting James Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' to music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/jam-bands-experimental-music-and-james-joyce-finnegans-wake-set-music-unabridged|title=Jam Bands, Experimental Music, and James Joyce|website=Gratefulweb.com|access-date=2015-04-27}}</ref>

Andy Goessling (born Andrew James Goessling on February 5, 1959) died of cancer on October 12, 2018, at age 59, as announced by the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://railroad.earth/news/loving-memory-our-friend-family-and-bandmate-andy-goessling|title=Railroad Earth: In Loving Memory of Our Friend, Family, and Bandmate Andy Goessling|date=18 October 2018|access-date=21 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://baileyfuneral.com/tribute/details/2537/Andrew-Goessling/obituary.html|title=In Memory of Andrew James Goessling 1959 - 2018|date=October 2018|access-date=21 October 2018}}</ref>

After a succession of special guests throughout 2019, the band has settled on a new touring ensemble featuring [[Matt Slocum (keyboardist)|Matthew D.

'''Romantica''' are an [[Americana (music)|Americana]] band formed in 2002 by [[Ben Kyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bialas|first=Michael|title=After Sleeping on It, Ben Kyle Gets His Solo Act Together|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-bialas/ben-kyle-music_b_2119644.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=2012-11-14}}</ref>  The band's members, past and present, have come from the [[Minneapolis]]-[[St. Paul (city)|St. Paul]], [[Twin Cities]] area of [[Minnesota]].

While the group's members and contributors have changed over the years, Kyle's vision, vocals and songwriting have been the consistent thread throughout the different iterations. To date, the band has recorded four albums (Three studio, and one live session album).

==History==

===2002-2006===
The band's first album, ''It's your Weakness That I Want'', brings together Americana with an Irish rock flair.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christman|first=Philip|title=Romantica - It's Your Weakness That I Want|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2004/08/romantica-its-your-weakness-that-i-want.html|publisher=Paste|accessdate=July 12, 2013|date=July 2008}}</ref>  The album, produced by Alex Oana, won the band a [[Minnesota Music Academy]] award for ''Best Folk/Roots/Americana Recording'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oana|first=Alex|title=Selected Discography|url=http://www.alexoana.com/disc.html|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref>   Christopher Becknell left the band during this first recording and was replaced by [[Jessy Greene]] (founding member of [[Geraldine Fibbers]] and collaborator with [[The Foo Fighters]], [[Wilco]] and [[The Jayhawks]]). Other significant contributors to this recording included [[Susan Enan]], Darren Jackson, and Erik Applewick of the band [[Tapes and Tapes]]. The live band, for much of this period, also included Erik Brandt, Jeremy Szopinski, and Peter Rasmussen.

===2007-2009===
Romantica's second studio recording ''America'' was produced by Ben Kyle at Slow Studios and went on to be named #58 on [[Paste magazine|Paste]] Magazines "Top 100 Albums of 2007".<ref>{{cite web|first=|title=Signs of Life 2007: Best Music|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/11/signs-of-life-2007-best-music-1.html|publisher=Paste|accessdate=July 12, 2013|date=July 2008}}</ref>   James Orvis joined the band as drummer for this recording, and in addition to Kyle, Jacobs and Greene, significant contributors to the sound and shape of this project included pedal steel guitar player Eric Heywood (of [[Ray LaMontagne]] and the Pariah Dogs fame), guitarist Peter Rasmussen, and vocalist Laurie Kyle. Tony Zaccardi joined as bass guitar player after the recording. The core touring band for the next three years (2007 - 2010) was Zaccardi, James Orvis, Luke Jacobs and Kyle. While on tour in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in 2009, this instantiation of Romantica wrote and recorded the album ''Control Alt Country Delete''  live, in the space of one day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Control Alt Country Delete|url=http://romantica.bandcamp.com/album/control-alt-country-delete|publisher=Bandcamp|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}</ref>  Joe Savage joined 2008, frequently contributing to the live show.

===2010-Onwards===
In 2010, Kyle recorded a duets album with frequent touring partner [[Carrie Rodriguez]] and toured Europe playing Romantica's music as a duo with Luke Jacobs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bialas|first=Michael|title=After Sleeping on It, Ben Kyle Gets His Solo Act Together|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-bialas/ben-kyle-music_b_2119644.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=2012-11-14}}</ref> In 2010, James Orvis retired and was replaced by Ryan Lovan. "Danger" Dave Strahan joined as significant live contributor in the same year. In 2011 Aaron Fabbrini and [[Jayanthi Kyle]] joined the live show as well.

==Personnel==
Over 15 musicians have performed live as a part of Romantica. Some have spent only a short time with the band, contributing to a single tour or album, while others have been long-term members with significant contributions. Kyle has been the band's lead vocalist, motivating force, and sole songwriter throughout the group's history, but a number of other musicians are closely identified with the band.

'''David Ryan Adams''' (born November 5, 1974) is an American [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter. He has released 29 studio albums and three as a former member of [[Whiskeytown]].

In 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'', to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single "[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his label [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.

After breaking his wrist during a live performance, Ryan Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called [[Ryan Adams & the Cardinals|The Cardinals]], who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from [[Ménière's disease]], Adams disbanded The Cardinals and took a break from music.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryan-adams-announces-split-from-the-cardinals-hiatus-20090114 |title=Ryan Adams announces split from the cardinals, hiatus|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref> However, he returned to the music scene in 2010, releasing his 13th studio album, ''[[Ashes & Fire]]''. Adams continued his musical journey by releasing his 14th album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'' in 2014.

In 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swift's]] album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums. Adams later issued an apology and eventually released six  more albums between 2020 and 2022. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Jenny Lewis]], and [[Fall Out Boy]], and has collaborated with [[Counting Crows]], [[Weezer]], [[Norah Jones]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Leona Naess]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[Beth Orton]] and [[Krista Polvere]]. He has written ''[[Infinity Blues]]'', a book of poems, and ''[[Hello Sunshine (book)|Hello Sunshine]]'', a collection of poems and short stories.

==Early life==
David Ryan Adams was born on November 5, 1974, in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]].<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ryan-adams-mn0000808336/biography|title=Ryan Adams Biography |first= Mark |last=Deming|access-date= February 14, 2019|website=[[AllMusic.com]]}}</ref> He is the middle of three children with an older brother and younger sister.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bobmehr/at-home-kinda-with-ryan-adams|title=Ryan Adams Finally Finds His Way Home|first=Bob |last=Mehr|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=September 7, 2014|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> His childhood has been described as "dysfunctional". His father left when he was five at which time he, his mother and his siblings had to move in with his grandparents since they became homeless as a result of the divorce. He has said in an interview, "I became who I am now because of my grandparents"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/22/ryan-adams-things-got-broken|title=Ryan Adams: 'Things got broken and I couldn't fix them'|first=Dave |last=Simpson|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 22, 2011|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and of his grandmother  "...she was like a mother to me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/so-alive-ryan-adams-interview|title=So Alive – Ryan Adams Interview|work=Clash Magazine|date=October 10, 2014|access-date=November 28, 2014}}</ref> His mother remarried when he was 13.

At the age of eight, Adams began writing short stories and limericks on his grandmother's typewriter. In his own words, "I started writing short stories when I was really into [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Then later, when I was a teenager, I got really hard into cult fiction: [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]]." At 14, Adams began learning to play an electric guitar his mother and stepfather had bought him and soon joined a local band named Blank Label. While they quickly disbanded, they did record a short three-track 7-inch record, in 1991.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heatley |first=Michael |author-link= Michael Heatley |title= Ryan Adams |year=2003 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London, England|isbn=0-7119-9435-8  |pages=14–15}}</ref>

Adams dropped out of [[Jacksonville High School (North Carolina)|Jacksonville High School]] in 10th grade, at the age of 16, subsequently moving into bandmate Jere McIlwean's rental house, just outside Jacksonville.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/ryan-adams/biography|title=Ryan Adams Biography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> Around this time, he played and performed with a number of local bands, most notably his and McIlwean's The Patty Duke Syndrome. After obtaining his [[General Educational Development|GED]], Adams left Jacksonville for [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], shortly followed by McIlwean. The Patty Duke Syndrome broke up in 1994<ref>{{cite book |last=Heatley |first=Michael |author-link= Michael Heatley |title= Ryan Adams |year=2003 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London, England|isbn=0-7119-9435-8  |pages=16–20}}</ref> after releasing a [[Split album|split 7-inch single]] with GlamourPuss.

== Career ==

===Whiskeytown===
{{Main|Whiskeytown}}

Following the breakup of his high school band, The Patty Duke Syndrome, Adams helped found [[Whiskeytown]] with [[Caitlin Cary]], Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, Steve Grothmann and [[Phil Wandscher]]. Whiskeytown saw Adams move to [[Alternative country|alt-country]], describing [[punk rock]] as "too hard to sing" in the title track of Whiskeytown's debut album ''[[Faithless Street]]''. Whiskeytown was heavily influenced by a number of country-rock pioneers, most notably [[Gram Parsons]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inman |first1=Davis |title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons |url=https://americansongwriter.com/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/?nab=1 |website=American Songwriter|date=May 18, 2012 }}</ref> The band quickly gained critical acclaim with the release of their second full-length album, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', their first [[Record label|major label]] release. A third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]],'' was completed in 1999, but record label problems delayed its release. It was eventually released by [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]] in 2001, at which time the band was effectively done.

===Solo career (2000–2004)===
Adams made his solo debut in 2000, with ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' (produced by [[Ethan Johns]]).<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712133705/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=112&csid2=4&fid1=26076 'Ryan Adams Grows Up']. An interview on Exclaim.ca</ref> [[Emmylou Harris]] sang backup on "Oh My Sweet Carolina."  Other backing vocals and instruments were provided by [[Gillian Welch]], [[David Rawlings]], [[Pat Sansone]], and Kim Richey as Adams embraced a style more reminiscent of folk music. It was met with considerable critical success, but sales were slow.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Greenhaus|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_ryan_adams_reflects_on_heartbreaker/|title=Interview: Ryan Adams Reflects on 'Heartbreaker'|website=Relix|date= July 6, 2016}}</ref>

Adams released ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', the follow-up to ''Heartbreaker'', in 2001. It was well received. Adams, however, initially refused to promote the record through radio station meet-and-greets and other music-industry conventions, instead opting for more recording and some live dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} A video was eventually made for the album's first single, "[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]". The music video featured Adams performing in front of the city's skyline four days before the [[September 11 attacks]]. The video was played often on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] after the attacks and became Adams's breakthrough to mainstream music consumers.

Following the success of ''Gold'', in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from releasing his choice for a follow-up album. This would be the second time, the first being with ''Gold;'' Adams had recorded "the Suicide Handbook" which was rejected on the grounds that it was "too sad". The label opted this time around to cherry pick (without Adams' involvement) from four of Adams' recorded albums it had already dismissed as unreleasable (48 Hours, The Suicide Handbook, The Pinkhearts and The Swedish Sessions) to create ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]],'' released in September 2002. Although the album garnered him more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as ''Gold''. The same year, Adams produced [[Jesse Malin]]'s first album, ''[[The Fine Art of Self Destruction]]'', and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group [[The Finger (band)|The Finger]] (under the pseudonyms, "Warren Peace" and "Irving Plaza" respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'', released on [[One Little Indian Records]] in 2003. He also starred in a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams's "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]".

In May 2002, Adams joined Elton John on ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202201350/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 2, 2004 | title=CMT Crossroads: Elton John and Ryan Adams | access-date=April 11, 2007 | publisher = [[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> which brings together country artists with musicians from other genres. During the show, John referred to Adams as "fabulous one" and spoke of how ''Heartbreaker'' inspired him to record ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]'', which at the time was his most successful album in several years. Also in 2002, Adams reportedly recorded a cover of [[The Strokes]]' debut album ''[[Is This It]]'', though it has never been publicly released.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/11149 | title=Adams Different Strokes in Demand! | access-date=April 11, 2007 | date=April 3, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>

In 2002 and 2003, Adams worked on recording ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', intending to release it in 2003. [[Lost Highway Records]] deemed that it was not commercially viable and was reluctant to release it, leading Adams to go back to the studio. Two weeks later he returned to Lost Highway with ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock n Roll]]'', which featured guest musicians including [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], [[Green Day]]'s [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], and Adams's girlfriend at the time, [[Parker Posey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=RJ |title=Ryan Adams, 'Rock N Roll' (Lost Highway) |url=https://www.spin.com/2003/11/ryan-adams-rock-n-roll-lost-highway/ |website=SPIN |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref>  Adams' songwriting received additional exposure when [[Joan Baez]] included his song "In My Time of Need", from his debut release, on her 2003 album ''[[Dark Chords on a Big Guitar]].''

Also released in 2003, Adams formed a punk band called The Finger with [[Jesse Malin]], Colin Burns, and Johnny T. Yerington.<sup>[[The Finger (band)#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] rock band Finger, of which Adams was a big fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists to return to their punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk band [[Heart Attack (band)|Heart Attack]] and more famously as the lead singer of [[D Generation]]). They began by releasing two EPs: ''We Are Fuck You'' and ''Punk's Dead Let's Fuck'' which were later collected to form the album ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'' that was released in 2003.

Adams and Lost Highway Records eventually agreed that the label would release ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' as well as ''Love Is Hell'', on the condition that ''Love Is Hell'' be split into two EP installments. ''Rock N Roll'' and ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 1'' were released in November 2003, followed by ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 2'' in December. Both albums were well received by critics, and in May 2004 ''Love Is Hell'' was re-released as a full-length album.

''Love Is Hell'' included a cover of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]", which Adams had previously performed live, and about which [[Noel Gallagher]] once said, "I never got my head round this song until I went to [see] Ryan Adams play and he did an amazing cover of it."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/12909 | title = The 'Wonder' of Ryan | access-date=April 11, 2007| date=October 31, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> The song earned Adams a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for "[[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance|Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |title=Kanye West is at top of Grammy list |access-date=August 15, 2012 |date=December 8, 2004 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629020925/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>

While on tour to support ''Love Is Hell'' in January 2004, Adams fractured his wrist during a performance at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in Liverpool. Adams fell off the end of the stage into the lowered orchestra pit six feet below, while performing "The Shadowlands". Dates from Adams's European and American tours had to be canceled as a result of his injury.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ryanadams/articles/story/5937118/ryan_adams_cancels_tour | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013081117/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ryanadams/articles/story/5937118/ryan_adams_cancels_tour | url-status = dead | archive-date = October 13, 2007 | title = Ryan Adams Cancels Tour | access-date = April 23, 2007 | date=January 30, 2004 | publisher = Rolling Stone/Wenner Publishing | last = Dansby | first = Andrew}}</ref>

Adams was featured on the album [[True Love (Toots & the Maytals album)|''True Love'']] by [[Toots and the Maytals]], which won the [[Grammy Award]] in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Trey Anastasio]], [[Gwen Stefani]] / [[No Doubt]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Manu Chao]], [[The Roots]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Toots Hibbert]], [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]], Jackie Jackson, [[Ken Boothe]], and [[The Skatalites]].<ref>"True Love – Linear CD Notes."

===The Cardinals (2005–2009)===
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2023}}
{{Main|Ryan Adams and the Cardinals}}
The year 2005 saw Adams join with backing band [[Ryan Adams and the Cardinals|the Cardinals]] to produce two albums, ''[[Cold Roses]]'' and ''[[Jacksonville City Nights]]''. ''Cold Roses'', a double album, included backing vocals from [[Rachael Yamagata]] on three songs; "Let It Ride", "Cold Roses" and "Friends".  His second album of the year, ''Jacksonville City Nights'', featured a duet with [[Norah Jones]] on "Dear John". As well as releasing two albums with The Cardinals, Adams released the solo album ''[[29 (album)|29]]'' late in the year.
[[File:The Cardinals08.jpg|thumb|left|Adams live with The Cardinals in November 2008]]
Adams befriended [[Phil Lesh]] of the [[Grateful Dead]], after first meeting him at the [[Jammys]] awards in New York in 2005. The two performed [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]'s Grateful Dead classic, "Wharf Rat". Adams performed at subsequent outings of [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], including a two-night stand at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] outside of [[Denver]], Colorado and on New Year's Eve 2005 at the Bill Graham Event Center in San Francisco. Throughout 2006, Lesh's live performances included compositions by Adams, including several from ''Cold Roses'' ("Cold Roses", "Let It Ride", and "Magnolia Mountain").

Adams produced [[Willie Nelson]]'s album ''[[Songbird (Willie Nelson album)|Songbird]]'', while he and The Cardinals performed as Nelson's backing band.  The album was released in October 2006.  He also opened for Nelson at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] later that fall, a show that featured [[Phil Lesh]] on bass and multiple [[Grateful Dead]] songs.  Late in 2006, Adams experimented with [[hip hop music]], adding to his web site 18 albums worth of new recordings under various pseudonyms, featuring humorous and nonsensical lyrics, as well as covers of two [[Bob Dylan]] songs ("[[Isis (song)|Isis]]" and "[[You're a Big Girl Now]]").

In May 2009, drummer [[Brad Pemberton]] stated that: "everyone was a bit fried, so it was the right time to step back for a minute. I encouraged Ryan to go and get married, and have a life and find some peace; the guy hasn't really slowed down in ten years, and he needed it as much as we did.

===Disputes with fans and other artists===
At a concert in October 2002, at Nashville's [[Ryman Auditorium]], someone in the audience yelled out a request for "[[Summer of '69]]", a song by the similarly named [[Bryan Adams]]. Adams reacted with a stream of expletives, and ordered the house lights turned on, ''[[The Tennessean]]'' newspaper reported. He eventually found the fan who made the joke-request, paid him $30 cash as a refund for the show, ordered him to leave, and said he would not play another note until he had left.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73812/ryan-adams-not-amused-by-name-game |title=Ryan Adams Not Amused by Name Game |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=September 19, 2015}}</ref> In a 2014 interview, Ryan Adams denied that the audience-member was asked to leave "for screaming a Bryan Adams song", but rather because the man was drunk: "The reason why the guy was asked to leave by me was because I was doing an a-capella three-piece with [[Gillian Welch]], [[David Rawlings]], and myself of '[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Bartering Lines]]', and in between the quiet parts the guy was screaming."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gabler|first=Jay|url=http://blog.thecurrent.org/2014/10/ryan-adams-clarifies-bryan-adams-stories-says-album-cover-similarity-is-coincidental/|title=Ryan Adams clarifies Bryan Adams stories, says album cover similarity is coincidental &#124; Local Current Blog &#124; The Current from Minnesota Public Radio|website=Blog.thecurrent.org|date=October 17, 2014|access-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/9145/rumors_about_ryan_adamss_dating_life_summer_of_69d/news/ |title=Rumors about Ryan Adams's Dating-Life, "Summer of '69"-Dude Ejection gave been greatly exaggerated |publisher=[[Stereogum]] |date=April 16, 2008 |access-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> In April 2015, Ryan, who had since become friends with Bryan, played "Summer of '69" at the end of another performance at the Ryman, an act described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as "an olive branch to the city that was once his home".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/watch-ryan-adams-redemptive-cover-of-summer-of-69-20150429|title=Watch Ryan Adams' Redemptive Cover of 'Summer of '69{{'-}}|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Leahey|first=Andrew|date=April 29, 2015|access-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

During filming of the BBC's long-running show ''Songwriter's Circle'', where Adams was joined by American folk-singer [[Janis Ian]] and New Zealand's [[Neil Finn]], it was reported that he refused to participate in a number of the songs performed on the night and was generally dismissive of collaborating with the others.

== Recognition ==
Adams is recognized for his highly prolific songwriting and a singing style that resembles that of a country rocker, even though he played [[punk rock]] in the early part of his career. Adams has frequently experimented with different genres, although for the major part of his career his musical style has been [[alternative rock]]. He is also one of the few artists to emerge from the alt-country scene into mainstream commercial success.<ref name="All cobain">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ryan-adams-mn0000808336/biography |title=Ryan Adams' biography and discography|publisher=All Music|first=Mark |last=Deming|access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
In 2004, Fairchild signed to [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Her first album, ''[[Ride (Shelly Fairchild album)|Ride]]'', was issued in early 2005. Its lead-off single, "You Don't Lie Here Anymore", co-written with Clay Mills, peaked at No.&nbsp;35 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, although subsequent singles failed to chart. She toured in support of the album including an opening spot on [[Rascal Flatts]]' sold-out ''Here's to You'' tour which also featured [[Blake Shelton]], but was dropped from Columbia by the end of the year.

In 2008, Fairchild signed a record deal with [[Stroudavarious Records]] which was founded by producer [[James Stroud]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/audio/shelly-fairchild-its-all-gonna-work-out|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106212430/http://www.roughstock.com/audio/shelly-fairchild-its-all-gonna-work-out|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2009|title=Shelly Fairchild — "It's All Gonna Work Out"|work=Roughstock|accessdate=January 5, 2009}}</ref> Her first release was the song "It's All Gonna Work Out", which she released for a charity album called ''We Are Enterprise''.

She co-wrote a song called "Love Everybody", which was an anchor for this record.<ref name="Shelly Fairchild — Sip Magazine">{{cite web|url=https://thesipmag.com/shelly-fairchild/|title=Shelly Fairchild |author=Lauchlin Fields |date=November 2, 2015|work=The 'Sip |accessdate=October 5, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, Fairchild was one of three background singers for [[Martina McBride]]'s "Everlasting Tour". Touring with McBride, Fairchild explained, was a huge highlight of her career.

Martina is somebody I’ve looked up to as a singer my whole life."<ref name="Shelly Fairchild — Sip Magazine"/>

'''Son Volt''' is an American rock band formed in 1994 by [[Jay Farrar]] after the breakup of [[Uncle Tupelo]]. The band's current line-up consists of Farrar (vocals, guitar), Andrew DuPlantis (bass guitar), John Horton (guitar), Mark Patterson (drums), and Mark Spencer (keyboard, steel guitar). In addition to playing [[alternative rock]], the band is considered a staple of the [[alternative country]] rock movement of the 1990s. The band's sound also is rooted in [[folk rock]] and Americana. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2001,<ref>{{Cite magazine |author= |date=2001-09-27 |title=Jay Farrar Spreads His Solo Wings |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/jay-farrar-spreads-his-solo-wings-78285/ |access-date=2023-03-03 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref> before reforming in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sculley |first=Alan |title=Son Volt returns -- in a sense |url=https://www.eu.heraldtribune.com/story/news/2006/01/27/son-volt-returns-in-a-sense/28458863007/ |access-date=2023-03-03 |website=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
=== Early Years, ''Trace'', ''Straightaways'', and ''Wide Swing Tremolo'' ===
The group formed after the [[Alternative country|alternative country rock]] act [[Uncle Tupelo]] broke up due to tensions between Farrar and bandmate [[Jeff Tweedy]]. After Uncle Tupelo split, Tweedy formed the alternative rock act [[Wilco]], while Farrar decided to form another act. While forming Son Volt, Farrar met Jim and Dave Boquist during the final Uncle Tupelo tour and teamed up with former Uncle Tupelo drummer Mike Heidorn to create the band. The group performed and recorded in the Minneapolis area in late 1994 and performed its first concert at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis on June 16, 1995. While half of the band was rooted in the Minneapolis area, Farrar and Heidorn lived in the St. Louis area, and the band used both cities as bases for its operations during the first couple of years.

Son Volt's first album, ''[[Trace (Son Volt album)|Trace]]'', met with critical acclaim and topped many "best-of" lists in 1995. It was a moderate commercial success; the first track "Windfall" became very popular in the alt-country scene, while the band released "Drown" as a single which charted #10 on the mainstream rock charts and #25 on the modern rock charts. By 2009, ''Trace'' had sold 297,000 copies in the United States.<ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine |last=Ayers |first=Michael D. |date=2009-08-13 |title=Death Cab's Ben Gibbard, Jay Farrar Team Up For Kerouac Soundtrack |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/death-cabs-ben-gibbard-jay-farrar-team-up-for-kerouac-soundtrack-267721/ |access-date=2023-03-02 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref>

1997's ''[[Straightaways]]'' followed in the same vein as ''Trace'' with even a more acoustic feel, leading some music critics to give negative reviews, but strong and positive reviews came from outlets such as the [[Orlando Sentinel]] and the [[Chicago Tribune]]. 1998's ''[[Wide Swing Tremolo]]'' featured a heavier rock sound and received mostly positive reviews from music outlets. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that "many of the songs ... return to the power and purity of the band’s brilliant 1995 debut, ''Trace''."

=== Hiatus and return ===
Farrar announced a hiatus from Son Volt after their 1999 tour. Beginning in 2001, Jay Farrar released several solo efforts that postponed further releases from Son Volt. Farrar reformed with the original members of Son Volt to record a song for a tribute album for [[Alejandro Escovedo]]. The sessions reportedly went so well that Farrar and the other band members intended to record once again in the autumn of 2004. Just prior to the sessions, however, Farrar and the other band members abruptly ended negotiations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jake Brown |url=http://gloriousnoise.com/2004/son_volt_reforms_and_returns_t |title=Son Volt Reforms and Returns to the Studio |date=22 September 2004 |publisher=Glorious Noise |access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref> Farrar formed a new version of the band with a different line-up and released an album on Transmit Sound/Sony Legacy, ''[[Okemah and the Melody of Riot]]'', a folk-rock album based on protest music that had been influenced by [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4817987 |title=Son Volt Is Back: 'Okemah and the Melody of Riot' : World Cafe | website=Npr.org |access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref> in 2005. That same year also saw the release of ''[[A Retrospective: 1995-2000]]'', which gathered highlights from this era, along with previously unreleased recordings. 2006 saw the release of a live DVD, ''Six String Belief'', which was recorded at The Orange Peel in [[Asheville, NC]].

=== Band reformed and new music ===
In 2007, the band returned to an alternative rock and alt-country sound and released a studio album called ''[[The Search (Son Volt album)|The Search]]''. The Americana- and folk-influenced album ''[[American Central Dust]]'' followed, released by Rounder Records on July 7, 2009. Their next project was a [[Bakersfield Sound]]-influenced album aptly named ''[[Honky Tonk (album)|Honky Tonk]]'', which was released March 5, 2013, also by Rounder Records. A large scale tour followed the release of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonvolt.net/ |title=Official Son Volt site |website=Sonvolt.net |access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref> On February 17, 2017, the band released ''[[Notes of Blue]]'' on Farrar's label, Transmit Sound.

=== ''Union'' and ''Electro Melodier'' ===
The band's ninth studio album, ''[[Union (Son Volt album)|Union]]'', was released on March 28, 2019 on Farrar's Transmit Sound label and distributed by Thirty Tigers Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/12/son-volt-to-release-9th-studio-album-union-on-329.html|title=Son Volt to Release 9th Studio Album, "Union" on 3/29|website=Music News Net}}</ref> The album consisted of songs that were highly critical of the election of US President [[Donald Trump]] and his administration. Many of the songs were commentaries on middle-class economics, freedom of the press, and immigration. Son Volt's tenth album, ''[[Electro Melodier]]'', was released on July 30, 2021. In early summer 2021, guitarist Chris Frame announced that he would be leaving the band to pursue other interests and was replaced by former [[Bottle Rockets]] guitarist John Horton. The tribute album ''[[Day of the Doug]]'' followed in 2023.

==Musical style==
Son Volt's music ranges from quiet [[folk music|folk]] ballads reminiscent of ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', to heartland rock in the spirit of [[Neil Young]] with [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]]. The band's sound features a heavy alternative rock sound in many places, all while basing their music in mostly an Americana style.<ref>Stewart, M (2017).[https://livemusicdaily.com/2017/04/13/alt-country-pioneers-son-volt-hit-stride-at-d-c-s-930-club/ "Alt-Country Pioneers Son Volt Hit Stride at D.C.’s 9:30 Club"]''Live Music Daily''</ref> Reviews refer to the band as [[alternative country]] pioneers, a "staple in the ALT-Country Scene" or "a cult favorite", with their music "spanning a few musical niches", but based in [[Americana (music)|Americana]].<ref>Remz, J.B (2019).

'''The Band''' was a Canadian-American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Toronto, Ontario]], in 1967. It consisted of Canadians [[Rick Danko]] (bass, guitar, vocals, fiddle), [[Garth Hudson]] (organ, keyboards, accordion, saxophone), [[Richard Manuel]] (piano, drums, vocals), [[Robbie Robertson]] (guitar, songwriting, vocals, piano, percussion), and American [[Levon Helm]] (drums, vocals, mandolin, guitar, bass). The Band combined elements of [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[Folk music|folk]], rock, [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], influencing musicians such as [[George Harrison]], [[Elton John]], [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Wilco]].

Between 1958 and 1963, the group was known as the Hawks, a backing band for [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. In the mid-1960s, they gained recognition for backing [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|the 1966 concert tour]] was notable as Dylan's first with an electric band. After leaving Dylan and changing their name to ''The Band'', they released several records to critical and popular acclaim, including their debut album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' in 1968. According to [[AllMusic]], the album's influence on several generations of musicians has been substantial: musician [[Roger Waters]] called ''Music from Big Pink'' the second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll,<ref>{{cite web|last=Moon|first=Tom|author-link=Tom Moon|date=June 1, 2018|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/01/624729592/50-years-on-the-bands-music-from-big-pink-haunts-us-still|title=50 Years On, The Band's 'Music From Big Pink' Haunts Us Still|publisher=[[NPR]]|language=en-US|access-date=December 10, 2020}}</ref> and music journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] called it "country soul ... a sound never heard before".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-beginnings-of-the-band-getting-started-meeting-bob-dylan-and-music-from-big-pink-91781/ |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105140956/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-beginnings-of-the-band-getting-started-meeting-bob-dylan-and-music-from-big-pink-91781/amp/ |archive-date=November 5, 2018 |title=The Beginnings of the Band: Getting Started, Meeting Bob Dylan and 'Music From Big Pink' |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date= August 24, 1968 |access-date=February 27, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Their most popular songs included "[[The Weight]]", "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]", and "[[Up on Cripple Creek]]".

The Band performed their farewell concert on November 25, 1976. Footage from the event was released in 1978 as the [[concert film]] ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', directed by [[Martin Scorsese]].  It would be the last performance of the original five members.  After five years apart, Danko, Hudson, Helm, and Manuel reunited in 1983 (without Robertson) for a reunion tour. Robertson had taken up a second career as a successful producer and composer for film soundtracks. Manuel died in 1986, but the remaining three members would continue to tour and occasionally release new albums of studio material until 1999, when, upon the death of Danko, the remaining members decided to break up for good. Helm would go on to a successful solo career, winning multiple [[Grammy Awards]] in the folk and Americana categories until his 2012 death, while Hudson found a second career as a featured session musician. Robertson died in 2023, leaving Hudson as the only living member of the original lineup.

Music critic Bruce Eder described The Band as "one of the most popular and influential rock groups in the world, their music embraced by critics ... as seriously as the music of [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Band: A Brief History |url=https://theband.hiof.no/history/band_shortstory.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030409083720/https://theband.hiof.no/history/band_shortstory.html |website=The Band |archive-date=April 9, 2003 }}{{void|Fabricakator|comment|replacing https://theartofsound.net/forum/showthread.php?51001-FONDLY-REMEMBERED-The-Band-Artist-Biography-by-Bruce-Eder&s=8b2f9e8c13afe8f24afc0b708a1b5d32}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The Band was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carasonline.ca/canadian-music-hall-of-fame/|title=Canadian Music Hall of Fame|website=Carasonline.ca|access-date=January 4, 2014|archive-date=August 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802075451/https://carasonline.ca/canadian-music-hall-of-fame/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-band/|title=The Band|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=January 4, 2014}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them 50th on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]],<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Williams | first=Lucinda | author-link=Lucinda Williams | title=The Immortals&nbsp;– The Greatest Artists of All Time: 50, The Band | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|issue=946 | date=April 15, 2004 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-band-20110420 | access-date=June 20, 2017}}</ref> and ranked "The Weight" 41st on its list of the [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 greatest songs of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416005906/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 16, 2007|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|magazine=RollingStone.com|access-date=June 2, 2007}}</ref> In 2008, the group received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826002047/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ |archive-date=2010-08-26 | title=Lifetime Achievement Award |website=Grammy.com | access-date=December 28, 2008}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In 2014, they were inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/|title=Canada's Walk of Fame|website=Canada's Walk of Fame|language=en-CA|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
===1957–1964: The Hawks===
{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2024}}
The members of The Band gradually came together in the Hawks, the backing group for [[Toronto]]-based [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. [[Levon Helm]] began playing with the group in 1957, then became their fulltime drummer after graduating from high school in 1958. Helm journeyed with Hawkins from [[Arkansas]] to Ontario, where they were joined by Robertson, Danko, Manuel, and finally Hudson. Latter-day Band member [[Stan Szelest]] was also in the group at that time. Hawkins's act was popular in and around Toronto and nearby Hamilton,<ref name=rock>Graham Rockingham. [http://www.thespec.com/news-story/6954409-branding-hamilton-as-a-music-city/ "Branding Hamilton as a music city"]. ''Hamilton Spectator'', November 9, 2016.</ref> and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition: when a promising band appeared, Hawkins would hire their best musicians for his own group; Robertson, Danko, and Manuel came under Hawkins's tutelage this way.

While most of the Hawks were eager to join Hawkins's group, getting Hudson to join was a different story. He had earned a college degree, planned on a career as a music teacher, and was interested in playing rock music only as a hobby. The Hawks admired his wild, full-bore organ style and asked him repeatedly to join. Hudson finally agreed, under the condition that the Hawks each pay him $10 per week to be their instructor and purchase a new state-of-the-art Lowrey organ; all music theory questions were directed to Hudson.

{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|There is a view that [[jazz]] is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd&nbsp;Street, and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.|—Garth Hudson in ''The Last Waltz''}}

With Hawkins, they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving Toronto music scene. Hawkins regularly convened all-night rehearsals following long club shows, with the result that the young musicians quickly developed great technical prowess on their instruments.

In late 1963, the group split from Hawkins over personal differences. They were tired of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material, and they were wary of Hawkins's heavy-handed leadership. He would fine the Hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs (fearing it might reduce the numbers of "available" girls who came to performances) or if they smoked [[marijuana]].

Robertson later said, "Eventually, [Hawkins] built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/back_to_the_land.html |title=Andy Gill: Back to the Land |website=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref>

Upon leaving Hawkins, the group was briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet, with sixth member sax player Jerry Penfound, and then as Levon and the Hawks after Penfound's departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name the Canadian Squires, but they returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for [[Atco Records|Atco]] later that year.<ref>Gray, 33, 37.</ref> Also in 1965, Helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]]. They wanted to record with him, offering to become his backing band, but Williamson died not long after their meeting.

Later in 1965, [[Bob Dylan]] hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|world tour in 1966]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Heylin | first = Clinton |author-link =Clinton Heylin| title = Behind the Shades Revisited | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | location = New York | pages = 223–260
 | isbn = 0-06-052569-X}}</ref> Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with help from Dylan and his manager, [[Albert Grossman]], to [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties, New York]], where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'', the basis for their 1968 debut album, ''[[Music from Big Pink]]''. Because they were always "the band" to various frontmen and the locals in Woodstock, Helm said the name ''The Band'' worked well when the group came into its own.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hoskyns |first = Barney |author-link =Barney Hoskyns |title = Across the Great Divide: The Band and America |url = https://archive.org/details/acrossgreatdivid00hosk |url-access = limited |publisher = Hyperion |year = 1993 |isbn = 1-56282-836-3 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/acrossgreatdivid00hosk/page/144 144]–145}}</ref>{{efn|According to [[Alan W.

===1965–1967: With Bob Dylan===
[[File:The Big Pink (crop).jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=|"Big Pink" in 2006]]

In late summer 1965, Bob Dylan was looking for a backup band for his first U.S. "electric" tour. Levon and the Hawks were recommended by blues singer [[John P. Hammond]], who earlier that year had recorded with Helm, Hudson and Robertson on his [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] album [[So Many Roads (John P. Hammond album)|''So Many Roads'']].<ref>Heylin, 173–174.</ref><ref>Gray, 292–293.</ref> Around the same time, one of their friends from Toronto, Mary Martin, was working as secretary to Dylan's manager, [[Albert Grossman]]. She told Dylan to visit the group at Le Coq d'Or Tavern, a club on [[Yonge Street]], in Toronto—though Robertson recollects it was the Friar's Tavern, just down the street.<ref name="MacDonald Part2 Clip 6">{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Bruce|title=Part 2 (1960–1965): Clip 6|url=http://watch.bravo.ca/yonge-street/yonge-street-toronto-rock--roll-stories/yonge-street---toronto-rock--roll-stories-part-2/#clip436570|work=Yonge Street: Toronto Rock & Roll Stories|publisher=Bravo Canada|access-date=May 14, 2011|location=Toronto|format=Video|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121033629/http://watch.bravo.ca/yonge-street/yonge-street-Toronto-rock--roll-stories/Yonge-street---Toronto-rock--roll-stories-part-2/#clip436570|archive-date=January 21, 2012}}</ref> Her advice to Dylan: "You ''gotta'' see these guys."<ref>Hoskyns, 85–86.</ref>

After hearing The Band play and meeting with Robertson, Dylan invited Helm and Robertson to join his backing band. After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates and told him that they would continue with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and [[rhythm and blues]] group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become.<ref>Hoskyns, 94–97.</ref>

With Dylan, the Hawks played a series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as "Bob Dylan and the Band".

During and between tours, Dylan and the Hawks attempted several recording sessions, but with less than satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable [[Single (music)|single]] ("[[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?]]"), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what was intended to be Dylan's next album, ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', resulted in "[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.<ref name="Heylin285-286">[[Clinton Heylin|Heylin, Clinton]].

In Nashville, Robertson's guitar was prominent on the ''Blonde on Blonde'' recordings, especially "[[Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat]]", but the other members of the Hawks did not attend the sessions.

During the European leg of their 1966 world tour, [[Mickey Jones]] replaced Sandy Konikoff on drums. Dylan and the Hawks played at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[Manchester]] on May 17, 1966. The gig became legendary when, near the end of Dylan's electric set, an audience member shouted "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" After a pause, Dylan replied, "I don't believe you. You're a liar!" He then turned to the Hawks and said, "Play it fucking loud!" With that, they launched into an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".<ref>Sounes, 213–215.</ref>

The Manchester performance was widely [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]ged (and mistakenly placed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]). In a 1971 review for ''[[Creem]]'', critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote, "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago.

On July 29, 1966, while on a break from touring, Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident that precipitated his retreat into semi-seclusion in [[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Sounes, 216–218.</ref> For a while, the Hawks returned to the bar and roadhouse touring circuit, sometimes backing other singers, including a brief stint with [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].

The next month (initially without Helm) they commenced recording a much-bootlegged and influential series of demos, initially at Dylan's house in Woodstock and later at Big Pink, which were released partially on LP as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975 and [[The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete|in full in 2014]]. A track-by-track review of the bootleg was detailed by [[Jann Wenner]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in which the band members were explicitly named and given the collective name "the Crackers".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dylans-basement-tape-should-be-released-19680622 |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227225330/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dylans-basement-tape-should-be-released-19680622 |archive-date=December 27, 2012 |title=Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released |author=[[Jann Wenner]] |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 22, 1968 |access-date=June 6, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> While Helm was not involved in the initial recording, he did perform in later sessions and in overdubs recorded in 1975 before the album's release.

===1968–1972: Initial success===
[[File:The Band in Hamburg, 1971.jpg|thumb|220px|left|alt=|L to R: Danko, Helm and Manuel on tour in Hamburg, Germany, in 1971]]
The sessions with Dylan ended in October 1967, with Helm having rejoined the group by that time, and the Hawks began writing their own songs at Big Pink. When they went into the recording studio, they still did not have a name for themselves. Stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name "The Band". In ''The Last Waltz'', Manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either "the [[Honky|Honkies]]" or "the [[White cracker|Crackers]]" (which they used when backing Dylan for a January 1968 concert tribute to [[Woody Guthrie]]), but these names were vetoed by their record label; Robertson suggests that during their time with Dylan everyone just referred to them as "the band" and the name stuck. Initially they disliked the moniker, but eventually they grew to like it, thinking it both humble and presumptuous. In 1969, ''Rolling Stone'' referred to them as "the band from Big Pink".<ref name=rs30>{{Cite news  | title = Big Pink Band To Tour U.S. | newspaper = [[Rolling Stone]]  | page = 9  | date = April 5, 1969 | issue = 30}}</ref>

Their debut album, ''Music from Big Pink'' (1968) was widely acclaimed. It included three songs written or co-written by Dylan ("[[This Wheel's on Fire]]", "[[Tears of Rage]]" and "[[I Shall Be Released]]") as well as "[[The Weight]]", which became one of their best-known songs after it was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]''. While a continuity ran through the music, the style varied from song to song.

[[File:The Band -2005710053-.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=|Hudson in 1971]]
In early 1969, after the success of ''Music from Big Pink'', The Band went on tour, starting with an appearance at [[Winterland Ballroom]]. They performed at the [[Woodstock Festival]] (their performance was not included in the famed ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' film because of legal complications), and later that year they performed with Dylan at the UK [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]] (several songs from which were subsequently included on Dylan's ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]'' album). That same year, they left for Los Angeles to record their follow-up, ''[[The Band (album)|The Band]]'' (1969). From their rustic appearance on the cover to the songs and arrangements within, the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day. Several other artists made similar stylistic moves about the same time, notably Dylan, on ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'', which was written during the ''Basement Tapes'' sessions, and [[the Byrds]], on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', which featured two ''Basement Tapes'' covers. ''The Band'' featured songs that evoked old-time rural America, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]" to the [[labor union|unionization]] of farm workers in "[[King Harvest (Has Surely Come)]]".

These first two records were produced by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]], who was practically a group member: he aided in [[orchestration|arrangements]] in addition to playing occasional piano and [[tuba]]. Simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive [[horn section]]s featured so effectively on the first two albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively using their limited technique.

''Rolling Stone'' lavished praise on The Band in this era, giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazine's history; [[Greil Marcus]]'s articles contributed to The Band's mystique. The Band was also featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (January 12, 1970), the first rock group after the Beatles, over two years earlier, to achieve this rare distinction.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Time Magazine Cover: The Band&nbsp;– Jan. 12, 1970&nbsp;– Rock&nbsp;– Singers&nbsp;– Music |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19700112,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206083539/http://www.time.com/time/covers/0%2C16641%2C19700112%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |magazine=Time |date=January 12, 1970 |access-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> [[David Attie]]'s unused photographs for this cover—among the very few studio portraits taken during the Band's prime—have only recently been discovered, and were featured in Daniel Roher's [[Robbie Robertson]] documentary ''[[Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band]]'', as well as having their own four-page spread in [[Harvey Kubernik]] and Ken Kubernik's “The Story of the Band: From ''Big Pink'' to ''The Last Waltz''” (Sterling Publishing, 2018).<ref>[[Harvey Kubernik|Kubernik, Harvey]] & Kenneth, The Story of The Band, 2018, Sterling: p122-125.</ref>

A critical and commercial triumph, ''The Band'', along with works by the Byrds and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], established a musical template (dubbed [[country rock]]) that paved the way to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Both ''Big Pink'' and ''The Band'' also influenced their musical contemporaries. [[Eric Clapton]] and [[George Harrison]] cited The Band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clapton later revealed that he wanted to join the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/eric_clapton/reviews/8542|title=Eric Clapton&nbsp;– Derek and The Dominos&nbsp;– ''Layla & Other Assorted...''|website=Uncut.co.uk|access-date=January 21, 2009|archive-date=November 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126022720/http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/eric_clapton/reviews/8542|url-status=dead}}</ref> While he never did join, he recruited all of the members of The Band as well as other roots rock performers for his 1976 album ''[[No Reason to Cry]]''.

Following their second album, The Band embarked on their first tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer [[Todd Rundgren]] and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock. As with their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited with most of the songwriting. Initial critical reaction was positive, but it was seen as a letdown from the previous two albums for various reasons. After recording ''Stage Fright'', The Band was among the acts participating in the [[Festival Express]], an all-star rock concert tour of Canada by train that also included [[Janis Joplin]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and future Band member [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]] (at the time he was a member of Joplin's band). In the concert documentary film, released in 2003, Danko can be seen participating in a drunken jam session with [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]], [[John Dawson (musician)|John Dawson]], and Joplin while singing "Ain't No More Cane".

At about this time, Robertson began exerting greater control over The Band, a point of contention between him and Helm. Helm charges Robertson with [[authoritarianism]] and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because Danko, Helm, and Manuel were becoming more unreliable due to their heroin usage.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Crouch | first=Ian | date=December 8, 2016 | title=Robbie Robertson Offers His Story of The Band | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/robbie-robertson-offers-his-story-of-the-band | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810032117/https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/robbie-robertson-offers-his-story-of-the-band | archive-date=2017-08-10 | url-access=subscription | access-date=February 17, 2023}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Robertson insists he did his best to coax Manuel into writing more songs, only to see him descend into addiction.

Despite mounting problems among the group members, The Band forged ahead with their next album, ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]'' (1971). ''Cahoots'' featured Dylan's "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]", "4% Pantomime" (with [[Van Morrison]]), and "[[Life Is a Carnival]]", the last featuring a horn arrangement by [[Allen Toussaint]]. Toussaint's contribution was a critical addition to The Band's next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: "[[Holy Cow (Lee Dorsey song)|Holy Cow]]" on ''[[Moondog Matinee]]'' and "You See Me" on ''[[Jubilation (The Band album)|Jubilation]]''. In late December 1971, The Band recorded the live album ''[[Rock of Ages (The Band album)|Rock of Ages]]'', which was released in the summer of 1972. On ''Rock of Ages'', they were bolstered by the addition of a horn section, with arrangements written by Toussaint. Dylan appeared on stage on [[New Year's Eve]] and performed four songs with the group, including a version of "When I Paint My Masterpiece".

===1973–1975: Move to Shangri-La===
[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Bob Dylan and the Band in Chicago, 1974: (left to right) Danko, Robertson, Dylan and Helm]]

In 1973, The Band released the [[covers album]] ''[[Moondog Matinee]]''. There was no tour in support of the album, which garnered mixed reviews. However, on July 28, 1973, they played at the legendary [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen]], a massive concert that took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside [[Watkins Glen, New York]]. The event, which was attended by over 600,000 fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. It was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan, who had moved to [[Malibu, California]],<ref name=Marty>{{cite book| last =Newman| first =Martin Alan| title =Bob Dylan's Malibu| publisher =EDLIS Café Press| year =2021| location =Hibbing, Minnesota| isbn =9781736972304}}</ref> along with Robertson. By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the first order of business was backing Dylan on his album ''[[Planet Waves]]''. The album was released concurrently with their joint 1974 tour, in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the tour was documented on the live album ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before the Flood]]'',.

During this time, The Band brought in ''Planet Waves'' producer [[Rob Fraboni]] to help design a music studio for the group. By 1975, the studio, [[Shangri-La (recording studio)|Shangri-La]], was completed. That year, The Band recorded and released ''[[Northern Lights – Southern Cross]]'', their first album of all-new material since 1971. All eight songs were written exclusively by Robertson. Despite comparatively poor record sales, the album is favored by critics and fans. Levon Helm regards this album highly in his book, ''[[This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band|This Wheel's on Fire]]'': "It was the best album we had done since ''The Band''." The album also produced more experimentation from Hudson, switching to synthesizers, showcased on "Jupiter Hollow".

===1976–1978: ''The Last Waltz''===
{{main article|The Last Waltz}}

By the mid-1970s, Robbie Robertson was weary of touring. After ''Northern Lights&nbsp;– Southern Cross'' failed to meet commercial expectations, much of the group's 1976 tour was confined to theaters and smaller arenas in secondary markets (including the [[Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium]], the [[Long Island Arena]] and the Champlain Valley Expo in [[Essex Junction, Vermont]]), culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant [[ZZ Top]] at the [[Nashville Fairgrounds]] in September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theband.hiof.no/history/The_Band_in_Concert_1976.pdf |title=The Band In Concert, 1976 |date=November 2018 |website=theband.hiof.no}}</ref> In early September, Richard Manuel suffered a severe neck injury in a boating accident in Texas,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-band-drifting-toward-the-last-waltz-19761216?page=2 |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728071138/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-band-drifting-toward-the-last-waltz-242332/ |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |title=The Band: Drifting Toward the Last Waltz |author=Patrick Snyder |website=Rollingstone.com |date=December 16, 1976 |access-date=October 29, 2015 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> prompting Robertson to urge The Band to retire from live performances after staging a massive "farewell concert" known as ''[[The Last Waltz]]''. Following an October 30 appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the event, including [[turkey dinner]] for the audience of 5,000, was held on November 25 ([[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]) of 1976 at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]],<ref name = "Page 17">[[David Fricke|Fricke, David]], November 2001. ''The Last Waltz'' liner notes, 2002 CD re-issue, p.&nbsp;17.</ref> and featured a horn section with arrangements by Allen Toussaint and an allstar lineup of guests, including Canadian artists [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Neil Young]]. Two of the guests were fundamental to The Band's existence and growth: Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan. Other guests they admired (and in most cases had worked with before) included [[Muddy Waters]], [[Dr. John]], Van Morrison, [[Ringo Starr]], Eric Clapton, [[Ron Wood]], [[Bobby Charles]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Paul Butterfield]]. The concert was filmed by Robertson's friend, filmmaker [[Martin Scorsese]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/why-the-bands-the-last-waltz-is-the-greatest-concert-movie-of-all-time-104637/ |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129130745/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/why-the-bands-the-last-waltz-is-the-greatest-concert-movie-of-all-time-104637/ |archive-date=November 29, 2018 |title=Why The Band's 'The Last Waltz' Is the Best Concert Movie of All Time |last1=Fear |first1=David |date=November 25, 2016 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |language=en-US |access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

In 1977, The Band released their seventh studio album ''[[Islands (The Band album)|Islands]]'', which fulfilled their record contract with Capitol so that a planned ''Last Waltz'' film and album could be released on the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] label. ''Islands'' contained a mix of originals and covers, and was the last with The Band's original lineup. That same year, the group recorded soundstage performances with country singer [[Emmylou Harris]] ("Evangeline") and gospel-soul group [[the Staple Singers]] ("The Weight"); Scorsese combined these new performances—as well as interviews he had conducted with the group—with the 1976 concert footage. The resulting [[concert film]]–[[documentary film|documentary]] was released in 1978, along with a [[The Last Waltz (1978 album)|three-LP soundtrack]].

Helm later wrote about ''The Last Waltz'' in his autobiography, ''This Wheel's on Fire'', in which he made the case that it had been primarily Robbie Robertson's project and that Robertson had forced The Band's breakup on the rest of the group.<ref>Levon Helm and Stephen Davis. ''This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band'', Chapter Nine: ''The Last Waltz''</ref> Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: "I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it—and if this is only my statement, not theirs, I'll accept that. They're saying, 'Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.' Well, fine. I'll take the best music film that's ever been made, and make it my statement. I don't have any problems with that. None at all."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/where_have_you_gone_bo_diddly_rr.html|title=Edward Kiersh: Robbie Robertson of The Band|website=Theband.hiof.no|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>

The original quintet would perform together one last time: on March&nbsp;1, 1978 after the late set of a Rick Danko solo show at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy]], the group performed "Stage Fright", "The Shape I'm In", and "The Weight" for an encore.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://glidemagazine.com/77724/grousing-the-aisles-the-bands-real-last-performance/ |title=Grousing the Aisles: The Band's "Real" Last Performance |work=Glie Magazine |last=Bernstein |first=Scott |date=February 22, 2012 |access-date=July 3, 2021 }}</ref> Although the members of the group intended to continue working on studio projects, they drifted apart after the release of ''Islands'' in March 1977.

===1983–1989: Reformation and the death of Richard Manuel===
The Band resumed touring in 1983 without Robertson. Accomplished musician from Woodstock, NY, Jim Weider became lead guitarist. Robertson had found success with a solo career and as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] music producer. As a result of their diminished popularity, they performed in theaters and clubs as headliners and took support slots in larger venues for onetime peers such as the Grateful Dead and [[Crosby, Stills and Nash]].

After a performance in [[Winter Park, Florida]], on March 4, 1986, Manuel [[suicide|hanged himself]], aged 42, in his motel room.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|author-link=Jon Pareles|title=Richard Manuel, 40, Rock Singer and Pianist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/06/obituaries/richard-manuel-40-rock-singer-and-pianist.html|access-date=April 26, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 6, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|title=A Haunting Suicide Silences the Sweet, Soulful Voice of The Band's Richard Manuel|journal=People|date=March 24, 1986|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093224,00.html|access-date=April 26, 2014}}</ref> He had suffered for many years from alcoholism and drug addiction and had been clean and sober for several years beginning in 1978 but had begun drinking and using drugs again by 1984.<ref>Hoskyns, 365, 376–377, 384. Helm and Davis, 289, 294.</ref> Manuel's position as pianist was filled by old friend Stan Szelest (who died not long after) and then by Richard Bell. Bell had played with Ronnie Hawkins after the departure of the original Hawks, and was best known from his days as a member of Janis Joplin's [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].

The Band was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] at the [[Juno Awards of 1989|1989 Juno Awards]], where Robertson was reunited with original members Danko and Hudson. With Canadian country rock superstars [[Blue Rodeo]] as a back-up band, ''[[Music Express]]'' called the 1989 Juno appearance a symbolic "passing of the torch" from The Band to Blue Rodeo.

===1990–1999: Return to final recording and the death of Rick Danko===
In 1990, Capitol Records began to re-release the records from the 1970s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Bauldie |first=John |author-link=John Bauldie |date=5 March 1991 |title=Reviews of the Stage Fright, Moondog Matinee, Northern Lights - Southern Cross and Islands re-issues. |journal=Q Magazine |volume=84 |pages=10}}</ref> The remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a succession of musicians filling Manuel's and Robertson's roles. The Band appeared at [[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration|Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert]] in New York City in October 1992, where they performed their version of Dylan's "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]". In 1993, the group released their eighth studio album, ''[[Jericho (The Band album)|Jericho]]''. Without Robbie Robertson as primary lyricist, much of the [[songwriting]] for the album came from outside of the group. Also that year, The Band, along with Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, and other performers, appeared at U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1993 "Blue Jean Bash" inauguration party.<ref>Gray, Michael. ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'' (Levon Helm entry), {{ISBN|0826429742}}</ref>

In 1994, The Band performed at [[Woodstock '94]]. Later that year Robertson appeared with Danko and Hudson as the Band for the second time since the original group broke up. The occasion was the induction of The Band into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Helm, who had been at odds with Robertson for years over accusations of stolen songwriting credits, did not attend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-band |title=Induction into Rock HoF |website=Rockhall.com |access-date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> In February 1996, The Band with [[the Crickets]] recorded "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]", released on the [[tribute album]] ''[[Not Fade Away (Remembering Buddy Holly)]]''. The Band released two more albums after ''Jericho'': ''[[High on the Hog (The Band album)|High on the Hog]]'' (1996) and ''[[Jubilation (The Band album)|Jubilation]]'' (1998), the latter of which included guest appearances by Eric Clapton and [[John Hiatt]]. Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years but he eventually regained the use of his voice.

In 1998, the group revealed they were working on a follow-up album to ''Jubilation'' that has not been released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inthestudio.com/sessions/theband/transcript1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010109061900/http://www.inthestudio.com/sessions/theband/transcript1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2001-01-09|title=. . .

The final song the group recorded together was their 1999 version of Bob Dylan's "[[One Too Many Mornings]]", which they contributed to the Dylan tribute album ''[[Tangled Up in Blues]]''. On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at the age of 55. Following his death, The Band broke up for good. The final configuration of the group included Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar).

=== 2000–present ===
In 2002, Robertson bought all other former members' financial interests in the group (with the exception of Helm's),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/04/04/DD64672.DTL&type=music&ao=2 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joel | last=Selvin | author-link=Joel Selvin | title=The day the music lived / Rereleased 'Last Waltz' documents amazing night in 1976 when rock's royalty bid farewell to The Band&nbsp;– Page 2 of 2 | date=January 8, 2011}}</ref> giving him major control of the presentation of the group's material, including latter-day compilations.

====Members' other endeavours====
In 1977, Rick Danko released his [[eponym]]ous [[Rick Danko (album)|debut solo album]], which featured the other four members of The Band on various tracks. In 1984, Danko joined members of the [[Byrds]], the Flying Burrito Brothers, and others in the huge touring company that made up "The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration". Several members of the tour performed solo songs to start the show, including Danko, who performed "Mystery Train". Danko also released two collaboraive albums with [[Eric Andersen]] and [[Jonas Fjeld]], along with some live and compilation albums in the 1990s and 2000s; many of the latter records were produced by Aaron L. Hurwitz and are on the Breeze Hill/Woodstock Records Label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodstockrecords.com|title=Woodstock Records|website=Woodstockrecords.com}}</ref>

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Helm released several solo albums and toured with a band called Levon Helm and the RCO Allstars. He also began an acting career with his role as [[Loretta Lynn]]'s father in ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]''. Helm received praise for his narration and supporting role opposite [[Sam Shepard]] in 1983's ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''. In 1997, a CD by Levon Helm and the Crowmatix, ''Souvenir'', was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/souvenir_crowmatix.html|title=Levon Helm & The Crowmatix: Souvenir|website=Theband.hiof.no|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref> Beginning sometime in the 1990s, Helm regularly performed Midnight Ramble concerts at his home and studio in Woodstock, New York, and toured.<ref>{{cite web | author = Dawn LoBue | year = 2006 | url = http://levonhelm.com/biography.htm | title = Levon Helm Biography | publisher = LevonHelm.com | access-date = December 12, 2011 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111202075719/http://levonhelm.com/biography.htm | archive-date = December 2, 2011 }}</ref> In 2007 Helm released a new album, an homage to his southern roots called ''[[Dirt Farmer]]'', which was awarded a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] on February 9, 2008. ''[[Electric Dirt]]'' followed in 2009 and won the inaugural [[Grammy Award for Best Americana Album]]. His 2011 live album ''[[Ramble at the Ryman]]'' won in the same category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees?year=2011&genre=59|title=Best Americana Album|website=Grammy.com|access-date=December 9, 2011}}</ref>

After he left The Band, Robbie Robertson became a [[music producer]] and wrote film soundtracks (including acting as music supervisor for several of Scorsese's films) before beginning a solo career with his [[Daniel Lanois]]-produced [[Robbie Robertson (album)|eponymous album]] in 1987. Robertson continued mostly scoring films until his death in 2023.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greiving |first1=Tim |title=Robbie Robertson was on the verge of his greatest success with Martin Scorsese |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-08-10/robbie-robertson-martin-scorsese-killers-of-the-flower-moon-appreciation |access-date=11 August 2023 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=10 August 2023}}</ref>

Hudson has released two solo CDs, ''The Sea to the North'' in 2001, produced by Aaron (Professor Louie) Hurwitz, and ''Live at the Wolf'' in 2005, both featuring his wife, Maud, on vocals. He has also kept busy as an in-demand studio musician. He is featured extensively on recordings of the [[The Call (band)|Call]] and country-indie star Neko Case. Hudson contributed an original electronic score to an [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Dragon Slayers'', written by [[Stanley Keyes]] and directed by [[Brad Mays]] in 1986 at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in New York, which was restaged with a new cast in Los Angeles in 1990. In 2010, Hudson released ''Garth Hudson Presents: A Canadian Celebration of The Band'', featuring Canadian artists covering songs that were recorded by The Band.

In 2012, [[Jim Weider]] launched [[The Weight Band]], performing covers of The Band's music, alongside former members of the [[Levon Helm]] Band and [[Rick Danko]] Group. The Weight Band performed in a nationally broadcast [[PBS]] special, Infinity Hall Live,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ihlive.org/artists/the-weight-band/|title=The Weight Band · Infinity Hall Live|website=Ihlive.org}}</ref> featuring new music. Following the show, the band announced a self-titled album of new music. The Weight Band also hosts Camp Cripple Creek, which celebrates the legacy of the Woodstock Sound. Past guests have included [[Jackie Greene]], ''Music from Big Pink'' producer John Simon and [[John Sebastian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2016/01/26/the-weight-to-host-camp-cripple-creek|title=The Weight to Host Camp Cripple Creek|website=Jambands.com|date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

Manuel had few projects outside The Band; he and the rest of The Band contributed to Eric Clapton's 1976 album ''No Reason to Cry''. It included an original composition by Manuel and featured his vocals and drumming on several tracks. Manuel later worked on several film scores with Hudson and Robertson, including ''[[Raging Bull]]'' and ''[[The Color of Money]]''. ''[[Whispering Pines: Live at the Getaway]]'' was released in 2002.

==Musical style==
[[File:The Band - 2005710051.jpg|thumb|right|The Band in Hamburg, 1971: (left to right) Manuel, Danko, Robertson, and Helm]]
The Band's music fused many elements: primarily old [[country music]] and early [[rock and roll]], though the [[rhythm section]] often was reminiscent of [[Stax Records|Stax]]- or [[Motown]]-style rhythm and blues, and Robertson cites [[Curtis Mayfield]] and the [[Staple Singers]] as major influences, resulting in a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of many [[musical genre]]s. Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band: Helm's [[Southern American English|Southern]] accent was prevalent in his raw and powerful vocals, Danko sang tenor with a distinctively choppy enunciation, and Manuel alternated between falsetto and a soulful baritone. The singers regularly blended in [[Vocal harmony|harmonies]]. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as The Band's "lead" singer.<ref>''Classic albums: The Band'' documentary, 1997.</ref>

Every member was a multi-instrumentalist. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of [[timbre]]s from his [[Lowrey organ]]. Helm's drumming was often praised: critic Jon Carroll declared that Helm was "the only drummer who can make you cry," while prolific session drummer [[Jim Keltner]] admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques.<ref>Hoskyns, 189.</ref> Producer John Simon is often cited as a "sixth member" of The Band for producing and playing on ''Music from Big Pink'', co-producing and playing on ''The Band'', and playing on other songs up through The Band's 1993 reunion album ''Jericho''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEA7MuMoLqcC&q=john+simon+sixth+member+of+the+band&pg=PA239 |title=Barney Hoskyns&nbsp;– ''Across the Great Divide: The Band and America'' |isbn=9781423414421 |access-date=October 18, 2011|last=Hoskyns |first=Barney |author-link=Barney Hoskyns |year=2006 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation }}</ref>

==Copyright controversy==
Robertson is credited as writer or co-writer of the majority of The Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, ''This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band'', Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that the Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: "I think Levon's book hits the nail on the head about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band&nbsp;... I'm truly friends with everybody but, hey—it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble."<ref>[[Bill Flanagan|Flanagan, Bill]].

The album ''Music from Big Pink'', in particular, is credited with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 he had heard the album, "and it changed my life."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/levons_next_waltz_rs.html |title=Scott Spencer: Levon's Next Waltz |website=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315164633/http://theband.hiof.no/articles/levons_next_waltz_rs.html |archive-date=March 15, 2012}}</ref> The band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] took their name from a line in "The Weight". Guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] has acknowledged the album's influence on [[Fairport Convention]]'s ''[[Liege and Lief]]'', and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of the Beatles' back-to-basics album ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'' as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = Harris | first = John | title = There was a manic feeling in the air | newspaper = The Guardian | date = August 3, 2007 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/03/folk | access-date = December 28, 2008 | location=London}}</ref>{{efn|The recording sessions for ''Beggars Banquet'', however, wrapped up in the same month that ''Music from Big Pink'' was released.}} George Harrison said that his song "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]" was heavily influenced by The Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80788/george-harrison-all-things-in-good-time|title=George Harrison: 'All Things' in Good Time|access-date=July 16, 2013|work=Billboard.com}}</ref> Meanwhile, the ''Music from Big Pink'' song "The Weight" has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, "We certainly didn't want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and record four sides, four [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll."<ref>Gladstone, Howard.

In the 1990s, a new generation of bands influenced by The Band began to gain popularity, including [[Counting Crows]], [[the Wallflowers]], and [[the Black Crowes]]. Counting Crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late [[Richard Manuel]], "[[If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)]]", from their album ''[[Hard Candy (Counting Crows album)|Hard Candy]]''. The [[Black Crowes]] frequently cover songs by The Band during live performances, such as "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", which appears on their DVD/CD ''[[Freak 'n' Roll into the Fog]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496245/soundtrack |title=Soundtracks for the Black Crowes: Freak 'n' Roll... into the Fog |access-date=December 6, 2009 |work=The Internet Movie Database }}</ref> They have also recorded at Helm's studio in Woodstock.

The inspiration for the classic rock-influenced band [[The Hold Steady]] came while members Craig Finn and Tad Kubler were watching ''The Last Waltz''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://dailycollegian.com/2007/01/24/hold-steady-returns-hope-to-rocknroll/ | last=Master | first=Dave | title=Hold Steady returns hope to rock'n'roll: Daily Collegian exclusive interview with Craig Finn | newspaper=The Daily Collegian}}</ref> Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson are name-checked in the lyrics of "The Swish" from the Hold Steady's 2004 debut album ''[[Almost Killed Me]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cloakanddaggermedia.com/features/craig_finn/features2.html | title=Feature: Craig Finn | publisher=Cloak & Dagger Media | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706133648/http://www.cloakanddaggermedia.com/features/craig_finn/features2.html | archive-date=July 6, 2008}}</ref> Also that year, [[southern rock]]-revivalists [[Drive-By Truckers]] released the [[Jason Isbell]] penned track "Danko/Manuel" on the album ''[[The Dirty South (album)|The Dirty South]]''.

The Band also inspired Grace Potter, of [[Grace Potter and the Nocturnals]], to form the band in 2002. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Potter said, "The Band blew my mind. I thought if this is what Matt [Burr] meant when he said 'Let's start a rock 'n' roll band,' ... that was the kind of rock 'n' roll band I could believe in."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/Grace+Potter+Ghostbusters+rock+roll+wearing+pants/7915344/story.html |last=Perusse |first=Bernard |title=Grace Potter on Ghostbusters, rock 'n' roll and not wearing pants |newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130405231400/http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/Grace+Potter+Ghostbusters+rock+roll+wearing+pants/7915344/story.html |archive-date=April 5, 2013}}</ref>

'''Todd Daniel Snider''' (born October 11, 1966) <ref>{{cite book |last= Larkin |first= Colin |date= 2009 |title= Encyclopedia of Popular Music |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313734.001.0001/acref-9780195313734-e-73223?rskey=3jwPcM&result=24917 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780199726363}}</ref> is an American singer-songwriter whose music incorporates elements of folk, rock, blues, alt country, and funk.

==Early career==
Snider was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], but was raised in nearby [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], where he lived until he graduated from [[Beaverton High School]] in 1985. After high school, he moved to [[Santa Rosa, California]], to attend [[Santa Rosa Junior College]]. He only lasted one semester, but while there, he learned to play the harmonica.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Shapiro | first = Michael | title = Todd Snider recalls his Santa Rosa days | newspaper = [[The Press Democrat]] | date = September 21, 2014 | url = https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/entertainment/todd-snider-recalls-his-santa-rosa-days/ |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

With help from his brother Mike who bought him a plane ticket, Snider relocated to [[San Marcos, Texas]], after leaving SRJC in late fall of 1985.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn't Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 78–79 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref> Not long after he arrived in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], Snider saw [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] perform solo at [[Gruene Hall]], a legendary dance hall in [[New Braunfels, Texas]].<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> When he saw Walker that night, he decided he wanted to become a songwriter and began writing songs the next day.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy |date= April 14, 2012 |title= It All Started One Night in the '80s at Gruene Hall |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/us/todd-snider-records-a-tribute-to-jerry-jeff-walker.html |newspaper= The New York Times |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> He told ''Lone Star Music Magazine'' in 2004, "I didn't even know how to really play guitar yet, but I saw his show and went and got one."<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider met [[Kent Finlay]] at his very first writer's night, which was at Finlay's San Marcos club, [[Cheatham Street Warehouse]]. Finlay, who was a songwriter in his own right, became an important mentor and introduced Snider to the songs of [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Guy Clark]], [[John Prine]], and [[Shel Silverstein]], among others.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider soon was packing small rooms in San Marcos and over the next few years began to draw enthusiastic crowds in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], as well.<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y'Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

Snider also discovered [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] songwriter [[Keith Sykes (musician)|Keith Sykes]] while living in San Marcos when a friend at the local record store turned him on to a pair of albums Sykes made in the early ’70s.<ref>{{cite news |last= Boehm |first= Mike |date= July 29, 1995 |title= Country's Todd Snider: The Man of Still : Pop: The genre has changed over the years, but the artist remains true to traditional styles, as his 'Songs for the Daily Planet' shows |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-29-ca-29116-story.html |newspaper= Los AngelesTimes |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> In 1989, Snider's father moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and happened to meet Sykes’ sister-in-law. Through that connection, Snider sent Sykes a demo tape of some of his songs. Sykes thought one of the songs had potential, so Snider moved to Memphis to try to work with Sykes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Snider |first=Todd |title=I Never Met A Story I Didn't Like: Mostly True Tall Tales |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2014 |pages = 86–87 |isbn=978-0306822605}}</ref>

Not long after he arrived in Memphis, Snider landed a weekly residency at a local club The Daily Planet. He not only was soon packing the room, the audience knew the words to the songs and would sing along.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 267 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref>

Through Sykes, Snider met [[John Prine]] in 1991 while assisting on pre-production work Prine was doing with Sykes in Memphis for his album ''[[The Missing Years (album)|The Missing Years]]''. It was the beginning of a friendship that would last until Prine's death in 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Bernstein |first= Jonathan |date= April 8, 2020 |title= Todd Snider on John Prine: 'I Couldn't Believe I Knew Him'|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/todd-snider-remembers-john-prine-980532/ |magazine= Rolling Stone |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

In 1992, Sykes helped Snider land a development deal with [[Capitol Records]]. He recorded a number of sides in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] for the label,<ref>{{cite news |last= Langer |first= Andy|date= August 30, 1996 |title= The Real Y'Alternative: Todd Snider, Too Rock for Country, Too Country for Rock |url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/1996-08-30/532474/ |newspaper= The Austin Chronicle |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref> but they declined to pick up his option for a full album.<ref>{{cite book |last= Leaver |first= Jack |date= 1997 |title= All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings |chapter= ToddSnider |publisher= Backbeat |page= 432 |isbn= 9780879304751}}</ref>

Around the time of the Capitol deal, Snider began performing with a small band backing him which he dubbed the Bootleggers.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The band's lineup fluctuated some over the first year or so, but by the end of 1994, the lineup was set with [[Will Kimbrough]] on guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, and Joe McLeary on drums. Snider also had changed the band's name to the Nervous Wrecks.

Sykes was a one-time member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]’s [[Coral Reefer Band]] and Buffett had recorded a few of his songs, so when the Capitol deal fell through, he reached out on Snider's behalf to Buffett's label, Margaritaville Records, which was distributed by [[MCA Records|MCA]]. Not long after label exec Bob Mercer saw Snider perform at an industry showcase in Memphis in April 1993, Snider flew to California to open a show for Buffett. After seeing his set, Buffett offered Snider a deal with Margaritaville.<ref>{{cite book |last= White |first= Ryan |title= Jimmy Buffett: A Good Life All the Way |publisher= Atria Books |year=2014 |page= 268 |isbn= 9781501132568}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last= Clark |first= Rick |date= May 15, 1993 |title= Crossroads Less Traveled By Major Reps: But Memphis Meet Attracts Regional Acts, Reps |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

==Recordings==
===1990s===
====Margaritaville/MCA years====
Snider's debut album for Margaritaville, ''[[Songs for the Daily Planet]]'', was released in 1994 and reached number 23 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= February 4, 1995 |title= Heatseekers Albums |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-02-04-Billboard-Page-0026.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 26 |access-date= July 26, 2011}}</ref> Produced by [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Mike Utley]], the album was literally composed of songs he was playing at the Daily Planet nightclub in Memphis. Although there were a few guest musicians and singers on the record, the core lineup was Snider on acoustic guitar, Joe Mariencheck on bass, Joe McLeary on drums, Utley on keys, Eddie Shaver on electric guitar, and Peter Hyrka on mandolin, acoustic guitar, and violin.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Songs-For-The-Daily-Planet/release/1906404 |title= Todd Snider – Songs for the Daily Planet |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The record included a hidden track, "Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues," which became a minor radio hit, reaching No. 31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Album Rock Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= January 7, 1995 |title= AlbumRock Tracks |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-01-07-Billboard-Page-0097.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 103 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> A talking blues for Gen-X, the song mocked the early ’90s grunge scene and featured a band that refused to play. The video for another single from the album, "Alright Guy," was in rotation on VH1.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= March 25, 1995 |title= Video Monitor |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1995/1995-03-25-Billboard-Page-0041.pdf#search=%22alright%20guy%22 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 43 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's second album for Margaritaville/MCA, ''Step Right Up'', was released on April 23, 1996, and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' proclaimed it "more stunning than his debut."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Borzillo |first= Carrie|date= May 4, 1996 |title= Stepping Up |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9gsEAAAAMBAJ&dq=todd+snider+%22step+right+up%22&pg=PA20|magazine= Billboard |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]] were coproducers with Snider, and Utley backed Snider and the Wrecks on keyboards.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/step-right-up-mw0000186371/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Step Right Up'': Credits |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= AllMusic |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's third album, ''Viva Satellite'', represented a turning point in his career. Prior to making the record, Margaritaville left MCA and signed with Island Records for distribution. But MCA retained rights to Snider's recordings, so they would release the album. No longer recording for Margaritaville or working with [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Brown]] and [[Michael Utley|Utley]], Snider produced some sides at engineer Justin Niebank's studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with mixed success. Only one of the tracks he cut there would make the album, the finale "Doublewide Blues." Snider recorded the rest of the album at Ardent Studios in Memphis with producer-engineer John Hampton. He was backed by [[Will Kimbrough|Kimbrough]] on guitar, Mariencheck on bass, [[Paul Buchignani]] on drums, and Rick Steff on keys, and the result was a more straight-ahead rock record than his first two.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Viva-Satellite/release/4832355 |title= Todd Snider –Viva Satellite |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> Shortly before the album was released in May 1998, there was trouble at a private performance in L.A. for MCA execs and their staffs. Snider, who was struggling with drugs at the time, insulted those in attendance early in the set and then left the stage. Not long thereafter, MCA released him from his contract.<ref>{{cite journal |last =Skanse |first =Richard |date=July 1, 2004 |title= Q&A: Todd Snider |url= https://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/qa-todd-snider/ |journal= Lone Star Music Magazine |access-date= August 29, 2021}}</ref>

===2000s===
====Oh Boy years====
After leaving MCA, Snider disbanded the Nervous Wrecks and signed with [[John Prine]]’s independent label, [[Oh Boy Records]]. Oh Boy released his fourth album, ''Happy To Be Here'', on April 18, 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= April 10, 2000 |title= Upcoming Releases |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XNPgrOvoqUkC&dq=todd+snider+happy+to+be+here&pg=PA37 |journal= CMJ New Music Report |pages= 37 |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Working with producer [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]], Snider recorded all the songs solo acoustic, then additional instrumentation was added to his guitar and vocal tracks.<ref>{{cite news |last= Lang |first= George |date= September 21, 2001 |title= Grunge survivor Todd Snider happy to be in the music business |url= https://www.oklahoman.com/article/2755931/grunge-survivor-todd-snider-happy-to-be-in-music-business |newspaper= The Oklahoman  |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Besides Kennedy who played a variety of instruments on the record, guitarists [[Pat Buchanan (musician)|Pat Buchanan]] and [[Will Kimbrough]], bassists [[Joey Spampinato]] and Keith Christopher, keyboardist [[Johnny Neel]], drummer [[Paul Buchignani]], multi-instrumentalist [[Peter Holsapple]], violinist [[Tammy Rogers]], and horn men Jim Hoke and [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] all contributed to the album.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-Happy-To-Be-Here/release/4899891 |title= Todd Snider – Happy To Be Here |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Oh Boy released Snider's second album for the label, ''[[New Connection]]'', on May 14, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://toddsnider.bandcamp.com/album/new-connection|title= Todd Snider |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= BandCamp |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> Produced by R.S. Field, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said of the album, "Snider has settled into a groove of consistent quality and potent observation."<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= May 18, 2002 |title= New Connection: On his fifth release and second for Nashville-based indie Oh Boy, Todd Snider finds himself in a comfortable, confident mode that easily taps into his often poignant, sometimes off-kilter world view |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1993/1993-05-15-Billboard-Page-0016.pdf#search=%22todd%20snider%22 |magazine= Billboard |page= 16 |access-date= July 26, 2021}}</ref> The record included "Beer Run," a crowd favorite that he had been performing since the summer of 2000. Prior to the song's release on ''New Connection'', [[Garth Brooks]] released a duet with [[George Jones]] in November 2001 that had the same title and same primary lyrical hook. Snider's manager wondered whether the song Brooks and Jones recorded infringed on his song of the same name, but ultimately it was concluded that while similar, their song had been written independently of Snider's.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/what-todd-snider-really-thinks-about-garth-brooks/ |title= What Todd Snider Really Thinks About Garth Brooks |last= Trigger |date= May 11, 2014 |website= SavingCountryMusic.com |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>

Snider's third Oh Boy release was a live album, ''Near Truths and Hotel Rooms'', which was released on May 13, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/near-truths-and-hotel-rooms-live-mw0000030777 |title= Todd Snider – ''Near Truths and Hotel Rooms'' |last= Ruhlman |first= William |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> The record, which was recorded at half a dozen venues, captured Snider's live show post-Nervous Wrecks — just him solo with his acoustic guitar and harmonica.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Whepley |first=  Brian |date= June 3, 2003 |title= Todd Snider - Near Truths And Hotel Rooms |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/todd-snider/todd-snider-near-truths-and-hotel-rooms/|journal= Paste |access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A− grade in his Consumer Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider|title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 3, 2021 }}</ref>

Snider's final studio album for Oh Boy, ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', was released on July 20, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/east-nashville-skyline-mw0000656524 |title= Todd Snider – ''East Nashville Skyline'' |last= Latham |first= Aaron |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> For the first time, Snider took full creative control of his record-making process,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sanders |first= Daryl |date= March 2011 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville's Ambassador to the World |url= https://www.theeastnashvillian.com/todd-snider/ |journal= The East Nashvillian |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> and the result was an album that was both a musical and cultural breakthrough.

In addition to guitarist Kimbrough and multi-instrumentalist McCullough, he was backed on the sessions by a who's who of East Nashville musicians, including guitarist Tim Carroll, bassists Dave Jacques and Dave Roe, drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright, and pianist John Deadrick. ''East Nashville Skyline'' included two iconic songs that added to the songwriting canon: "Play a Train Song" pushed the boundaries of "train" songs with the story of a man who was known for always requesting that kind of song, and "The Ballad of the Kingsmen" took the talking blues to a more contemporary place musically while connecting the censorship of "[[Louie Louie]]" culturally to the Columbine shootings.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-East-Nashville-Skyline/release/2657758 |title= Todd Snider –East NashvilleSkyline |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' called the album "the wittiest and feistiest album of his career."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Deusner |first= Stephen M. |date= December 14, 2004 |title= Todd Snider: East Nashville Skyline |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7797-east-nashville-skyline/ |journal= Pitchfork |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an A in his Consumer Guide and called it "a slacker wakeup call."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider|title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 }}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' ranked it the seventh-best album of 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/best2004-041228-gilstrap-2496022811.html |title= Best of 2004 |last= Gilstrap |first= Andrew |date= December 28, 2004 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref> ''East Nashville Skyline'' reached No. 28 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= August 7, 2004 |title= Top Independent Albums |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5BIEAAAAMBAJ&dq=east+nashville+skyline%2C+todd+snider&pg=PA61 |magazine= Billboard |pages= 61 |access-date= August 6, 2021}}</ref>

After ''[[East Nashville Skyline]]'', Snider moved to Bob Mercer's New Door Records label which was distributed by [[Universal Music Group]], but Oh Boy would issue one more album of his music. On April 3, 2007, the label released ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'', a compilation of previously unreleased recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-love-and-anarchy-rarities-b-sides-and-demos-vol-1-mw0000747312 |title= Todd Snider – ''Peace, Love And Anarchy (Rarities, B-Sides And Demos, Vol. I)'' |last= Deming |first= Mark |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> Notable among the collection's fourteen tracks is the song "East Nashville Skyline" which was intended to be the title track of the album of the same name but Snider did not finish it in time to make the album.

The collection, ''That Was Me: 1994-1998'', was released on August 30, 2005,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/that-was-me-the-best-of-todd-snider-1994-1998-mw0000417484 |title= Todd Snider – ''That Was Me: The Best of Todd Snider 1994-1998'' |last= Monger |first= James Christopher |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 30, 2021}}</ref> through their reissue arm, Hip-O Records.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Todd-Snider-That-Was-Me-1994-1998/release/2126555 |title= Todd Snider – That Was Me: 1994-1998 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Discogs |access-date= August 10, 2021}}</ref> The compilation included seventeen tracks from all three of the albums distributed by MCA, including "Alright Guy" and "Talking Seattle Grunge Rock Blues," plus a previously unreleased cover of "Margaritaville, a breakneck rendition on which he was backed by the Nervous Wrecks.

It was his final release on the New Door label.

====Launch of Aimless Records====
In 2008, Snider launched his own independent record label, Aimless Records. The label's first release was his eight-song EP ''[[Peace Queer]]'', the most political record of his career. The title was inspired by the ’60s avant garde rock band [[The Fugs]] who had a line about killing "peace queers."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jambase.com/article/todd-snider-is-so-queer |title= Todd Snider Is So Queer |last= Cook |first= Dennis |date= October 23, 2008 |website= Jambase |publisher= |access-date= August 13, 2021 }}</ref> As Snider tells it in the press bio for the album, he was kidnapped by an international league of peace queers who forced him to write the protest songs that appeared on the record. Three of the tracks on the EP were recorded at co-producer Eric McConnell's studio with backing from some of the musicians who worked on Snider's two previous albums, including guitarist [[Will Kimbrough]], bassist Dave Jacques, keyboardist [[Dave Zollo]], and drummers Paul Griffith and Craig Wright. The remainder of the EP was recorded with co-producer [[Doug Lancio]] at his studio with Lancio providing musical accompaniment and [[Patty Griffin]] contributing backing vocals to two of the tracks — "Cape Henry" and the cover of John Fogerty's "[[Fortunate Son]]." Released on October 14, 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-queer-mw0000795517/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''Peace Queer'': Credits |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> the record went to number one on the Americana Airplay Chart and number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= October 31, 2008 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

====Yep Roc album====
Aimless did not release Snider's next album, ''[[The Excitement Plan]]'', because he had already committed it to Yep Roc Records, but it would be the last record he would make for another record label. Produced by [[Don Was]] and released on June 9, 2009, the album featured Snider with minimal backing: Was on upright bass, [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, and [[Greg Leisz]] on dobro and pedal steel.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-excitement-plan-mw0000817699/credits |title= Todd Snider – ''The Excitement Plan'': Credits  |website= AllMusic |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''PopMatters'' called the record "a masterwork of intimacy" and said it "solidified his place among the masters of the form."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.popmatters.com/94859-todd-snider-the-excitement-plan-2496036027.html |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |last= Henderson |first= Stuart |date= June 16, 2009 |website= PopMatters |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> The Associated Press called it "the finest album of his career."<ref>{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Music Review: Snider finds humor in tough times |url= https://www.deseret.com/2009/6/8/20322379/music-review-snider-finds-humor-in-tough-times |newspaper= Deseret News |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave it four stars.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Hermes |first= Will |date= June 8, 2009 |title= Todd Snider: The Excitement Plan |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/27999157/review/28565381/the_excitement_plan |magazine= Rolling Stone |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613014403/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/27999157/review/28565381/the_excitement_plan |access-date= August 13, 2021|archive-date= June 13, 2009 }}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave it a B+ in his Consumer Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Todd+Snider |title= Todd Snider: Consumer Guide Reviews|last= Christgau|first= Robert |website= Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics |access-date= August 6, 2021 }}</ref> The album went to number six on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/tln/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Heatseekers Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref> and number 31 on the magazine's Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/artist/todd-snider/chart-history/ind/ |title= Chart History: Todd Snider: Independent Albums |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= June 26, 2009 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

The duo appeared on the charts in the late 1960s with a song titled "Hangin' On" on the Bakersfield International label, then with "Till The End" on Capitol Records. During the same time period, the Gosdin Brothers were featured on Hillman's former [[Byrds]] mate [[Gene Clark]]'s first solo album, the 1967 well-regarded ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]'',<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> singing backing vocals on all of the tracks behind the lead vocals of Clark and lead guitars of Clarence White, Glen Campbell, and Bill Rinehart (later of the Merry-Go-Round).

===1970s: Retirement and comeback===
Gosdin retired from performing during the 1970s and moved to Cartersville, Georgia, where he operated a glass company.<ref name="jw1-575"/> In 1976, he signed with [[Elektra Records]] and his first hit was a remake of "Hangin' On", which featured [[Emmylou Harris]] on harmony vocals and peaked at No.&nbsp;16.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His next single, "Yesterday's Gone" written by Wayne Hinsen Bradford who also wrote for Emmylou Harris, which also featured Harris, became his first Top 10 hit in 1977.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Several more hits followed between 1977 and 1979 with the biggest of these hits being a remake of "Till the End" and a cover of [[The Association]]'s "[[Never My Love]]" which also featured harmony vocals from [[Janie Frickie]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

===1981–1983: "Today My World Slipped Away"===
In 1981, Gosdin signed with [[Ovation Records]] and scored a Top 10 hit with "Dream of Me". After Ovation Records closed their doors later in 1981, Gosdin signed with A.M.I. Records where he scored a Top 10 hit in 1982 with "Today My World Slipped Away". (This song later became a number-three hit for [[George Strait]]).

In January 1982, during a trial that examined the attempted assassination of music producer [[Gary S. Paxton]], Darryl C. Langley claimed under oath that he and his cohort were hired attackers employed by Gosdin, who worked closely with Paxton and was alleged to be disgruntled in their working relationship. Gosdin was never arrested or charged and repeatedly refused to confirm or deny involvement for the remainder of his life.

Gosdin signed with Complete Records in the early 1980s, and, in 1984, released ''There Is A Season'', picked by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as best country album of the year.
The early 1980s also found a great combination of talent as Gosdin traveled from coast to coast opening shows for George Jones.

===1983–1985: "If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)"' and ''There Is a Season''===
Gosdin made the top 10 consistently in the early 1980s, really hitting his stride when he teamed with Barnes as a songwriting collaborator. The pair specialized in songs of cheating and barroom romance, often delivering an over-the-top emotionalism that got Gosdin compared to [[George Jones]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1983, Gosdin had two top 5 hits — "If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)" and "Way Down Deep" with the former earning him a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.]] The following year, he had his first No.&nbsp;1 single with "I Can Tell by the Way You Dance (You're Gonna Love Me Tonight)",<ref name="jw40"/> which had previously been recorded by [[Gary Morris]].<ref name="jw1-575"/> On September 22, 1985, Gosdin appeared at the original Farm Aid concert at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium.

===1987–1989: "Chiseled in Stone"===
After Compleat Records went bankrupt, Gosdin signed with Columbia in 1987. He immediately had success with "Do You Believe Me Now", and scored another No.&nbsp;1 hit with a tribute to [[Ernest Tubb]] called "Set 'Em Up Joe".<ref name="jw40"/> Gosdin's "[[Chiseled in Stone]]", co-written with Barnes, won the Country Music Association's Song of the Year award in 1989 and earned them a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]].

===1989–1990: ''Alone''===
Gosdin's 1989 album, ''Alone'', was a concept album in a traditional country style. It chronicled the dissolution of Gosdin's marriage and included his final number-one hit: "I'm Still Crazy".<ref name="jw40"/> From 1989 to 1991, he released a number of songs and three more made the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' top 10: "Right in the Wrong Direction", "That Just About Does It" and "Is It Raining at Your House". "Raining" has been covered by [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Lorrie Morgan]], and "That Just About Does It" by [[Willie Nelson]].

===Later years===
Gosdin suffered a stroke in 1998, but he continued writing and singing up until his death. In 2009, Gosdin collaborated with Joe Sins of the country music duo The Sins to write and record his final four songs.

==Death==
Gosdin suffered another stroke in early April 2009, and died at a Nashville hospital on the evening of April 28 at the age of 74.<ref name="Obit">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510233623/http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2015|title=Singer-Songwriter Vern Gosdin Dies in Nashville at Age 74|first=Calvin|last=Gilbert|website=CMT News|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> His remains were buried at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] in Nashville, Tennessee.

'''Warren William Zevon''' (January 24, 1947&nbsp;– September 7, 2003)<ref name="dies">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/warren-zevon-dies-250309/ |title=Warren Zevon Dies |last=Dansby |first=Andrew |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=September 8, 2003}}</ref> was an American rock singer and songwriter. His most famous compositions include "[[Werewolves of London]]", "[[Lawyers, Guns and Money]]", and "[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]". All three songs are featured on his third album, ''[[Excitable Boy]]'' (1978), the title track of which is also well-known. He also wrote major hits that were recorded by other artists, including "[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]", "Accidentally Like a Martyr", "[[Mohammed's Radio]]", "[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]", and "[[Hasten Down the Wind (song)|Hasten Down the Wind]]".

Zevon had early music industry successes as a session musician, jingle composer, songwriter, touring musician, musical coordinator, and bandleader. However, Zevon struggled to break through in his solo career until his music was performed by [[Linda Ronstadt]], beginning with her 1976 album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. It launched a cult following that lasted 25 years, with Zevon making occasional returns to album and single charts until his death from [[mesothelioma]] in 2003. He briefly found a new audience by teaming up with members of [[R.E.M.]] in the [[blues rock]] outfit [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods]] for a 1990 album release, although no tour followed. In 2023, Zevon was nominated for inclusion in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 Nominees {{!}} Rock & Roll Hall of Fame |url=https://www.rockhall.com/2023-nominees |access-date=February 1, 2023 |website=www.rockhall.com}}</ref>

Known for his dry wit and acerbic lyrics, he was a guest numerous times on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

==Early life==
Zevon was born in [[Chicago]], the son of Beverly Cope (née Simmons) and William Zevon. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, whose original surname was Zivotofsky.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite book | last = Zevon | first = Crystal | title = I'll Sleep When I'm Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon| publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2008 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-06-076349-7}}</ref> William Zevon worked as a bookie who handled volume bets and dice games for the notorious [[Los Angeles]] mobster [[Mickey Cohen]].<ref name=Tereba>{{cite book|last=Tereba|first= Tere|title= Mickey Cohen: The Life and Crimes of L.A.'s Notorious Mobster|location= New York|publisher=ECW Press|year= 2012|page=87|isbn=978-1-77041-063-3}}</ref> He worked for years in the  Cohen gang, in which he was known as Stumpy Zevon, and was best man at Cohen's first wedding.<ref>Tereba, p. 58.</ref> Warren's mother was from a [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] family and of English descent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/magazine/warren-zevon-s-last-waltz.html |title=Warren Zevon's Last Waltz|page= 4|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date=January 26, 2006 |access-date=June 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/zevon.html |title=Ancestry of Warren Zevon |publisher=Wargs.com |access-date=February 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper= Washington Post|title=Musician Warren Zevon Dies; Wrote 'Werewolves of London'|page=B6|date= September 9, 2003}}</ref> They later moved to [[Fresno, California]], and by the age of 13, Zevon was an occasional visitor to the home of [[Igor Stravinsky]], where he briefly studied modern classical music alongside [[Robert Craft]]. Zevon's parents divorced when he was 16 years old. He soon quit high school and moved from Los Angeles to New York City to become a folk singer.<ref name="Rolling Stone Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/warren-zevon/biography |title=Warren Zevon: Biography |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=RollingStone.com |access-date=November 22, 2013}}</ref>

Zevon turned to a musical career early, forming a musical duo with his high school friend, Violet Santangelo, called [[lyme and cybelle]]. [[Bones Howe]] produced their first single, the minor hit "Follow Me", which was written by Zevon and Santangelo and reached number 65 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100|pop charts]] in April 1966. A follow-up single, a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[If You Gotta Go, Go Now]]" flopped, and Zevon left the duo. A third single without Zevon and another session that included him but was not previously released were included on the 2003 compilation ''[[The First Sessions]]''.

Zevon spent time as a session musician and jingle composer. He wrote several songs for his [[White Whale Records|White Whale]] labelmates [[The Turtles]] ("Like the Seasons" and "Outside Chance"), though his participation in their recording—if any—is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/happy-together-mw0000113202/credits |author=Eder, Bruce |publisher= AllMusic.com |access-date=November 22, 2013|title=Review of The Turtles' Happy Together}}</ref> Another early Zevon composition ("She Quit Me") was included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969); to suit its place in the film, the song was re-recorded by Leslie Miller as "He Quit Me".

Zevon's first attempt at a solo album, ''[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Warren Zevon album)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]'' (1970), was spearheaded by 1960s cult figure [[Kim Fowley]] but received almost no attention and did not sell well. Though Zevon continued to play occasional live dates as a solo artist, the next several years of his career were dominated by session work with other musicians.

During the early 1970s, Zevon toured regularly with [[The Everly Brothers]] as keyboard player, band leader, and musical coordinator.<ref name="Rolling Stone Bio"/> Later the same decade, he toured with Don Everly and Phil Everly separately as they tried to launch solo careers after their breakup. He worked particularly closely with Phil, arranging and playing keyboards on his first and third solo albums (''Star Spangled Springer'' (1973) and ''Mystic Line'' (1975)) and co-writing tracks on his second and third albums (''Phil's Diner'' (1974) and the aforementioned ''Mystic Line''). Zevon's song "[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]" was also recorded by Canadian singer [[Murray McLauchlan]] on his [[Murray McLauchlan (album)|self-titled album]] of 1972.

These small successes were not particularly rewarding financially, and Zevon's dissatisfaction with his career (and a lack of funds) led him to briefly move to [[Spain]] in the summer of 1975. He lived and played in the Dubliner Bar, a small tavern in [[Sitges]], near [[Barcelona]], owned by David Lindell, who was a mercenary. Together they composed "[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]".

==Return to L.A. and major-label debut==

[[File:Warren Zevon 1976.jpg|thumb|right|Zevon in [[Heidelberg, Germany|Heidelberg]] as the opener for [[Jackson Browne]] in 1976. He toured solo.]]

By September 1975 Zevon had returned to Los Angeles, where he roomed with [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Lindsey Buckingham]], who had at this time become members of [[Fleetwood Mac]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Vogue|first1=the|last2=Zevon|first2=Warren|last3=Night|first3=Bumps in the|title=Warren Zevon — {{sic|Acciden|tly|hide=y}} Like a Martyr {{!}} Weekly View|url=http://weeklyview.net/2013/08/29/warren-zevon-accidently-like-a-martyr/|access-date=November 8, 2020|language=en-US}}</ref> There he collaborated with [[Jackson Browne]], who produced and promoted Zevon's self-titled major-label debut in 1976.<ref name="TG" /> Contributors to the album included Nicks, Buckingham, [[Mick Fleetwood]], [[John McVie]], members of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Carl Wilson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Bonnie Raitt]]. Ronstadt elected to record many of his songs, including "Hasten Down the Wind", "[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]", "[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]", and "[[Mohammed's Radio]]". Zevon's first tour, in 1977, included guest appearances in the middle of Jackson Browne concerts, one of which is documented on a widely circulated bootleg recording of a Dutch radio program under the title ''The Offender Meets the Pretender''.

Produced by Browne, ''[[Warren Zevon (album)|Warren Zevon]]'' (1976) was his first album to chart in the United States, peaking at No. 189.<ref name=TG>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/01/warren-zevon-werewolves-of-london-demons|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Warren Zevon: the man behind the demons|date=August 1, 2013|author=Freeman, Hadley}}</ref> The first edition of the ''[[Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' (published in 1979) called it "a masterpiece". The guide's latest edition (November 2004) calls it Zevon's "most realized work". Representative tracks include the junkie's lament "Carmelita"; the [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]-esque outlaw ballad "Frank and Jesse James"; "The French Inhaler", a scathing look at life and lust in the L.A. music business (which was actually about Marilyn Livingston, his long-time girlfriend and mother of his son, [[Jordan Zevon|Jordan]]);<ref name=TG/> and "[[Desperados Under the Eaves]]", a chronicle of Zevon's increasing alcoholism.

==Success==
In 1978, Zevon released ''[[Excitable Boy]]'' (produced by Jackson Browne and guitarist [[Waddy Wachtel]]) to critical acclaim and popular success. The title tune is about a juvenile [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]'s murderous prom night and referred to "Little Susie", the heroine of the song "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]" made famous by his former employers [[The Everly Brothers]]. Other songs such as "[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]" and "[[Lawyers, Guns and Money]]" used deadpan humor to wed geopolitical subtexts to hard-boiled narratives. Tracks from this album received heavy FM airplay, and the single release "[[Werewolves of London]]", which featured [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[John McVie]], was a relatively lighthearted work featuring Zevon's signature macabre outlook that reached No. 21 on the charts.

In ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' (1979), critic [[Dave Marsh]] called Zevon "one of the toughest rockers ever to come out of Southern California".<ref>[[Dave Marsh|Marsh, Dave]]; Swenson, John, eds. (1979). ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]''. New York: Random House.</ref>{{Rp|427}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' record reviews editor [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] called the album "one of the most significant releases of the 1970s" and placed Zevon alongside [[Neil Young]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] as the four most important new artists to emerge in the decade. On May 11, 1980, Zevon and [[Willie Nile]] appeared on the [[King Biscuit Flower Hour]].

[[File:LindaRonstadtPerforming.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Rondstadt singing into a microphone|Country rock musician [[Linda Ronstadt]] helped popularize Zevon's songs in the 1970s.]]
Zevon followed ''Excitable Boy'' with ''[[Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School]]'', in 1980. This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, better known under his nom-de-plume as the detective novelist [[Ross Macdonald]]. One of Zevon's literary heroes, Millar met the singer for the first time while participating in an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] organized by Nelson, which helped Zevon temporarily curtail his addictions. Featuring a modest hit with the single "A Certain Girl" (Zevon's cover of an [[R&B]] record by [[Ernie K-Doe]]) which reached No. 57 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, the album sold briskly but was uneven, and represented a decline rather than commercial and critical consistency. It contained a collaboration with [[Bruce Springsteen]] on the song "Jeannie Needs a Shooter" and the ballad "Empty-Handed Heart" featuring a [[descant]] sung by [[Linda Ronstadt]], which is about Zevon's divorce from his wife, Crystal, the mother of his daughter Ariel; she has been erroneously described in some sources as his "second wife".<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Pollak |first=Sally |date=May 29, 2015 |title=Unplugged in Peacham: Ariel Zevon builds a life in NEK |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2015/05/29/unplugged-peacham-living-grid/28072963/ |work=Burlington Free Press |location=Burlington, VT}}</ref> (Marilyn "Tule" Livingston, the mother of his son, [[Jordan Zevon|Jordan]], and Zevon were in a long-term relationship but never married.) Later in 1980, he released the live album ''[[Stand in the Fire]]'' (dedicated to [[Martin Scorsese]]), recorded over five nights at the [[The Roxy Theatre|Roxy Theatre]] in Los Angeles.

==Personal crisis and first comeback==
Zevon's 1982 release ''[[The Envoy (Warren Zevon album)|The Envoy]]'' returned to the high standard of ''Excitable Boy'' but was not a commercial success.<ref>{{citation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103083643/https://movies.nytimes.com/person/78550/Warren-Zevon|archive-date=November 3, 2012|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/78550/Warren-Zevon |title=Warren Zevon | first=Virginia | last=Heffernan |url-status=dead|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012| access-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref> It was an eclectic but characteristic set that included such compositions as "Ain't That Pretty at All", "Charlie's Medicine" and "Jesus Mentioned", the first of Zevon's two musical reactions to the death of [[Elvis Presley]]; the other is the song "Porcelain Monkey" on ''[[Life'll Kill Ya]]'' in 2000. The album also contains the first of Zevon's writing collaborations with respected writers of fiction: "The Overdraft", co-written with [[Thomas McGuane]]. The title track was dedicated to [[Philip Habib]], U.S. special envoy to the Middle East during the early 1980s. In the liner notes for the 1996 anthology ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead'', Zevon stated that after the song came out, Habib sent him "a very nice letter of appreciation on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] stationery".<ref>Zevon, Warren. ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead: An Anthology'' (liner notes). Artemis Records.</ref> The lyrics of another track, "The Hula Hula Boys", were excerpted in [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s 1983 book ''[[The Curse of Lono]]''.

In 1983 Zevon, who was recently divorced, became engaged to [[Philadelphia]] disc jockey Anita Gevinson and moved to the East Coast.<ref name= Valania>Valania, Jonathan (November 20, 2002). [http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/an_excitable_boy_they_all_said-38362274.html?page=2&comments=1&showAll= "An Excitable Boy, They All Said"]. Philadelphia Weekly.</ref> After ''The Envoy'' was poorly received by critics, [[Asylum Records]] ended their business relationship with Zevon, which Zevon discovered only when he read about it in the "Random Notes" column of ''Rolling Stone''. Following these career setbacks, he relapsed into drug and alcohol abuse. In 1984, he voluntarily checked himself into a rehab clinic in Minnesota. His relationship with Gevinson ended shortly thereafter.<ref name="Valania"/> Zevon retreated from the music business for several years, except for playing live solo shows; during this time he finally overcame severe alcohol and drug addictions.

During this time, Zevon collaborated with [[Bill Berry]], [[Peter Buck]] and [[Mike Mills]] (of [[R.E.M.]]), and backup vocalist Bryan Cook to form a minor project called [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods]]. The group released the non-charting single "Narrator" for [[IRS Records]] in 1984, then went into abeyance for several years.

Berry, Buck and Mills served as the core of Zevon's next studio band when he re-emerged in 1987 by signing with [[Virgin Records]] and recording the album ''[[Sentimental Hygiene]]''. The release, hailed as his best since ''Excitable Boy'', featured a thicker rock sound and taut, often humorous songs like "Detox Mansion", "Bad Karma" (which featured [[R.E.M.]] lead singer [[Michael Stipe]] on backup vocals), and "Reconsider Me". Included were contributions from [[Neil Young]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Brian Setzer]], and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], as well as Berry, Buck, and Mills. Also on hand were Zevon's longtime collaborators [[Jorge Calderón]] and [[Waddy Wachtel]].

During the ''Sentimental Hygiene'' sessions, Zevon also participated in an all-night jam session with Berry, Buck and Mills, as they worked their way through rock and blues numbers by artists including [[Bo Diddley]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. Though the sessions were not initially intended for release, they eventually were as [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods']] [[Hindu Love Gods (album)|sole album]].

The immediate follow-up to ''Sentimental Hygiene'' was 1989's ''[[Transverse City]]'', a futuristic [[concept album]] inspired by Zevon's interest in the work of [[cyberpunk]] science fiction author [[William Gibson]]. It featured guests including [[Little Feat]] drummer [[Richie Hayward]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Hot Tuna]] bassist [[Jack Casady]], noted jazz keyboardist [[Chick Corea]] and various guitarists, including Wachtel, [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[David Gilmour]] and [[Neil Young]]. Key tracks include the title song, "Splendid Isolation", "Run Straight Down" (which had a promotional video that featured Zevon singing in a factory while Gilmour played guitar solos), and "They Moved the Moon" (one of Zevon's eerier ballads).

==Later years and second comeback==
''Transverse City'' was a commercial disappointment, and Zevon was dropped by Virgin Records soon after the album's release. He almost immediately contracted, however, with [[Irving Azoff]]'s new label [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]]. The first release under Zevon's contract with his new distributor was the album ''[[Hindu Love Gods (album)|Hindu Love Gods]]'', recorded during the ''Sentimental Hygiene'' sessions. The album included a cover of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Raspberry Beret]]", which became a number 23 Modern Rock hit in the United States.

In 1991, Zevon who once again was a solo artist, released ''[[Mr. Bad Example]]''. The album featured the modest pop hit "Searching for a Heart" and the rocker "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead", later used as the title of the [[neo-noir]] [[Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead|film of the same name]], directed by [[Gary Fleder]]; after some skirmishing over the unauthorized use of Zevon's song title, the Zevon track was licensed to play over the film's end credits. Zevon also sang lead vocals on the song "Casey Jones" from the Grateful Dead tribute album ''[[Deadicated]]'', with regular collaborator David Lindley.

Zevon toured the United States (with the [[Odds (band)|Odds]]), Europe, Australia and New Zealand during this period. Owing to his reduced circumstances, his performances were often true solo efforts with minimal accompaniment on piano and guitar;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/noevalleyvoice167unse|title=Noe Valley Voice|date=October 1, 1992|publisher=Sarah Smith & Jack Tipple|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/THE-MUSIC-MAN-2507072.php|title=The Music Man|date=January 8, 2006|publisher=[[SFGate]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=March 31, 2018|title=Music Series Bids Farewell to Ministry Stage: Reprise Possible in Two Years|author=World, Heather|url=http://www.noevalleyvoice.com/2010/November/NVMS.htm|website=Noevalleyvoice.com|date=November 2010}}</ref> the live album ''[[Learning to Flinch]]'' (1993) documents such a tour. Zevon often played in [[Colorado]] to allow for an opportunity to visit with his longtime friend [[Hunter S. Thompson]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4zPCwAAQBAJ&q=zevon+often+played+colorado&pg=PA136|title=Warren Zevon: Desperado of Los Angeles|author=Plasketes, George|page=136|date=2016|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|isbn=9781442234574}}</ref>

A lifelong fan of [[hardboiled fiction]], Zevon was friendly with several well-known writers, who also collaborated on his songwriting during this period, including Thompson, [[Carl Hiaasen]] and [[Mitch Albom]]. Zevon also served as musical coordinator and occasional guitarist for an ad-hoc rock music group called the [[Rock Bottom Remainders]], a collection of writers performing rock-and-roll standards at book fairs and other events. The group included [[Stephen King]], [[Dave Barry]], [[Matt Groening]] and [[Amy Tan]], among other popular writers; it has continued to perform one benefit concert per year since Zevon's death.

An affiliated project for which Zevon both played and wrote liner notes is the offbeat 1998 album ''[[Stranger Than Fiction (Rock Bottom Remainders album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'', a two-CD set attributed to the Wrockers, containing rock covers and originals by many of the Remainders authors plus such notables as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Maya Angelou]]. Zevon oversaw music for the short-lived revival of the [[NBC]] series ''[[Route 66 (television series)|Route 66]]'' (1993), contributing that show's main title theme, "If You Won't Leave Me I'll Find Somebody Who Will". His music was also featured in the four [[William Shatner]] ''[[TekWar]]'' movies in 1994. Zevon is listed as "theme music composer" in the opening credits. His song "Real or Not" was used as the show's end credit theme song. The song appeared on Zevon's 2-CD set, ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology)''. In the accompanying booklet, Zevon wrote, "I wrote this song for the William Shatner TV movies based on his novels. He ''is'' Captain Kirk, rest assured. He'd call me at home and demand to hear the song in progress, then he'd say "We need more guitars! More driving guitars!" It was cool. The track reflected my secret fondness for sleazy English techno records."

Occasionally between 1982 and 2001, Zevon filled in for [[Paul Shaffer]] as bandleader on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and later the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

In 1995, Zevon released the self-produced ''[[Mutineer (album)|Mutineer]]''. The title track was frequently covered by Bob Dylan on his U.S. fall tour in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjorner.com/2002%206%207.htm |title=Dylan Set Lists at Olaf's Files for 2002|publisher=Bjorner.com |access-date=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Zevon's cover of cult artist [[Judee Sill]]'s "Jesus Was a Crossmaker" predated the wider rediscovery of her work a decade later. The album, however, had the worst sales of Zevon's career, in part because of lack of promotion from his label, Giant. [[Rhino Records]] released a Zevon "best-of" compilation in 1996, ''[[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology)|I'll Sleep When I'm Dead]]''. Zevon also appeared on the ''[[Larry Sanders Show]]'' on [[HBO]], in 1993, playing himself as a guest on the show, promoting ''[[Learning to Flinch]]''. Zevon also played himself on two episodes of ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'' in 1999, along with singer and actor [[Rick Springfield]].

[[File:David Letterman 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Comedian and TV host [[David Letterman]] was credited by Zevon as "being the best friend my music ever had".<ref name="nyt-last"/>]]

After another five-year layoff, Zevon signed with industry veteran Danny Goldberg's [[Artemis Records]] and again rebounded with the mortality-themed 2000 release ''[[Life'll Kill Ya]]'', containing the hymn-like "Don't Let Us Get Sick" and an austere version of [[Steve Winwood]]'s 1980s hit "Back in the High Life Again". With record sales brisk and music critics giving Zevon his best notices since ''Excitable Boy'', ''[[Life'll Kill Ya]]'' is seen as his second comeback. He followed with the album ''[[My Ride's Here]]'' (2002), with its morbid prescience of things to come; the album included "Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)" (co-written by [[Mitch Albom]], the author of ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie]]'', and featuring [[Paul Shaffer]], the ''Late Night'' band, and a spoken vocal from TV host [[David Letterman]]) and the ballad "Genius"—written with Pulitzer Prize and T.S. Eliot Prize-winning poet, Paul Muldoon—later used as the title of an anthology of Zevon's recordings in 2002.

At about this time, he and the actor [[Billy Bob Thornton]] formed a close friendship, catalyzed by their common experiences with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and the fact they lived in the same apartment building.<ref name="ReferenceA" />  In 2000, Zevon appeared with Thornton in the movie [[South of Heaven, West of Hell]], written and directed by [[Dwight Yoakam]]. One of Zevon's compulsions was buying and hoarding identical gray [[Calvin Klein]] T-shirts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qo1jl_eNq0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/5qo1jl_eNq0| archive-date=November 9, 2021 | url-status=live|title=Crystal Zevon Reads Passage from Book|date=May 31, 2007|publisher=YouTube.com|access-date=May 20, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Cancer and ''The Wind''==

{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}
In interviews, Zevon described a lifelong [[Fear of medical procedures#Fear of doctors|phobia of doctors]] and said he seldom consulted one. He had started working out, and he looked physically fit. Shortly before playing at the [[Edmonton Folk Music Festival]] in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and developed a chronic cough. After a period of suffering with pain and shortness of breath, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a physician; he was diagnosed with pleural [[mesothelioma]], a cancer (usually caused by exposure to asbestos) that affects the [[Pulmonary pleurae|pleura]], a thin membrane around the lungs and chest lining. Zevon was deeply shaken by the news and began drinking again after 17 years of sobriety.<ref name="ringer">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/9/7/17830460/warren-zevon-career-music-albums |title=His Sh*t's F***ed Up: The Complicated Legacy of Warren Zevon |last=Hyden |first=Steven |author-link=Steven Hyden |website=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |date=September 7, 2018 |access-date=September 8, 2018}}</ref>

Although Zevon never revealed where he may have been exposed to asbestos, his son Jordan suggests that it came from Zevon's childhood, playing in the attic of his father's carpet store in Arizona. Refusing treatments he believed might incapacitate him, Zevon instead began recording his final album, ''[[The Wind (Warren Zevon album)|The Wind]]'', which includes performances by close friends including [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Don Henley]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]]. At the request of the music television channel [[VH1]], documentarian Nick Read was given access to the sessions and made the television film ''Inside Out: Warren Zevon''.<ref name="bbt">{{cite web |url=http://www.billybobthornton.net/tv%20specials%20warren%20vh1%20zevon%20news%20break.html |title=Inside Out: Warren Zevon |publisher=[[Billy Bob Thornton]] site |access-date=September 10, 2018 |archive-date=March 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311031550/http://www.billybobthornton.net/tv%20specials%20warren%20vh1%20zevon%20news%20break.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:JacksonBrowne3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Browne holding a guitar and smiling|Friend [[Jackson Browne]] reunited with Zevon for his final album]]
On October 30, 2002, Zevon was [[Warren Zevon on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2002|featured alone on an episode]] of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' as the only guest for the entire hour. The band played "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" as his introduction. Zevon performed several songs and spoke at length about his illness. Zevon had been a frequent guest and occasional substitute bandleader on Letterman's television shows since ''[[Late Night with David Letterman|Late Night]]'' was first broadcast in 1982. He noted, "I might have made a tactical error in not going to a physician for 20 years." It was during this broadcast that, when asked by Letterman if he knew something more about life and death now, he first offered his oft-quoted insight that people need to "enjoy every sandwich."<ref name="nyt-last">{{cite news | work= The New York Times | title = Warren Zevon's Last Waltz | first= Jon | last = Pareles | date = January 26, 2003| access-date = March 27, 2013 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/magazine/warren-zevon-s-last-waltz.html}}</ref> He also thanked Letterman for his years of support, calling him "the best friend my music's ever had". For his final song of the evening, and his final public performance, Zevon performed "[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]" at Letterman's request. In the green room after the show, Zevon presented Letterman with the guitar that he always used on the show, with a single request: "Here, I want you to have this, take good care of it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/03/david-letterman-hints-at_n_123450.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905233454/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/03/david-letterman-hints-at_n_123450.html|archive-date=September 5, 2008|title=David Letterman Hints at the End of His Late Night Career, Defends Leno Against NBC's Decision |work= [[HuffPost]]| date= September 3, 2008|access-date=June 29, 2010 }}</ref>

==Posthumous releases and awards==
A tribute album titled ''[[Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon]]'' was released October 19, 2004. Zevon's son, [[Jordan Zevon]], was the executive producer of the album and performed "Studebaker", a previously unfinished composition by his father. A second tribute album, ''Hurry Home Early: The Songs of Warren Zevon'' ("hurry home early" is from the song "Boom Boom Mancini", on the album ''Sentimental Hygiene'') was released by [[Wampus Multimedia]] on July 8, 2005.

On February 14, 2006, [[VH1 Classic]] premiered a music video from a new compilation, ''[[Reconsider Me: The Love Songs]]''. The video, titled "She's Too Good for Me", aired every hour on the hour throughout the day.

Noteworthy rarities include the outtakes "Word of Mouth" and "The Risk" from the ''Envoy'' sessions and "Frozen Notes (Strings Version)", a melancholy outtake from ''Excitable Boy'' performed on acoustic piano with a string quartet.

Ammal Records was a new label started up as a partnership with [[New West Records]] by Zevon's former boss at Artemis, [[Danny Goldberg]]. On May 1, 2007, Ammal released ''[[Preludes: Rare and Unreleased Recordings]]'', a two-disc anthology of Zevon demos and alternate versions culled from 126 pre-1976 recordings that had been kept in a suitcase. The album contains five previously unreleased songs: "Empty Hearted Town", "Going All the Way", "Steady Rain", "Stop Rainin' Lord" and "The Rosarita Beach Cafe", along with Zevon's original demo of "Studebaker".

''The Wind'' was certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[RIAA]] in December 2003, and Zevon received five posthumous [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, including Song of the Year for the ballad "Keep Me in Your Heart".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/05/movies/they-re-all-contenders.html|title=They're All Contenders|date=December 5, 2003|access-date=October 19, 2021|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> ''The Wind'' won two Grammys, with the album itself receiving the award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, while "Disorder in the House", Zevon's duet with Bruce Springsteen, was awarded Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. These posthumous awards were the first Grammys of Zevon's thirty-plus year career.

== Personal life ==
Zevon was married to Crystal, and their daughter Ariel Zevon was born in 1976.

== Biographical works ==
''[[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon]]'', a biography by his ex-wife, Crystal Zevon, was published in 2007 by [[Ecco Books]]. The book is largely an oral history that consists of interviews with Zevon's friends, relatives and associates, as well as excerpts from his diaries. Crystal Zevon said Warren had given her permission to use the journal excerpts and instructed her to present an unvarnished portrayal of his life that did not sanitize his many struggles.

George Plasketes, a professor at [[Auburn University]], wrote a critical study of Zevon's music in 2016, ''Warren Zevon, Desperado of Los Angeles''. Zevon was also the subject of Michael Flood's essay "Lord Byron's Luggage: Warren Zevon and the Redefinition of Literature Rock". A collection of short stories by Kelly Lynn Thomas, ''Miss Gun to a Knife Fight: Stories'', is composed of retellings of songs by Zevon.

In 2012, George Gruel, a photographer who worked as Zevon's aide-de-camp from 1978 to 1983, published a book of photos of Zevon. It is entitled ''Lawyers, Guns and Photos''.<ref>Gruel, George (2012).

'''Wilco''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[Chicago]]. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of [[alternative country]] group [[Uncle Tupelo]] after singer [[Jay Farrar]]'s departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] and bassist [[John Stirratt]] remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004 the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist [[Nels Cline]], multi-instrumentalist [[Pat Sansone]], keyboard player [[Mikael Jorgensen]], and drummer [[Glenn Kotche]]. Wilco has released thirteen studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with [[Billy Bragg]] and one with [[the Minus 5]].

Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles including [[Bill Fay]], [[the Beatles]], and [[Television (band)|Television]]; in turn the band has influenced music by many modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the [[alternative country]] style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]'' (1995), but has since introduced more [[experimental music|experimental]] aspects to their music, including elements of [[alternative rock]] and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current "eclectic [[indie rock]] collective that touches on many eras and genres".<ref>{{cite web |date=September 25, 2012 |title=Indie-Rockers Wilco Make First Appearance At The Cascade Theatre Sept 26 |url=http://anewscafe.com/2012/09/25/indie-rockers-wilco-make-first-appearance-at-the-cascade-theatre-sept-26/ |author=Press Release}}</ref>

Wilco received media attention for their fourth album, ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, [[Reprise Records]] rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming ''Foxtrot'' on its website, Wilco sold the album to [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of [[Warner Music Group]], leading a critic to say the album showed "how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|author-link=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/yankee-hotel-foxtrot-250882/|title=Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (review)|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 9, 2002|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912001355/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot |archive-date = September 12, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> The event was immortalized in the documentary [[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|''I Am Trying to Break Your Heart'']]; director [[Sam Jones (photographer)|Sam Jones]] followed the band as they wrote and produced the record. ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two [[Grammy Award]]s for their fifth studio album, 2004's ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'', including [[Best Alternative Music Album]]. Wilco released their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Cousin (album)|Cousin]]'', in September 2023.

{{Main|Uncle Tupelo}}
Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group [[Uncle Tupelo]]. Singer [[Jay Farrar]] quit the band in 1994 because of a soured relationship with co-singer [[Jeff Tweedy]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html|title=Jay Farrar Traces a Path Away from Uncle Tupelo|work=[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]|date=Fall 1995|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002617/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html |archive-date = September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed July 9, 2007.</ref> Both Tweedy and Farrar immediately sought to form bands after the breakup, with Farrar organizing [[Son Volt]]. Tweedy's new band included all current members of Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including [[bassist]] John Stirratt, [[drummer]] [[Ken Coomer]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]]. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist [[Brian Henneman]] of [[the Bottle Rockets]] to perform, who appears on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, ''[[A.M.

Although Tweedy said that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract.<ref name="Kot1">Kot 2004. p. 92</ref> Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission—John Stirratt's "It's Just That Simple"—appeared on ''A.M.''. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.<ref name="Kot1"/>

Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on ''A.M.'' was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."<ref>{{cite news|last=Cameron|first=Keith|title=Last Twang in Town|publisher=Vox|date=May 1997}}</ref> ''A.M.'' peaked at number twenty-seven on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, [[Son Volt]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 15, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|magazine=Billboard|date=October 7, 1995}}</ref> The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the ''[[Village Voice]]'''s 1995 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=George-Warren|first=Holly|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-m-187587/|title=Wilco: ''A.M.''

{{Listen|filename=I Must Be High.ogg|title="I Must Be High"|description=Sample from "I Must Be High", the first track from ''A.M.''. The song is an example of the straightforward alternative country music described by Tweedy as "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (the band was billed for the occasion as "[[Black Shampoo]]").<ref>{{cite news|last=Kuelker|first=Michael|title=New Wilco Satisfies Tupelo Fans|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|date=November 19, 1994}} Last accessed September 2, 2007.</ref> During the two hundred-date tour supporting ''A.M.'', Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 110–1</ref>

<blockquote>The whole ''[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]'' thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on "Misunderstood," where I'm playing guitar.</blockquote>

Wilco recorded a number of songs with this theme, including "Sunken Treasure" and "Hotel Arizona."<ref>Kot 2004. p. 112</ref> Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of ''A.M.''<ref name="ND">{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html|title=Being There, Doing That|publisher=No Depression|date=September 1996|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070507025218/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html |archive-date = May 7, 2007|url-status=dead}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.</ref> Wilco named the album ''[[Being There (Wilco album)|Being There]]'' after a [[Peter Sellers]] [[Being There|film of the same name]]. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of [[Freakwater]] briefly joined the band in the studio, playing [[pedal steel guitar]] on "Far, Far Away" and "Dreamer in My Dreams", and then became an official member in September 1996.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 115</ref><ref>Kot 2004. p. 119</ref>

Unlike the ''A.M.'' recording sessions, the band had no desire to produce a hit song from their second effort.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 114</ref> The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a [[double album]] would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 116</ref> ''Being There'' was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="ND"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Deming |first=Mark |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=being-there-mw0000613155#review|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Being There'' Review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325044108/http://www.allmusic.com/album/being-there-r241294/review |title=Original review by Jason Ankeny |date=March 25, 2011}}.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/being-there-203447/|title=Being There |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 24, 1996|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070619094452/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/240156/review/5946124/being_there |archive-date = June 19, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref> The album reached No. 73 on the ''Billboard'' album charts,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|magazine=Billboard|date=November 16, 1996}}</ref> a significant improvement from ''A.M.'', and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres96.php|title=The 1996 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.</ref> The album's single "Outtasite (Outta Mind)" became the group's first song to enter the ''Billboard'' charts, reaching No. 39 on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No. 22 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wilco Awards |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=wilco-mn0000254215#awards|pure_url=yes}} |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}}</ref>

===''Summerteeth'' and the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions (1997–2000)===
In November 1997, Wilco entered [[Willie Nelson]]'s recording studio in [[Spicewood]], [[Texas]] to record a third studio album.<ref name="Kot-2004">Kot 2004. p. 138</ref> The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century [[literature]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 135</ref> Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's "bold, but depressing" lyrics.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 140–1</ref> Wilco recorded several songs, including "Via Chicago" and "She's a Jar", but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.<ref name="Kot-2004"/>
[[File:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|left|thumb|The two ''Mermaid Avenue'' albums  are recordings of unreleased [[Woody Guthrie]] (''pictured'') songs]]
[[Nora Guthrie]] contacted singer-songwriter [[Billy Bragg]] in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]]. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of [[Huntington's disease]]. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a "relic" to the [[MTV generation]], and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was "the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody." Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 143</ref>

Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their ''Being There'' tour. Bragg was particularly fond of ''Being There'' because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs with one of his idols—Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]]. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a "freak weirdo." The recording of ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of [[BBC]]'s ''[[Man in the Sand]]'' documentary film.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 144–5</ref>

Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded "you make your record, and I'll make mine..." Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.

Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 151–3</ref> The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and ''Rolling Stone'', and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marcus|first=Greil|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/kicking-television-live-in-chicago-249386/|title=Mermaid Avenue |magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 1, 1998|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071002102709/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/225606/review/6213088/mermaid_avenue |archive-date = October 2, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=2579&name=Billy+Bragg+%26+Wilco|title=CG: Billy Bragg & Wilco|publisher=robertchristgau.com}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres98.php|title=The 1998 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist [[Leroy Bach]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 169</ref>

After the completion of the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, ''[[Summerteeth]]''. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with [[Pro Tools]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 154–5</ref> Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 158</ref>

<blockquote>The story of ''Summerteeth'' is Jay bought a [[Mellotron]] and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness&nbsp;... It reminds me of ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.</blockquote>

During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with [[Time Inc.]]<ref>Kot 2004. p. 161</ref> As a result, Warner's [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, [[Howie Klein]], who had previously authorized the release of ''Being There'' as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce ''Summerteeth'' without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this "once and once only" and recorded a radio-friendly version of "Can't Stand It" at the request of [[David Kahne]], the head of the A&R department.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 162–5</ref> The single version of "Can't Stand It" failed to cross over from [[Adult album alternative|Triple-A]] radio to alternative rock stations. The album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than ''Being There''<ref>Kot 2004. p. 167</ref> despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres99.php|title=The 1999 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 15, 2007.</ref>

After the release of ''[[Summerteeth]]'', the band resumed the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]''. "Someday Some Morning Sometime," featuring a [[vibraphone]] filtered through a [[space echo]], was identified by Tweedy as being the "piece to the puzzle" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 175</ref> The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. III]]'', also part of ''[[Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions]]''.

===Departure from Reprise Records and ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' (2001–2002)===
[[File:Marina City, Chicago, Illinois, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-20, DD 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Marina City|Marina Towers]] in [[Chicago, IL|Chicago]] are depicted on the cover of ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]].]]
{{Listen|filename=I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.ogg|title="I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"|description=The first track from ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', this song featured an intro on bells composed by Glenn Kotche.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Shortly after the recording sessions for ''Mermaid Avenue Vol. II'', Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 168</ref> The band recorded tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (album)|Bad Timing]]''. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer [[Glenn Kotche]], and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named [[Loose Fur]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 177–9</ref> Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 186–8</ref>

Although Bennett sought to be the mixer and engineer for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities compared to O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 195–6</ref> Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart", and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as "Poor Places", only featured the Loose Fur trio.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 198–9</ref> The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|title=In from the Cold|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=May 2002}}</ref> The recording of the album was documented by [[Sam Jones (filmmaker)|Sam Jones]] and released in 2002 as the film ''[[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco]]''.

Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with [[America Online]] in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. 

David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 201</ref> Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disliked the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 202</ref> He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the [[album]] was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 203</ref>

Wilco managed to negotiate a buy-out from Reprise. [[Music journalist]] Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot''.<ref>Kot 2004, p. 207</ref> The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0108150038aug15.story?coll=chi-leisure-hed|title=Wilco's Shot in the Arm|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 15, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010826133635/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0108150038aug15.story?coll=chi-leisure-hed|archive-date=August 26, 2001}} Last accessed via the [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] on July 15, 2007.</ref> However, AllMusic claims "Warner/[[Reprise Records|Reprise]] agreed to sell them the masters for a reported $50,000" after Wilco was "unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable'." In a last-minute decision, the label freed Wilco from their contract and gave them the album at no charge.<ref name="AllMusic biography">{{cite web |last=Deming |first=Mark |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=wilco-mn0000254215#biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Wilco Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 15, 2024}}</ref> Curbing the negative publicity, Warner Music Group began to invest more in bands including [[The Flaming Lips]]. Lead singer [[Wayne Coyne]] remarked:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 209</ref>

<blockquote>We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, "we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again." They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!</blockquote>

As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it on their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality [[MP3]]s.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 225–6</ref> The band signed with [[Nonesuch Records]], another [[Time Warner]] subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002.

In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed ''Foxtrot'' and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike ''Summerteeth'' and ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'' featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live.<ref name="Kot3">Kot 2004. p. 240–1</ref> The album featured the song "Less Than You Think", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called "the track that everyone will hate". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song:<ref name="Kot3"/>

{{blockquote|I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say it's a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great&nbsp;... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it.}}

Reviewer James Brubaker says that Wilco "shine[s] on a handful of the songs" on ''Sky Blue Sky'', such as the "light, and straightforward" songs.

=== Jay Bennett documentary, ''Cruel Country'', and ''Cousin'' (2021–present)===
In 2021, a feature-length documentary about the life of Jay Bennett was released. The film focused heavily on Bennett's years with Wilco. Directed by [[Gorman Bechard]] and Fred Uhter, the music documentary held its world premiere in Chicago in November 2021;<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilkinson |first=Sean |title=A documentary on Jay Bennett is coming to the Davis Theater in Chicago |url=https://www.smilepolitely.com/splog/a_documentary_on_jay_bennett_is_coming_to_the_davis_theater_in_chicago/ |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=Smile Politely |date=November 10, 2021 }}</ref> it was released on Blu Ray and pay-per-view on April 19, 2022, and as part of a [[Record Store Day]] release with vinyl editions of Bennett's last two albums, ''Whatever Happened I Apologize'' and ''Kicking at the Perfumed Air'' on April 23, 2022.<ref>{{Citation |title=RSD '22 Special Release: Jay Bennett - "Kicking at the Perfumed Air" & "Whatever Happened I Apologize" with the film "Where are you, Jay Bennett?" |url=https://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/14740 |language=en |access-date=2022-06-14}}</ref>

"The new film does a wonderful job of capturing the quirkiness, inventiveness and brilliance of someone who never met an instrument he couldn't play. Bennett once described hearing the open spaces of the songs and holes that became his sonic landscape. They were at the core of the remarkable string of Wilco's albums ''[[Being There (Wilco album)|Being There]]'', ''[[Summerteeth]],'' and ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]''."<ref>{{cite web |last=Wosahla |first=Steve |date=2022-04-21 |title=Jay Bennett, Gone Too Soon (Where are you, Jay Bennett?–Film Review) |url=https://americanahighways.org/2022/04/21/jay-bennett-gone-too-soon-where-are-you-jay-bennett-film-review/ |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=Americana Highways}}</ref>

The film was originally started by Uhter, who asked the prolific Bechard to take over the project when it stalled. It takes a hard look at Bennett's treatment in the previous Wilco documentary, ''[[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|I Am Trying To Break Your Heart]]'', which many consider to be unfair. "Jay Bennett's reputation never quite recovered from the battering it took in Sam Jones' documentary ''I Am Trying To Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco'', about the complex, lengthy gestation of 2002's ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' in often painful detail, portrayed a band slowly pulling itself apart, with chief songwriters Bennett and Jeff Tweedy its twin opposing forces. The implication being that Bennett was a headstrong, intractable figure responsible for most of the discord. He was sacked as soon as the album was done. Filmmakers Gorman Bechard and Fred Uhter seek to redress the balance on ''Where Are You, Jay Bennett?"''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-27 |title=Where are you, Jay Bennett? |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/film-reviews/where-are-you-jay-bennett-138572/ |access-date=2022-06-13 |website=UNCUT |language=en-GB}}</ref> The film painted a much more balanced picture of the relationship between Bennett and Tweedy. "They just happened to be two egos at that point, fueled by a lot of demons. And it just wasn't working anymore," Bechard explained. "They're both incredibly talented. They both had egos. They both, I think, saw maybe different paths for the band. And ultimately it was Jeff's band, so he's going to win that, and rightfully so. There were other issues, whether it be alcohol or drugs. You know, it was a little bit of everything. Personally, I wish they had stayed together because I think they could have literally become the next Lennon and McCartney or the next Jagger/Richards."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gotcher |first=Steve |date=2022-05-06 |title={{-'}}Where are you, Jay Bennett?' documentary chronicles his impact on Wilco and beyond |url=https://www.wpr.org/where-are-you-jay-bennett-documentary-chronicles-his-impact-wilco-and-beyond |access-date=2022-06-14 |website=[[Wisconsin Public Radio]]}}</ref>

In April 2022, the band announced their twelfth studio album, ''[[Cruel Country]]'', which they released on May 27.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Corcoran |first=Nina |date=April 28, 2022 |title=Wilco Announce New Album Cruel Country, Share New Song "Falling Apart (Right Now)": Listen |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/wilco-announce-new-album-cruel-country-share-new-song-falling-apart-right-now-listen/ }}</ref> The album was recorded entirely in person in live sessions at The Loft, the first album since 2007's ''Sky Blue Sky.'' Tweedy described the album as saying, "We've never been particularly comfortable with accepting [...] the idea that I was making country music. But now, having been around the block a few times, we're finding it exhilarating to free ourselves within the form, and embrace the simple limitation of calling the music we're making country."<ref name=":0" />

In August 2023, the band announced their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Cousin (album)|Cousin]]'', which they released on September&nbsp;29.

==Early life==
Brown was raised on [[Lake Lanier]], Georgia by his mother, Bettye, and stepfather Dr. Jody Moses, a dentist in [[Cumming, Georgia]]. The eleventh of twelve children, Brown attended Mashburn Elementary School in Cumming; [[Lakeview Academy]] in [[Gainesville, Georgia]]; and [[South Forsyth High School]] in Cumming. At age he moved to [[Dahlonega, Georgia]] where he graduated from [[Lumpkin County High School]]. Brown was given his mother's guitar at age 8, and one of his stepfather's patients was enlisted to teach him classical guitar. He completed two years of lessons, but soon after developed a love for [[bluegrass music]] while playing with his father and brother on weekend visits. In his mid-teens, Brown spent almost a year being tutored by a vocal coach from his church.

While still in high school, with [[James Taylor]] as his inspiration, Brown began playing solo gigs in local venues, performing country and pop [[cover version|cover]] songs. Brown attended the [[University of West Georgia]], where he became a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Order]] fraternity. He was also a camp counselor at Camp Mikell in [[Toccoa, Georgia]], and Camp Glisson, a United Methodist summer camp and retreat center located in Dahlonega.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Alumni News| journal = The Kappa Alpha Order Journal| date = Summer 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ben-Yehuda|first=Ayala|title=Music: Happening Now - Zac Attack|magazine=Billboard |date=Oct 25, 2008|volume=120|issue=43|page=36|id={{ProQuest|1020474}}}}</ref> Brown later founded Camp Southern Ground, a 501c3 nonprofit camp in [[Fayetteville, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/zac-brown-band/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115014556/http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/zac-brown-band/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2014|title=Zac Brown Band &#124; Little Kids Rock|date=January 15, 2014}}</ref>
