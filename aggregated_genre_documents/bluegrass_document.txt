'''Adrienne Adeana Young''' is an American [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]-based singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.  She is founder and operator of AddieBelle Music which produces her recordings.

== History ==
A native of [[Tallahassee, Florida]], in fact a seventh-generation Floridian, she was raised on the land farmed by her family generations earlier.<ref name="adrienneyoung.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.adrienneyoung.com/roots |title=Roots - Adrienne Young |access-date=2008-02-27 |archive-date=2008-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222193417/http://www.adrienneyoung.com/roots |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Young grew up in a musical family in [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]], where she was a member of the band [[Big White Undies]].

She was graduated magna cum laude from [[Belmont University]] in Nashville with a music business/Spanish degree. Endless and unfulfilling clerical jobs along [[Music Row]] motivated this triple-threat singer, writer, and multi-instrumentalist to start her own [[record label]], Addiebelle Music.<ref name="adrienneyoung.com"/> She also formed the short-lived band Liters of Pop with [[Eric McConnell]].

She learned to play clawhammer-style banjo from Ketch Secor of [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], and set about amassing a catalog of [[old-time music|old-time]] tunes.  As she says:

{{blockquote|I got really into [[traditional music]] when I was longing to connect with my family again, and that led to trying to build up a repertoire that my grandfather was familiar with, the classic [[old-time music|old-time]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tunes.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/ "Adrienne Young's Activism Keeps Her In Tune"] by Eric R. Danton, Courant Rock Critic, August 17, 2007 [[Hartford Courant]].</ref>}}

Young began gaining attention with her 2003 win in the Chris Austin songwriting contest at [[MerleFest]] for "Sadie's Song".  Co-written with [[Mark D. Sanders]], the song is a re-telling of the murderous bluegrass standard "[[Little Sadie]]" told from the victim's point of view.

== Recordings ==
"[[Little Sadie]]" featured prominently on her first [[CD]], ''[[Plow to the End of the Row]]'', produced with another [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based musician, [[Will Kimbrough]], and released on her own [[AddieBelle]] [[record label]].  (The label takes its name from a nickname Young was given while working as a tour guide at Nashville's [[Belle Meade Mansion]].)  The [[CD]], which includes a packet of wildflower seeds along with artwork based on the ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Album Package.

An early version of ''Plow to the End of the Row'', released in 2003, has become a sought-after collectible.  That version included several tracks with Young backed by [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] and was a top pick for 2003 Debut Artist by the Freeform American Roots DJ Chart.  The nationally-released version, featuring different sequencing, new tracks, and re-recorded versions of several songs, was released on April 13, 2004, one day before an interview with Young aired on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''.  The [[Americana Music Association]] included Young and her band in their nominees for Emerging Artist of the Year, and the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' named "Home Remedy" as Best Country Single of the year.  The CD went on to place at or near the top of numerous "best of" lists for the year and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Young "the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] music find of the year."

Young and her band Little Sadie (at the time, Tyler Grant on guitar, Clayton Campbell on fiddle and mandolin, Amanda Kowalski on bass, and Steven Sandifer on percussion) toured extensively across the U.S. and in England.  The members of the band left to pursue other projects prior to the recording of Young's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]''.

That disc, released on June 28, 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Benjamin Franklin#Thirteen Virtues|Thirteen Virtues]]''.  A copy of Franklin's pamphlet is included with the CD.  Will Kimbrough co-produced the CD and co-wrote several tracks.  Alongside original songs and traditional tunes, the disc featured a cover of the [[Grateful Dead]] song "Brokedown Palace".  Young's AddieBelle label struck a distribution deal with [[Ryko Records]] which insured that her music got placed in more record stores.  She also continued to receive support from [[public radio]] and was invited to appear on ''[[World Cafe (radio program)|World Cafe]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', and ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''.  With a new incarnation of Little Sadie (fiddler and banjoist Eric Merrill, guitarist Hans Holzen, bassist Kyle Kegerreis, and percussionist Eric Platz), Young toured even more extensively in 2005.

''The Art of Virtue'' placed third in [[Amazon.com]]'s list of the best folk recordings of the year.  Young was invited to sing in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on January 17, 2006, as part of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday celebration.

In May 2006, Young took her band to [[Levon Helm]]'s studio in [[Woodstock, New York]] to record tracks for a third album, titled ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]],'' which was released May 22, 2007.

== Social and environmental action ==
Young's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' released in 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''Thirteen Virtues'' and included copy of Franklin's pamphlet inside.  The title track addressed issues that Young found herself pondering after the 2004 re-election of [[George W. Bush]], specifically how the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had leveraged the theme of [[morality]] as a [[Political campaign|campaign]] tool.  As she said at the time:

{{blockquote|There seems to be a growing passion, collectively and individually, to understand the foundation of our American culture and how we've turned from that. Personally, it steered me back toward a time when our country was rooted in agrarian ideals and words were powerful enough to begin a new world.  Ben Franklin had such a practical approach toward nurturing virtue, the first point being nobody's perfect.}}

Since 2004 Young has been a spokeswoman for the [[FoodRoutes Network]], which aims to aid organizations in rebuilding local, community-based food systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://girlcooksworld.com/|title=Girl Cooks World - Global Cuisine, Cooking Tips, Must-haves & Ideas|website=Girlcooksworld.com|access-date=20 April 2023}}</ref>  Young used the release of the [[CD]] ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' to call attention to her involvement with the FoodRoutes Network, a non-profit organization that promotes [[sustainable agriculture]] and connects consumers with local farmers who are willing to sell direct.  ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' furthers her involvement in this movement with lyrics and songs directly addressing the issue.

<blockquote>This wasn't the first time she mixed her farm action fever with artistic output: ''Plow to the End of the Row'', her 2004 debut CD, came with a packet of seeds enclosed (and was nominated for the packaging design Grammy).</blockquote>

Young advocates locally-grown and [[sustainable agriculture]]. A portion of each record sold of ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' goes to the Save A Seed fund, which she created with nonprofit organizations the [[FoodRoutes Network]] and the [[American Community Gardening Association]]. The money will provide non-genetically modified seeds to community gardens across North America.

Young has toured with help from the organization Buy Fresh Buy Local and each of the 49 FoodRoutes chapters. Along with her performances, each tour stop offered [[sustainable living]] workshops with local sponsors in each community. "Preserving cultural genetics and agricultural heritage is the key to true security and self-reliance", she says.

Young says her music has influenced her activism because she feels at peace in nature and wants to communicate those feelings through her music.

As of 2010, Adrienne Young has hosted and organized the Backyard Revolution, a group of people sharing and demonstrating unique skills of the past and present to help educate people in self sustainability.  The Backyard Revolution was present at Floyd Fest 9 (2010) and the Heritage Harvest Festival at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. Demonstrations included: Backyard dairy cow (cow included), hide tanning and bow drill fire-making, home fermentation, historic log cabin construction, arrow fletching, soap making, primitive cooking, edible and medicinal wild plants, and more. See www.backyardrevolution.com for more information.

== Sound and style ==
Her music, created with various incarnations of her band Little Sadie, blends elements of [[bluegrass music|Bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[old-time music]], and [[American folk music]] with a pop sensibility.

{{blockquote|Young's bluegrass chops come through clearly and there's more than enough high-spirited music to get you up and dancing or clapping along, and more than enough substance to keep you reflecting on the lyrics long after the music's done, too.<ref>[http://www.dirtylinen.com review of ''Room to Grow''] August/September 2007 [[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]].</ref>|review of "Room to Grow"|''[[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]]''}}

<blockquote>. . tightly crafted songs that, like the feel of her home and the flow of her conversation, infuse her love for American tradition with high contemporary energy. Young's vocals mirror weariness and hope on 'Natural Bridge,' cross intimate valleys and climb the emotional peaks of 'Room Enough To Grow,' simmer on the stone-country burner "High Flyin’ Dream", yearn to go wherever the current takes her on 'River and a Dirt Road.'<ref name="adrienneyoung.com"/></blockquote>

'''Alabama''' is an American [[country music]] band formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]], in 1969. The band was founded by [[Randy Owen]] ([[lead vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]]) and his cousin Teddy Gentry ([[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]). They were soon joined by another cousin, [[Jeff Cook]] ([[lead guitar]], [[fiddle]], and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the [[Southeast United States|Southeast]] bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by [[RCA Records]] for a recording deal.

Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, when the band had 27 country No. 1 hits, seven multi-platinum albums, and received numerous major awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, "[[Tennessee River (song)|Tennessee River]]", began a streak of 21 country No. 1 singles, including "[[Love in the First Degree (Alabama song)|Love in the First Degree]]" (1981), "[[Mountain Music (song)|Mountain Music]]" (1982), "[[Dixieland Delight]]" (1983), "[[If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)]]" (1984) and "[[Song of the South (song)|Song of the South]]" (1988). The band's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to produce hit singles and multi-platinum albums. Alabama disbanded in 2004 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and has continued to record and tour worldwide.

The band's blend of traditional [[country music]] and [[Southern rock]] combined with elements of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music]] gave it a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] appeal that helped lead to their success. They also [[concert|toured]] extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and sets inspired by [[rock concert]]s into their shows. The band has over 41 number-one country records on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to their credit and have sold over 75&nbsp;million records, making them the [[List of best-selling music artists|most successful band in country music history]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|title=Teddy Gentry of the group Alabama will sing his songs and tell stories behind them at Samford University|newspaper=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=October 3, 2014|first=Cary|last=Estes|access-date=December 17, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217075942/http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|archive-date=December 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/07/26/alabama-southern-drawl-first-album--14-years/30411243/|title=After 14 years, Alabama is back with 'Southern Drawl'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 27, 2015|access-date=December 20, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052347/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/07/26/alabama-southern-drawl-first-album--14-years/30411243/|archive-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band and wrote that "It's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=6}}

Alabama was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2019 and was awarded the first-ever Life Time Achievement Award from this institution.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Inductees |url=https://www.musicianshalloffame.com/inductees-2019/ |website=Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref>

==History==

===1969–1979: Formation and early years===
[[Image:FortPayneAir.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alabama formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]] (seen here in 1999).]]
Alabama was formed by guitarists Randy Owen and Jeff Cook, and bassist Teddy Gentry, three cousins born and raised near Fort Payne, Alabama, an area with strong country music roots.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Owen and Gentry grew up on separate [[cotton]] farms on [[Lookout Mountain]] (a plateau that stretches across northeastern Alabama, through northwest Georgia and into Tennessee), learning guitar together and singing in church before the age of six.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Gentry and Owen played in numerous groups during the 1960s, ranging from [[pop music|pop]] to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]].{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Cook joined the band in 1969 forming the group Young Country, which first jammed together around Christmas.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Cook also played in numerous other bands and was a [[rock and roll]] [[disc jockey]].{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} The three cousins all shared vocal duties, with another cousin, drummer Jackie Owen, completing the group's first lineup.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The band's first performance was at a high school talent contest (playing a [[Merle Haggard]] song), for which they won first prize and tickets to the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name="usatoday"/>{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Despite this, all were too busy with prior commitments to pursue music: Owen still in high school, Cook working for [[Western Electric]], and Gentry laying carpets full-time.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The band grew further inactive when Cook and Owen went to college.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}}

The group became a professional band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} During this time, the group accepted a position playing at the now-defunct Canyon Land theme park near Fort Payne.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The park would bring in established stars, such as [[Jerry Wallace]], [[Bobby Bare]], and [[Narvel Felts]], and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} After a while, with opportunities for the band slow to materialize, a discouraged Cook took a government job in [[Anniston, Alabama]].

The group sent out demo tapes to record companies but received few responses until executives at [[GRT Records]] signed the band to a one-record contract,{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} issuing their debut single, "I Wanna Be with You Tonight", in 1977.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} GRT was more interested in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to The Alabama Band, later shortened to just Alabama.<ref name="billboard1"/>{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}} The song only reached number 78 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts,<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|pages=19–20|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Following self-recorded efforts ''Wildcountry'' (1976) and ''Deuces Wild'' (1977), ''Alabama Band No. 3'' (1979) became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single "[[I Wanna Come Over]]", and they sent hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} It received the attention of [[Dallas]]-based MDJ Records, who signed the band.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} "I Wanna Come Over", became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the ''Billboard'' country chart.<ref name="billboard3"/>

==Musical style and influences==
Alabama's music mixes country, rock, and pop, particularly evident in their musical concept: the band was one of the first country bands to achieve significant airplay.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Despite their influences from other genres, the band was most inspired by country music, which is most evident in their "harmonies, songwriting, and approach."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that the band is "indebted to country, particularly the [[Bakersfield sound]] of [[Merle Haggard]], and the sound of [[country pop|Nashville pop]]."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} The band echoed its country upbringing in one of its first trade articles: "We're country first and crossover second. If crossovers come, that's great, but we'd rather have a No. 1. country song than be lost in the middle of both country and pop charts," said Owen.<ref name=billboard2>{{cite magazine| last =Wells| first =Robyn| date =December 13, 1980| title =Alabama Makes Its Mark| magazine =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| volume =92| issue = 50| publisher =[[Prometheus Global Media]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0006-2510}}</ref>

By the mid-1980s, the band increasingly moved toward a general [[pop-rock]] sound, "going for splashier productions with a more heavily amplified sound."<ref name=BiographicalDictionary>Carlin, Richard. (2002). ''Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary''. [[London]]: [[Routledge]], 540 pp. First edition, 2002.</ref> Alabama's lyrics often centered on their homeland. Their first hit single, "Tennessee River", recounts being "born across the river in the mountains I call home," while "Dixieland Delight" chronicles cruising down a rural Tennessee [[Byway (road)|byway]].<ref name="tenn"/>

===Awards===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Alabama}}
Alabama is the most awarded band in the history of country music, with over 200 awards from a variety of organizations.<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1981, Alabama won both the Vocal Group of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year honors from the CMAs. It also won the ACM's Vocal Group of the Year award, and ''Billboard''{{'s}} New Group of the Year honors. The group won the CMA's prestigious Entertainer of the Year award for three consecutive years (1982–84), and the ACM's Entertainer of the Year award five times (1982–86).<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1989, Alabama was named Artist of the Decade by the ACM.

==Legacy==

===Impact===
Alabama has been credited with "substantially broadening country's audience while becoming one of the most popular acts in American musical history" by Michael McCall of ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}} The band was notable for its three-person lead (as "most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band"), their collective hair length and facial hair (which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier), and their prominent electric bass and drums.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups, and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songs.<ref name="tenn"/> Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience, although their clean-cut image appealed to the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], older country audience as well.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> Kurt Wolff described the band's appeal: "They're just rebel enough for the young folks, but their parents also dig the boys' pretty harmonies, sentimental soft spots, and old-fashioned family values."<ref name=wolff>Wolff, Kurt. (2000). ''Country Music: The Rough Guide''. Rough Guides, 608 pp. First edition, 2000.</ref> Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne, and also raised awareness for environmental issues.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}}

The band's incorporation of rock and roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as [[Restless Heart]], [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], [[Diamond Rio]], [[Lonestar]], [[Ricochet (band)|Ricochet]], and [[the Mavericks]].{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}<ref name="billboard1"/> According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', the group's diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had it not been for Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}} Prior to Alabama's unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}}

Despite their successes, Alabama's career was loathed by music critics of the day, citing the "vacuous songs and watered-down, middle-of-the-road arrangements" that blurred lines between country and pop.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' once argued the band "render[s] country music all but indistinguishable from pop" and thus "trivializes some of country's most hallowed traditions."{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=8}} Indeed, reviewers such as Wolff consider the band's "overriding problem" their calculated sound, which leads many contemporary music critics to label the band mediocre.<ref name="wolff"/>

===Philanthropy===
Beginning in 1982 and continuing until 1997, Alabama sponsored the June Jam, a music festival in Fort Payne, which at its peak drew 60,000 fans and raised millions for local charities.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} The group also held "Fan Appreciation Days", weekend events that included a golf tournament and a songwriters concert that raised money for charities in Fort Payne.<ref name="billboard1"/> Owen spearheaded "Country Cares for Kids", an annual country [[Telethon|radiothon]] that raised over $70&nbsp;million for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name="billboard1"/>

In 1994, Jackson left his management company, Ten Ten Management, which had overseen his career up to that point, and switched to Gary Overton.<ref>Lichtman, Irv (March 5, 1994), "Alan Jackson switches managers".

An additional track from the album, a cover of [[Rodney Crowell]]'s "[[Song for the Life]]", made number six.

===Mid-to-late 1990s===
''[[The Greatest Hits Collection (Alan Jackson album)|The Greatest Hits Collection]]'' was released on October 24, 1995. The disc contained 17 hits, two newly recorded songs ("[[I'll Try]]" and "[[Tall, Tall Trees]]"), and the song "[[Home (Alan Jackson song)|Home]]" from ''Here in the Real World'' that had never been released as a single.<ref>Price, Deborah Evans (September 16, 1995), [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=afh&AN=9509295833&loginpage=Login.asp&site=ehost-live "20, count `em, 20 Jackson hits"]. ''Billboard''. '''107''' (37):32.</ref> These first two songs both made number one. ''[[Everything I Love (Alan Jackson album)|Everything I Love]]'' followed in 1996. Its first single, the [[Tom T. Hall]]-penned "[[Little Bitty]]", took Jackson to the top of the charts in late 1996. The album also included the number one hit "[[There Goes]]" and a number two cover of [[Charly McClain]]'s 1980 single "[[Who's Cheatin' Who]]". The album's fifth single was "[[A House with No Curtains]]", which became his first release since 1989 to miss the top 10.<ref name="whitburn" />

1998's ''[[High Mileage]]'' was led off by the number four "[[I'll Go On Loving You]]". After it came the album's only number one hit, "[[Right on the Money]]", co-written by [[Phil Vassar]] and [[Charlie Black]]. With Jackson's release of ''[[Under the Influence (Alan Jackson album)|Under the Influence]]'' in 1999, he took the double risk on an album of covers of country classics while retaining a traditional sound when a [[rock music|rock]]- and [[pop music|pop]]-tinged sound dominated country radio.<ref>Flippo, Chet (September 25, 1999), "Jackson returns to roots with traditional set; Arista/Nashville seeks sound's revival".

===2000s===

Due to a shift in the sound of country music towards a more [[pop music|pop]] sound in the 1990s and 2000s, he and [[George Strait]] criticized the state of country music in the song "[[Murder on Music Row]]". The song sparked debate in the country music community about whether "traditional" country music was actually dead or not.<ref>Price, Deborah Evans (May 6, 2000), "Is There `Murder On Music Row'? Debate Continues". ''Billboard''. '''112''' (19):36.</ref>  Despite the fact that the song was not officially released as a single, it became the highest-charting nonseasonal album cut (not available in any retail single configuration or released as a promotional single to radio during a chart run) to appear on Hot Country Singles & Tracks in the Broadcast Data Systems era, beating the record previously held by Garth Brooks' "Belleau Wood."  The duo were invited to open the 2000 Academy of Country Music Awards (ACMAs) with a performance of the tune.<ref>Jessen, Wade (April 29, 2000), "COUNTRY CORNER". ''Billboard''. '''112''' (18):60</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented on Jackson's style remarking, "If [[Garth Brooks|Garth]] and [[Shania Twain|Shania]] have raised the bar for country concerts with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]-style production and endless costume changes, then Alan Jackson is doing his best to return the bar to a more human level."<ref>Boenlert, Eric (March 2, 2000), "Performance". [[Rolling Stone]]. (835):44</ref> After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Jackson released "[[Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)]]" as a tribute to those killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The country/soft rock song became a hit single and briefly propelled him into the mainstream spotlight; Jackson had debuted the song at the 2001 CMA Awards and his performance was generally considered the highlight of the show. Jackson's website crashed the next day from server requests.<ref>Bessman, Jim (November 24, 2001), "Words & Music". ''Billboard''. '''113''' (47):36.</ref> The song came to Jackson suddenly, and had not been scheduled for any official release, but the live performance began receiving radio airplay and was soon released as a single. It was included on his 2002 album [[Drive (Alan Jackson album)|''Drive'']], both the live version from his CMA performance, and a radio version.

Jackson released his second Christmas album (after ''[[Honky Tonk Christmas]]'' in 1993), titled ''Let It Be Christmas'' on October 22, 2002.<ref>Stark, Phyllis (September 7, 2002), "Nashville Scene". ''Billboard''. '''114''' (36):29</ref> Jeannie Kendall contacted Jackson to do a duet, and he suggested the song "Timeless and True Love"; the song appeared on her first solo album, released in 2003.<ref>Price, Deborah Evans (March 1, 2003), "Jeannie Kendall Makes Her Solo Debut On Rounder". ''Billboard''. '''115''' (9):33.</ref> In early 2006, Jackson released his first [[gospel music]] album entitled ''[[Precious Memories (Alan Jackson album)|Precious Memories]]''. He put together the album at the request of his mother, who enjoyed religious music. Jackson considered this album a "side project" and nothing too official, but it was ultimately treated as such. More than 1.8 million units were eventually sold.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Just a few months later, Jackson released his next album, ''[[Like Red on a Rose]]''. Originally intended to be a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] album, ''Like Red on a Rose'' had a different producer and sound. [[Keith Stegall]] was notably absent from this album and, instead, [[Alison Krauss]] took over the producing reins. Unlike Jackson's previous albums, the album abandoned Jackson's typical neotraditional country style and instead, went for a [[soft rock]]/[[adult contemporary]] sound. This move proved controversial for his fans, who accused him of abandoning his signature style in order to go for a more commercial pop route. Although critically acclaimed, the album was considered a commercial disappointment for the singer. For his next album, he went back to his country roots. ''[[Good Time (Alan Jackson album)|Good Time]]'' was released on March 4, 2008. The album's first single, "[[Small Town Southern Man]]", was released to radio on November 19, 2007. "[[Country Boy (Alan Jackson song)|Country Boy]]", "[[Good Time (Alan Jackson song)|Good Time]]", "[[Sissy's Song]]" and "[[I Still Like Bologna]]", were also released as singles. "Sissy's Song" is dedicated to a longtime friend of the Jackson family (Leslie "Sissy" Fitzgerald) who worked in their house every day. Fitzgerald was killed in a motorcycle accident in mid-2007.

His sixteenth studio album,  ''[[Freight Train (album)|Freight Train]]'', was released on March 30, 2010. The first single was "[[It's Just That Way]]", which debuted at No.&nbsp;50 in January 2010. "[[Hard Hat and a Hammer]]" is the album's second single, released in May 2010. On November 23, 2010, Jackson released another greatest-hits package, entitled ''[[34 Number Ones]]'', which features a cover of the [[Johnny Cash]] hit "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", as well as the duet with [[Zac Brown Band]], "[[As She's Walking Away]]". On January 20, 2011, [[Sony Music Nashville]] announced that Jackson and his Sony-owned record label, [[Arista Nashville]], had parted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-country-superstar-alan-jackson-sony-to-split-2011jan20-story.html|title=Country superstar Alan Jackson, Sony to split - The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=December 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206191546/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-country-superstar-alan-jackson-sony-to-split-2011jan20-story.html|access-date=May 15, 2021|archive-date=December 6, 2019}}</ref> In March of that year, Jackson announced his new deal with Capitol's [[Capitol Records Nashville|EMI Records Nashville]].

In 2012, Jackson released the album ''[[Thirty Miles West]]''. Three singles were released from the album: "[[Long Way to Go (Alan Jackson song)|Long Way to Go]]", "[[So You Don't Have to Love Me Anymore]]" and "[[You Go Your Way (Alan Jackson song)|You Go Your Way]]". None of the singles reached the top 20. A tour in 2013 supported the album. Jackson released his second gospel album, ''[[Precious Memories Volume II]]'', on March 26, 2013. Later that same year, Jackson released his first (and so far, only) bluegrass album, simply titled ''[[The Bluegrass Album (Alan Jackson album)|The Bluegrass Album]]''. Two singles were released from the album: "Blue Ridge Mountain Song" and "Blacktop". The album eventually peaked at no. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Bluegrass Albums]] chart and no. 3 on the country chart. In 2014, Jackson recorded the opening credits song, "A Million Ways to Die", for the film ''[[A Million Ways to Die in the West]]'', co-writing the song with [[Seth MacFarlane]] and [[Joel McNeely]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Listen-Title-Track-Seth-MacFarlane-Million-Ways-Die-West-42776.html |title=Listen To The Title Track For Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways To Die In The West |publisher=Cinema Blend |access-date=April 30, 2014|date=2014-04-29 }}</ref>

Jones has been mentioned in songs such as "[[Don't Rock the Jukebox (song)|Don't Rock the Jukebox]]" (Jones also appeared in the video which accompanied it) and "Murder on Music Row." The song "Just Playin' Possum" is dedicated to Jones and talks of how Alan only wants to lie low and play possum (with "possum" referring to George Jones). Jones can also be seen in the video for "Good Time." In 2008, Jones was a surprise guest at Jackson's "CMT Giants" ceremony, where he thanked Jackson for his friendship. He's also close friends with [[George Strait]], who sang "Murder on Music Row" with him. Besides his associations with big stars, Jackson maintains his connections to his roots and old friends.<ref name="Tyler Moreland 2008">Tyler Moreland, March 8, 2008, ''Times-Herald", Community Edition, "Highway Renamed"</ref>

At [[George Jones]]' funeral service, on May 2, 2013, Jackson performed one of Jones' classics, "[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]]", at the close of the service at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. An avid classic car collector, Jackson's collection includes an [[Amphicar]], a 1968 [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT 500 KR]] Convertible and a 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] SS 396, among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legendarycollectorcars.com/car-museums/car-museums-specific-makes/alan-jackson-car-collection/|title=Alan Jackson Car Collection|website=Legendarycollectorcars.com|date=August 17, 2009 |access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

In a 2021 appearance on ''The Today Show'', Jackson announced he had [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]] (CMT), stating "...it's been affecting me for years. And it's getting more and more obvious. And I know I'm stumbling around on stage. And now I'm having a little trouble balancing, even in front of the microphone, and so I just feel very uncomfortable."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Breen|first=Kerry|date=September 28, 2021|title=Country star Alan Jackson reveals balance issues are related to health condition|url=https://www.today.com/health/country-star-alan-jackson-announces-cmt-diagnosis-today-t232178|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-17|website=TODAY.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928123446/https://www.today.com/health/country-star-alan-jackson-announces-cmt-diagnosis-today-t232178 |archive-date=September 28, 2021 }}</ref>

===Music videos===
Krauss did not think she would make music videos at the beginning of her career. After recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has continued to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists. [[Dan Tyminski]] has noted that the [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|video for ''Thriller'']] was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions to the [[music video director|director]] of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos that band members have enjoyed. The director for a video to "If I Didn't Know Any Better" from ''Lonely Runs Both Ways'', for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with [[Def Leppard]] and, she wondered, what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many&nbsp;– including for "[[The Lucky One (Alison Krauss song)|The Lucky One]]", "Restless", "Goodbye is All We Have", "New Favorite", and "If I Didn't Know Any Better" – follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.<ref name="gacvideo" /><ref name="gacinterview">[http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_ngt/episode/0,,GAC_26155_44020,00.html Interview with Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski] on ''GAC Nights''{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

At the [[76th Academy Awards]] in February 2004, where she performed two nominated songs from the ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' soundtrack, Krauss was chosen by Hollywood shoe designer [[Stuart Weitzman]] to wear a pair of $2 million 'Cinderella' sandals with 4½ inch clear glass stiletto heels and two straps adorned with 565 Kwiat diamonds set in platinum. Feeling like a rather unglamorous choice, Krauss said, "When I first heard, I was like, 'What were they thinking?' I have the worst feet of anybody who will be there that night!" In addition to the fairy-tale-inspired shoes, Weitzman outfitted Krauss with a [[Palm Trēo]] 600 smartphone, bejeweled with 3,000 clear-and-topaz-colored [[Swarovski]] crystals. The shoes were returned, but Krauss kept the crystal-covered phone. Weitzman chose Krauss to show off his fashions at the urging of his daughters, who are fans of Krauss' music.<ref>Lee, Lisa.

She grew up in [[Arkansas]] and she was drawn to various types of music from a young age. She also developed a passion for writing songs and later moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pursue a music career.

Between 2006 and 2011, McBryde released a pair of self-released albums. Her 2016 [[extended play]] (EP) titled ''Jalopies & Expensive Guitars'' drew attention from country artist [[Eric Church]]. His support helped her gain a country music recording contract with [[Warner Music Nashville]]. In 2017, the label released her debut [[Single (music)|single]] "[[A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega]]". The song was followed by her corresponding studio release ''[[Girl Going Nowhere]]'' (2018). Both the album and the single received critical acclaim and led to recognition from several music associations. It was followed by 2020's ''[[Never Will]]'', which was also met with critical acclaim. Its lead single "[[One Night Standards]]" reached the top 20 of the American country songs chart and topped the Canadian country survey.

McBryde has received one [[Grammy Award]] from six nominations, one [[Country Music Association Award]], three [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Awards|Daytime Emmy]].

'''Aubrey E. Haynie'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/903111061 |title=BREAKDOWN |website=ASCAP |publisher=American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers |access-date=March 17, 2023}}</ref> (born March 27, 1974) is an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] musician who plays the [[fiddle]] and [[mandolin]]. In his career, he has recorded three studio albums for the [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] label, all three of which contained mostly songs that he wrote himself. He also holds several credits as a session fiddler and mandolinist.

==Biography==

===Early influences===
When Haynie was nine, he began taking fiddle lessons from his grandmother's cousin, a man named Ted Locke.  He studied the fiddle, for two years, after which he took up the mandolin. He became exceedingly good at both, and within two years he joined a bluegrass band named the Bluegrass Parlor Band. While he was traveling, he got a chance to meet [[Chubby Wise]], a self-styled "original" [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]], on many occasions. These opportunities enriched his sense of music, and were a great inspiration to him in his younger years.  Another major influence on Haynie's music was that of Kenny Baker, whose fiddle albums were some of his favorites. Those familiar with Baker's fiddle style might recognize similarities in Haynie's sound.

In 1990, at age 16, attending the [[Florida]] fiddling championships, and competing, Haynie won first place in the contemporary division for the second time, playing Wild Fiddler's Rag and [[Les Patineurs (waltz)|Skater's Waltz]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Jeff |last = Klinkenberg |title = FIT AS A FIDDLE Series: DATELINE FLORIDA |work = St. Petersburg Times |date = 1990-06-03}}</ref>

In August 1996 Haynie lost two [[violins]] and a [[Violin bow|bow]], when a lightning-induced fire burnt [[Tim Austin (musician)|Tim Austin]]'s [[Doobie Shea Records|Doobie Shea Studios]] to the ground.<ref>{{cite news |first = Mark |last = Morrison |title = Bluegrass Studio up in Flames |work = Roanoke Times & World News |date = 1996-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Madelyn |author-link=Madelyn Rosenberg |date=1997-07-30 |title=A Year After a Fire at the Doobie Shea Studios, Tim Austin has the Music Miked and Tapes Humming the Bands Play On... |work=Roanoke Times & World News}}</ref>

In 2004 Haynie won the fiddle category at the 39th Annual [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards.<ref>{{cite news |title = Off-Camera Awards Winners Announced for the 39th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards Live Awards Telecast to Be Broadcast From Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas Wednesday, May 26th at 8:00 PM ET/PT on CBS Television Network |publisher = PR Newswire (U.S.) |date = 2004-05-06}}</ref>

Haynie has been seen appearing in informal music performances under other musicians' headlines, and earned a living as a [[session musician]].

Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three country rock bands: [[Hearts & Flowers]], [[Dillard & Clark]], and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]]. He is a multi-instrumentalist ([[guitar]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[steel guitar]], [[dobro]]) coming from a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles.

Leadon's music career since leaving the Eagles has been low-key, resulting in two solo albums (the first actually being a collaborative project with Michael Georgiades) with a gap of 27 years in between. Leadon has also appeared on many other artists' records as a session musician.

==Early life and musical beginnings==
<!--Leadon was born in Minneapolis, one of ten siblings, to Bernard Leadon Jr. and Ann Teresa (née Sweetser) Leadon, devout [[Roman Catholic]]s. His father was an aerospace engineer and nuclear physicist whose career moved the family around the U.S. The family enjoyed music and, at an early age, Bernie developed an interest in folk and bluegrass music. He eventually mastered the 5-string banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar.
-->
<!--As a young teen he moved with his family to San Diego, California, where he-->In San Diego, California, Leadon met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit [[the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers]]. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent, including shy, 18-year-old mandolin player [[Chris Hillman]], with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player (and future Flying Burrito Brother) Kenny Wertz, the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group, upon Wertz's joining the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in 1963.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

<!--His stint in the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers did not last long. In late 1963, his family relocated to [[Gainesville, Florida]], when his father accepted a position as Professor of [[Aerospace Engineering]] at the [[University of Florida]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Leadon attended [[Gainesville High School (Florida)|Gainesville High School]], where-->He later met <!--classmate and--> future Eagles lead guitarist [[Don Felder]], whose band, the Continentals, had just lost guitarist [[Stephen Stills]]. <!--Upon Leadon's joining the group, rechristened Maundy Quintet, they gigged locally, even sharing the bill with future Gainesville legend [[Tom Petty]] and his early band the Epics (a band that also included Bernie's brother, musician [[Tom Leadon]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}-->

A call from ex-Squirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967 to join his fledgling psychedelic country-folk group Hearts & Flowers brought Leadon to California, where he became involved with the burgeoning L.A. folk/country rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band, its second release, ''Of Horses, Kids, and Forgotten Women'', for [[Capitol Records]]. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged, the group disbanded the following year.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Dillard & Clark===
By late 1968, Leadon had befriended bluegrass/banjo legend [[Doug Dillard]], late of [[the Dillards]]. While staying with Dillard, informal jam sessions with songwriter and ex-[[Byrds]] member [[Gene Clark]] began to take shape, and morphed into what eventually became the country-rock band Dillard & Clark. In 1968, the group recorded ''[[The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]]'', featuring Leadon's backing vocals and multi-instrumental work. The album included several compositions co-written with Clark, most notably the future Eagles staple (and somewhat of a signature song for Leadon) from their debut album, "Train Leaves Here This Morning".

===The Flying Burrito Brothers===
[[File:FlyingBurritos1970.jpg|thumb|Flying Burrito Brothers (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], [[Chris Hillman]], [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]], Bernie Leadon]]
Leadon left Dillard & Clark in 1969, eventually reconnecting with ex-Squirrel Barker (and ex-Byrd) Chris Hillman, who asked him to join the Flying Burrito Brothers, a fledgling country-rock band that Hillman had formed a year earlier with fellow ex-Byrd [[Gram Parsons]]. Leadon recorded two albums with the group: ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]'' and the post-Parsons LP [[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|''The Flying Burrito Bros'']].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} After the latter album's release in 1971, Leadon had tired of the band's lack of commercial success and decided to leave the band to pursue an opportunity to play with three musicians he had worked with while moonlighting in [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backing band that summer, forming the Eagles.

==Eagles==

Leadon was the last original member to join the Eagles,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} a band initially formed by guitarist/singer [[Glenn Frey]], drummer/singer [[Don Henley]], and former [[Poco (band)|Poco]] bassist/singer [[Randy Meisner]]. Leadon is often credited with helping shape the band's early country-rock sound, bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country, bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group. Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were [[electric guitar]], [[B-Bender]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[dobro]] and [[pedal steel guitar]].

Upon the release of their debut album, [[Eagles (album)|''Eagles'']], the group met with near instant success, due largely to the strength of their hit singles "[[Take It Easy]]", "[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]" and "[[Witchy Woman]]" (co-written by Leadon and Henley), all of which highlighted Leadon's multi-instrumental talent and harmony vocals. Their follow-up, [[Desperado (Eagles album)|''Desperado'']], was another strong country-rock venture highlighted by the classics "[[Tequila Sunrise (Eagles song)|Tequila Sunrise]]" and the [[Desperado (Eagles song)|title track]]. Leadon had a prominent role on the album but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales. As a result, the band attempted to distance itself from the "[[country rock]]" label for their third album ''[[On the Border]]''. In doing so, Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend, guitarist [[Don Felder]], to the band. The result was the guitar-heavy top 40 hit "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]". The album also included "My Man", Leadon's touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend [[Gram Parsons]], who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at [[Joshua Tree National Park|Joshua Tree National Monument]] in southeastern California.

With the wild success of ''[[On the Border]]'' and its follow-up smash, ''[[One of These Nights]]'', tension within the band grew with some sources saying Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the band's direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass toward album-oriented stadium rock. He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Frey's head.<ref>Eliot, Marc (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC ''To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles'']{{Dead link|date=October 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 131. Da Capo Press.</ref> He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring, recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band.

Upon Leadon's departure, [[Asylum Records]] released ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'', which highlighted the band's Leadon years and went on to become the best-selling album in United States history, with sales in excess of 38 million units. He was replaced by former [[James Gang]] guitarist and singer [[Joe Walsh]].

Although it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll, Leadon denies it and said in 2013, "That's an oversimplification, it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock. That's just not the case. I didn't just play [[Fender Telecaster]]. I played a [[Gibson Les Paul]] and I enjoyed [[rock & roll]]. That's evident from the early albums."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eagles-tour-will-feature-founding-guitarist-bernie-leadon-20130705 |title=Eagles Tour: Guitarist Bernie Leadon Will Reunite |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=July 5, 2013 |access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref>

==Later career==
[[File:Eagles in concert September 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|History of the Eagles tour, 2014. Leadon (second from left) joined the tour.]]
Upon leaving the Eagles, Leadon retreated from the limelight, only to resurface in 1977 with musician friend Michael Georgiades for the album, ''Natural Progressions'' (credited to "The Bernie Leadon-Michael Georgiades Band"), featuring Leadon and Georgiades on guitars and alternating lead vocals, along with Bryan Garofalo on bass, Dave Kemper on drums, and Steve Goldstein on keyboard.

In 1985, he recorded an album of bluegrass and gospel favorites under the name Ever Call Ready, featuring Chris Hillman and [[Al Perkins]]. He also had a short stint with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] in the late 1980s.

In 1993, he became a member of [[Run C&W]], a novelty group singing Motown hits "bluegrass style", recording two albums for [[MCA Records]].

In 1998, Leadon reunited with the Eagles in New York City for the band's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. All seven current and former Eagles members performed together on "Take It Easy" and "[[Hotel California]]".

In 2004, he released his second solo effort in 27 years (and his first under solely his name), ''Mirror''.

Leadon toured with the Eagles from 2013 through 2015 during their [[History of the Eagles – Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]]<ref name="Miami">{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/review-eagles-bring-40-year-history-tour-and-taste-california-miami-s-americanairlines-arena-article|title=Review: Eagles bring 40-year 'History' Tour and taste of California to Miami's AmericanAirlines Arena|first=Howard|last=Cohen|work=[[Miami.com]]|date=November 23, 2013|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_25025439/review-eagles-fly-through-history-lesson|title=Review: Eagles fly through history lesson|first=Jim|last=Harrington|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=January 30, 2014|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> In 2015, Leadon appeared on producer [[Ethan Johns]]' third solo album, ''[[Silver Liner]]''.

In February 2016, Leadon appeared at the [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony with [[Jackson Browne]] and the surviving Eagles members - Don Henley, Joe Walsh, and [[Timothy B. Schmit]] - performing "Take it Easy", in tribute to [[Glenn Frey]] who had died a month earlier.<ref name="grammy">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/6875302/glenn-frey-eagles-tribute-grammys-2016|title=Glenn Frey Tribute at the 2016 Grammys: Jackson Browne, Don Henley and Joe Walsh Perform 'Take It Easy'|last=Rys|first=Dan|date=February 15, 2016|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=February 20, 2016}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
For a few years in the mid-1970s, Leadon lived in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]], a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] enclave known for its musician residents. Leadon's house-plus-recording-studio had previously been owned by singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]], and was the site of frequent parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhregister.com/realestate/article/Tonight-s-the-Night-to-Purchase-Neil-Young-s-12905037.php|title=Tonight's the Night to Purchase Neil Young's Former Topanga Retreat|date=May 10, 2018|website=New Haven Register}}</ref> Leadon lived with [[Patti Davis]], the daughter of conservative California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]], who was at that time campaigning for president and distancing himself from his daughter because Leadon and she were unmarried but living together. Leadon and Davis co-wrote the song "I Wish You Peace", which Leadon insisted the Eagles include on the album ''[[One of These Nights]]'', against the wishes of his bandmates.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography |first=Kitty |last=Kelley |date=2011 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=356 |isbn=9781451674767}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-problem-of-being-patti-vol-25-no-8/|title=The Problem of Being Patti|website=People}}</ref>

'''James William Anderson III''' (born November 1, 1937), known professionally as '''Bill Anderson''', is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and television host. His soft-spoken singing voice was given the nickname "Whispering Bill" by music critics and writers.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> As a songwriter, his compositions have been covered by various music artists since the late 1950s, including [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] and [[George Strait]].

Anderson was raised in [[Decatur, Georgia]], and began composing songs while in high school. While enrolled in college, he wrote the song "[[City Lights (Ray Price song)|City Lights]]", which later became a major hit for Ray Price in 1958. His songwriting led to his first recording contract with [[Decca Records]] the same year. Anderson began having major hits shortly thereafter. In 1963, he had released his most successful single in his recording career, "[[Still (Bill Anderson song)|Still]]". The song became a major country pop [[crossover music|crossover]] hit and was followed by a series of top ten hits. These songs included "[[I Love You Drops (song)|I Love You Drops]]", "[[I Get the Fever]]" and  "[[Wild Week-End]]". His songs were being notably recorded by other artists. In 1964, [[Connie Smith]] had her first major hit with his composition "[[Once a Day]]". In 1971, [[Cal Smith]] had a number one single with Anderson's "[[The Lord Knows I'm Drinking]]".

In the 1970s, Anderson continued having major hits as a recording artist as well. Songs including "[[Love Is a Sometimes Thing]]", "[[All the Lonely Women in the World]]" and "[[World of Make Believe]]" became major hits. As the decade progressed his style moved towards the polished [[countrypolitan]] genre of country music, with songs such as "[[I Can't Wait Any Longer]]". He was dropped from his record label in the early 1980s and began a brief career in television which included hosting the game shows ''[[The Better Sex]]'' and ''[[Fandango (game show)|Fandango]].'' Anderson began writing songs again in the early 1990s for the next generation of country performers. Collaborating with other writers, he wrote material that went on to become hits for [[Vince Gill]], [[George Strait]], [[Kenny Chesney]], and [[Steve Wariner]] in the next two decades.

Anderson also continued recording into the 1990s. In 1998, he released his first major label album in over a decade, entitled ''[[Fine Wine (Bill Anderson album)|Fine Wine]].'' He continued releasing music through his own TWI record label. This included projects of gospel and bluegrass material. His most recent studio album was released in 2020. In his career as both a writer and performer, he has received awards from the [[Academy of Country Music]], [[Country Music Association]], [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Anderson was born James William Anderson III to Elizabeth and James William Anderson Jr. in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. He was the oldest of two children. His sister, Elizabeth Anderson, was born two years after. Anderson's father was an [[insurance broker|insurance agent]] while his mother was a homemaker. He spent his early childhood with his family in Columbia.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=9}} The family moved to his grandparents' home in [[Griffin, Georgia]], while Anderson was in the third grade. Shortly afterward, the family relocated into their own home in [[Decatur, Georgia]], where he spent the remainder of his childhood.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=15–16}} In Decatur, his father opened his own insurance agency firm, which he continued to own until his retirement. In his 2016 autobiography, Anderson described his childhood as "average", recalling that he "never went to bed hungry" even though the family did not have many material possessions.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=16–17}} 
[[File:UGASLC.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Anderson briefly attended the [[University of Georgia]] in the late 1950s, where he studied journalism.]]

In school, Anderson was active in [[4-H]] organizations and played both baseball and football.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=16}} However, he was most interested in music, having been inspired by his grandparents who played instruments.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=Ken |title=Country Music: Bill Anderson Biography |url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/bill-anderson-biography |website=[[PBS]] |access-date=August 6, 2020}}</ref> His interest grew further after watching country musicians perform on a radio station, located directly above his father's insurance company.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=17–19}} Anderson soon saved enough money to purchase his own guitar. At age ten, he wrote his first song called "Carry Me Home Texas".<ref name="PBS"/>

In high school, Anderson and his friends formed their own band and won a school talent contest. The band began performing around the local area, eventually performing on local radio as "The Avondale Playboys".{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=19–22}} Anderson's strong interest in baseball continued through high school as well. He became his high school team's pitcher and was scouted to go to the [[Chicago Cubs]] training camp. However, Anderson declined the offer after realizing that his family would be upset if he did not attend college.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=22–23}} Upon graduating high school, he enrolled at the [[University of Georgia]] and majored in [[journalism]].<ref name="PBS"/>

Anderson had dabbled with journalism before enrolling in university. While still in high school, he wrote for his school's newspaper and also obtained a job covering sports events for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]].''{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=27}} In his freshman year, he pledged the [[Kappa Sigma Fraternity]].{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=28}} He and several students formed a country band called the "Classic City Playboys" and began playing local events. He also became interested in radio station work after a DJ friend introduced him to some of the controls. "I thought I was Superman. I knew that night I had to get a job as a disc jockey", he recalled.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=32}}

Anderson graduated from college in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Anderson papers and records |url=https://sclfind.libs.uga.edu/sclfind/view?docId=ead/ms3941.xml |website=[[University of Georgia]] |access-date=24 April 2022}}</ref> During his first summer out of college, he got a job working as a rock and roll DJ at [[WGAU]] in [[Athens, Georgia]]. However, he was fired after playing country records over the air and was then hired at [[WJJC]] in [[Commerce, Georgia]]. Anderson began songwriting again after obtaining the new position. In Commerce, Anderson wrote the song "[[City Lights (Ray Price song)|City Lights]]". The song ultimately brought him to Nashville where both his songwriting and recording career began.<ref name="PBS"/>

==Recording career==
===1958–1962: Early success===
Anderson's own recording career began in 1957 after releasing two singles for the independent label, TNT. Both songs (including his own version of "City Lights") attracted little attention.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=46–47}} However, the success brought by Ray Price's version of "City Lights" led Anderson to frequent [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In the city, he brought compositions for artists and producers to record. [[Owen Bradley]] of [[Decca Records]] was impressed by Anderson's writing and decided to sign him as a recording artist to the label. Anderson officially signed with Decca in the summer of 1958.<ref name="PBS"/> His early Decca singles were entirely self-composed. Anderson's first Decca released was issued in December 1958 called "[[That's What It's Like to Be Lonesome]]".<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> The song became a major hit the following year when it climbed to the number 12 position on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="That's What It's Like to Be Lonesome" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> He followed this in 1959 with the top 20 hits "[[Ninety-Nine (song)|Ninety Nine]]" and "[[Dead or Alive (Bill Anderson song)|Dead or Alive]]".<ref name="whitburn"/>

[[File:Bill Anderson 1970.JPG|thumb|right|180px|A publicity image of Anderson from his time at Decca Records]]
In 1960, "[[The Tip of My Fingers]]" became his first top ten hit on the country chart, reaching number seven in August 1960.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="The Tip of My Fingers" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> The song was later recorded and made hits individually by [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Jean Shepard]] and [[Steve Wariner]].{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=12}} In 1961, the single "[[Po' Folks (Bill Anderson song)|Po' Folks]]" reached number nine on the ''Billboard'' country songs chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Po' Folks" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> The success of "Po' Folks" led Anderson to receive an invitation to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]] cast.

===1963–1976: "Still" and further career success===
By 1963, Anderson's recording career was expanding further. He was frequently touring and making public appearances to promote his music. Anderson was inspired to write his 1963 composition, "[[Still (Bill Anderson song)|Still]]", after encountering an ex-girlfriend while promoting a song. The same night, he wrote the lyrics to the track on an [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood typewriter]] at three o'clock in the morning.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=80}} "Still" became the biggest single of his recording career.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> In April 1963, it reached number one on the ''Billboard'' country and western songs chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Still" chart history (Country Songs) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> It also became his second single to reach the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, but was his first (and only) successful crossover hit there, reaching number eight in June 1963.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Still" chart history (Hot 100) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/hsi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> The track was also his first single to become a hit on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult contemporary (chart)|easy listening chart]], reaching number three that June.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Still" chart history (AC) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/asi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> The song's success led to the 1963 release of Anderson's [[Still (Bill Anderson album)|debut studio album of the same name]].<ref name="Still Liner Notes">{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Bill |title=''Still'' (Liner Notes and Album Information) |journal=[[Decca Records]] |date=June 17, 1963 |id=MCAC-20536}}</ref> The LP reached number ten on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums|country albums]] chart in January 1964<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Still'' chart history (Country Albums) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/clp/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> and the top 40 of the [[Billboard 200]] in late 1963.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Still'' chart history (Billboard 200) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/tlp/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref>

The success of "Still" further elevated Anderson's recording career. This included making national television appearances on shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]],'' where he performed his follow-up crossover hit "[[8×10 (song)|8×10]]". He won awards from several major music publications including ''Billboard,'' ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' and ''[[Record World|Music Reporter]].''{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=84}} He scheduled more concert engagements and made as much as $500 per gig.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=114}} His success led Decca to record and release studio albums with more frequency. These albums were also successful. His second studio LP, ''[[Bill Anderson Sings]]'' (1964), reached the top ten of the country albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Bill Anderson Sings'' chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/clp/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> His [[I Love You Drops|1966 studio release]] reached number one on the same chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''I Love You Drops'' chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bill-anderson/chart-history/clp/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref> Album releases were fueled by further hit singles, including "[[Bright Lights and Country Music (song)|Bright Lights and Country Music]]", "[[Five Little Fingers]]" and "[[Three A.M.]]"<ref name="whitburn"/> Music writers took notice of Anderson's music success as well. ''Billboard'' magazine called his 1964 album, ''[[Showcase (Bill Anderson album)|Showcase]],'' "a powerful set of performances".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Special Merit Picks |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=December 5, 1964 |volume=76 |issue=49 |page=24}}</ref> Kurt Wolff of the book ''Country Music: The Rough Guide'' credited his success to a "fairly safe and suburban" musical style.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}}

His chart hits continued through the 1960s and many of these songs were self-composed. His 1966 release, "[[I Love You Drops (song)|I Love You Drops]]", was inspired by the [[Chuck Berry]] hit "[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis Tennessee]]".{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=91}} His next self-written release also became his third number-one hit, titled "[[I Get the Fever]]".<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> He had further top ten hits with "[[Get While the Gettin's Good (song)|Get While the Gettin's Good]]" and "[[No One's Gonna Hurt You Anymore]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> During this time, Anderson formed his own touring band which he named "The Po' Boys" after his 1961 hit. The band frequently received credit on his studio albums and single releases.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=114–16}} He also started his own television program called ''The Bill Anderson Show,'' which was taped in Canada and Nashville.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=173–74}} In the mid 1960s, he began performing duets with country artist [[Jan Howard]], who was also on Decca Records.

===1977–1989: Countrypolitan shift and new changes===
By 1977, Anderson experienced several changes in his recording career. His longtime duet partner, Jan Howard, left his record label and road show. According to Howard, it was difficult to keep up with the busy touring schedule.<ref name="Jan Howard"/> She was replaced by [[Mary Lou Turner]]. In 1976, the Turner-Anderson  pairing had a number one hit with the song, "[[Sometimes (Bill Anderson song)|Sometimes]]".<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> Anderson's longtime label was renamed to [[MCA Records]] during the same time frame.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}} Changes at the label continued when his longtime producer (Owen Bradley) was replaced by [[Buddy Killen]].

In 1977, Anderson had two major hits with the uptempo "[[Head to Toe (Bill Anderson song)|Head to Toe]]" and "[[Still the One]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> The following year, Anderson had a major hit with the [[Disco music|disco]]-flavored "[[I Can't Wait Any Longer]]".

Although successful at first, Anderson's late-1970s music received negative criticism from many writers. Author Kurt Wolff criticized his new image, commenting that his music "flirted dangerously with disco beats".{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}} Eugene Chadbourne of Allmusic only gave his ''Love...& Other Sad Stories'' album 1.5 out of 5 stars.

In the mid 1980s, Anderson shifted his professional interests. He began a brief television career in California.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> However, he continued recording music sporadically during the decade.

==Songwriting career==
===1958–1979: Breakthrough in Nashville===
Anderson's writing career began during the same period as his recording career. His 1958 composition, "City Lights", ultimately led to his songwriting success. In an interview with [[Ken Burns]], Anderson recalled writing the song on a hotel roof: "I was up there one night in 1957 – I was nineteen years old – and I managed to write the 'bright array of city lights as far as I can see'", he recalled.<ref name="PBS"/> After Anderson's own version was released, it was brought to the attention of country artist [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]. It was picked up by his record label and became a number one hit on the national country charts in 1958.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}}<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

Anderson also wrote several hits for [[Connie Smith]]. He was also responsible for helping Smith sign her first recording contract.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}} Anderson had discovered Smith after hearing her perform in a talent contest near [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He helped bring her to Nashville, where she recorded several demonstration tapes that were heard by producers at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor Records]].

Released as her debut single, it spent a total of eight weeks on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart, becoming his most successful hit as a writer at that point.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=327–28}} Smith's career was further facilitated by Anderson, who wrote many of her follow-up hits such as "[[Then and Only Then]]", "[[Cincinnati, Ohio (song)|Cincinnati, Ohio]]" and "[[I Never Once Stopped Loving You (song)|I Never Once Stopped Loving You]]".<ref name="Connie Smith"/> Anderson further helped her professional career by helping her become a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and make an appearance on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]].'' "From the beginning, I liked Connie a lot personally and tried to help her", he recalled in his 2016 autobiography.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=167}}

Anderson also wrote material for pop artists during this time. In the 1960s, [[Brenda Lee]] recorded Anderson's "[[My Whole World Is Falling Down]]".{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=85–110}} The single peaked at number 24 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in August 1963.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="My Whole World Is Falling Down" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/brenda-lee/chart-history/hsi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref> Other pop artists to record Anderson's material included [[James Brown]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Dean Martin]].{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=xiii}} However, his most successful material was recorded by country artists, who continued recording his songs into the next decade.

===1980–1991: Writing shifts===
Anderson's writing and recording careers slowed down at the same time. In the early 1980s, he began writing music less frequently. Instead, he began focusing on other projects in television. "I just knew that this is what I wanted to do for my life's work, but I do remember telling people I'd stop if it wasn't working out", he said in describing his move away from writing.<ref name="BMI 1">{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Peter |title=Bill Anderson's Career Comes Full Circle |url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bill_andersons_career_comes_full_circle |website=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] |date=January 11, 2008 |access-date=August 25, 2020}}</ref> In a 2020 interview with ''American Songwriter,'' Anderson also explained that the country market was shifting towards crossover pop.

Anderson did not fully stop writing material for his own albums. On his 1983 studio release, ''Southern Fried,'' he wrote three of the record's tracks.<ref name="SF Liner Notes"/> His 1986 studio album, ''[[A Place in the Country (album)|A Place in the Country]],'' contained two tracks written (or co-written) by Anderson. However, only one album track was self-composed: the song "We May Never Pass This Way Again.' Both of these self-composed tracks were only included on the version of the album released in the United Kingdom.<ref name="UK"/> Anderson turned his writing priorities towards other directions as well. In 1989, he released his first autobiography, ''Whisperin' Bill,'' via Longstreet Press.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thanki |first1=Juli |title=Bill Anderson discusses triumphant return in new autobiography |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/02/12/bill-anderson-discusses-triumphant-return-new-autobiography/79816016/ |website=[[The Tennessean]] |access-date=25 August 2020}}</ref> It was reviewed by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' in August 1989, giving it a mostly positive response: "Despite a measure of hoopla and hyperbole ('I did it . . . I did it all . . . but it wasn't easy'), the author does justice to a powerful story", reviewers commented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nonfiction Book Review: ''Whisperin' Bill: An Autobiography'' |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-929264-24-0 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=August 25, 2020}}</ref>

===1992–present: Return to songwriting and collaborations with others===
In 1992, country artist [[Steve Wariner]] recorded Anderson's 1960 hit "The Tip of My Fingers". Released as a single, it became a top-five hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart that year and inspired Anderson to write again.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> "Steve's version of 'Tips' was some indication that words, melodies and emotions can carry across decades", he commented.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=225}} Among his next compositions was a song co-written with [[Vince Gill]] entitled "[[Which Bridge to Cross (Which Bridge to Burn)]]". The song was written in a "writing appointment", where composers make arrangements to write music and are paid by recording hours in a time clock.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=227–29}} "Which Bridge to Cross" was released as a single by Gill in 1994 and became a major hit, peaking at number four on the ''Billboard'' country chart.<ref name="whitburn"/> According to Anderson, the song's success helped him gain credibility with younger songwriters in Nashville. He began receiving phone calls from other writers and performers to set up more writing appointments.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=229}} Anderson, who was not used to writing with others, decided to make adaptations to his own songwriting style in order to collaborate. "I let a lot of young kids tell me a lot of things, and I benefited from that, greatly", he recounted.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=238}}

Anderson began co-writing more frequently during the 1990s. Wariner had another hit in 1999 with another Anderson composition titled "[[Two Teardrops]]".{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=235–36}} The song became a major hit when it reached number two on the country songs chart in June 1999.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Two Teardrops" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/steve-wariner/chart-history/csa/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref> The song was also nominated for a [[Grammy award]].{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=235–36}} During the same period, he collaborated with [[Skip Ewing]] and Debbie Moore on the song "[[Wish You Were Here (Mark Wills song)|Wish You Were Here]]".{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=237}} The song was released as a single by [[Mark Wills]] and became a number one hit on the ''Billboard'' country chart in 1999.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Wish You Were Here" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/mark-wills/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref> Anderson later commented that the song's success helped him resolve financial struggles he had battled during the decade.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=238}} He followed "Wish You Were Here" with the song "[[A Lot of Things Different]]", which was co-written with [[Dean Dillon]]. The song was written during an exchange the pair had while out to breakfast.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=255}} The song was later recorded by [[Kenny Chesney]], whose version reached number six on the country singles chart in 2003.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Kenny Chesney chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/kenny-chesney/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref>

Chesney's song was followed by a track later recorded by [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Alison Krauss]] called "[[Whiskey Lullaby]]". The tune was composed with singer-songwriter [[Jon Randall]]. After writing the song, Randall was reluctant to record a [[demo (music)|demo]] of the record to pitch to other artists. However, Anderson believed the song could be a success and its demo was then recorded at ten o'clock on a weeknight.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=264–65}} Paisley's version was released as a single in 2004 and peaked at number three on the ''Billboard'' country chart that year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Whiskey Lullaby" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/alison-krauss/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref> In 2005, "Whiskey Lullaby" won "Song of the Year" at the [[Country Music Association Awards]].<ref name="CMA Awards">{{cite web |title=Past Winners and Nominees: Bill Anderson |url=https://cmaawards.com/past-winners-and-nominees/?appSession=4T936M34H8LG4N842905B7G4KV6J31SJ27VFOB36J04U7EB1K2I6I27212F7171KJ686J7RV3TOR5DM0SO61TKT6NKV51IE8O7O25QY31N0PRH1FBRS7PXQB31K3HZ42 |website=[[Country Music Association Awards]] |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref> Anderson recalled the excitement of winning the accolade in his autobiography: "I jumped up and hugged Brad and knocked his white western hat from his head."{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=268}}

In 2006, Anderson co-wrote a song with [[Jamey Johnson]] and [[Buddy Cannon]] called "[[Give It Away (George Strait song)|Give It Away]]". The song was later cut by [[George Strait]].{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=271}} The song's concept was inspired by Johnson's divorce at the time and included a spoken narration, a device that was not popular in the country genre during the mid-2000s.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=272}} Strait's version was released as a single in 2006 and reached number one on the country chart that September.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Give It Away" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/george-strait/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref> The song later won "Song of the Year" from the CMA Awards, becoming Anderson's third accolade from the awards show in the last three years.<ref name="CMA Awards"/> Later that decade, Anderson collaborated with other writers to compose "[[Joey (Sugarland song)|Joey]]" for the country duo [[Sugarland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Story Behind the Song "Joey" |url=https://theboot.com/story-behind-the-song-joey-sugarland/ |website=The Boot |date=November 6, 2015 |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref> The single reached the top 20 of the country songs chart in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Joey" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/sugarland/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref> In 2014, Anderson co-wrote [[Mo Pitney]]'s top-30 country hit "[[Country (Mo Pitney song)|Country]]" with Pitney and Bobby Tomberlin.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mo Pitney, 'Country,' TOC Critics Pick |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/mo-pitney-country/ |website=Taste of Country |date=December 16, 2014 |access-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref>

==Other career contributions==
===Film and television===
Between 1965 and 1974, Anderson hosted his own national television series called ''The Bill Anderson Show''.<ref name="Nashville Songwriters">{{cite web |title=Bill Anderson |url=http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=126 |website=[[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] |access-date=August 27, 2020}}</ref> The program also featured Jan Howard (his duet partner) and The Po' Boys (his touring band).<ref name="Jan Howard"/> The show was first filmed in [[Windsor, Ontario]] and [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. Filming was later moved to the General Electric Broadcasting Facility in Nashville, Tennessee. Broadcasting from Nashville made traveling easier since Anderson lived in the city.<ref name="Jan Howard"/>{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=174}} On an average filming day, Anderson taped two thirty-minute shows in front of a live audience.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=174}} Around this time, he also appeared in several country music vehicle films. This included ''[[The Las Vegas Hillbillys]]'', which featured country artists [[Sonny James]] and [[Connie Smith]].<ref name="Las Vegas Hillbillys">{{cite web |title=Las Vegas Hillbillys |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/las-vegas-hillbillys/Film?oid=1053744 |website=[[Chicago Reader]] |date = October 26, 1985|access-date=August 27, 2020}}</ref> He also made appearances on several national television shows during this time, including ''[[The Today Show]].''{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=174}}

[[File:Krystal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anderson became a spokesperson for the [[Po' Folks (restaurant)|Po' Folks]] fast-food company. The company was later bought out by the [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] hamburger chain (pictured above).]]
Anderson ventured further into television in the late 1970s. Between 1977 and 1978, he and [[Sarah Purcell]] co-hosted the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] game show ''[[The Better Sex]]''.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> In 1980, he appeared on two episodes of the ABC soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'', portraying a fictionalized version of himself. In a 1980 interview, then-ABC vice president Jackie Smith called the decision "a first" for a country artist.<ref name="One Life">{{cite web |last1=Hanauer |first1=Joan |title=Soap Opry |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1980/10/19/SOAP-OPRY/3434340776000/ |website=UPI |access-date=August 27, 2020}}</ref> Also in the 1980s, Anderson hosted the program ''Backstage at the Grand Ole Opry'' and the game show ''[[Fandango (game show)|Fandango]]'', which both aired on the former [[The Nashville Network|Nashville Network]] (TNN). ''Fandango'' was brought to Anderson's attention by the program director of [[WSMV-TV|WSM TV]] in Nashville, who believed that a country music trivia show would be successful for the network.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=220}} "I've gotten into a lot of different things. I'm probably in the public eye more right now than I've ever been because of the things that I do on television", he said in 1988.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lynn |first1=Linda |title=Career Full of Opportunities For "Fandango's' Bill Anderson |url=https://oklahoman.com/article/2247737/career-full-of-opportunities-for-fandangos-bill-anderson |access-date=August 27, 2020 |publisher=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=December 2, 1988}}</ref> He remained with ''Fandango'' until 1989.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=220}} Anderson was then invited to join the cast of the TNN competition program ''You Can Be a Star.'' Anderson was involved in the show's inner workings, including helping to develop the scoring system. In addition, his touring band was hired as the show's stage band.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=220}}

Anderson appeared as himself in the February 15, 1965, episode of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', receiving two of the four possible votes. [[Major League Baseball]] pitcher [[Tracy Stallard]] appeared as one of the two imposters for Anderson.<ref>{{cite web |title=To Tell the Truth |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAQdTwP7k3A |website=[[CBS]] | date=November 24, 2013 |access-date=17 July 2022}}</ref>

===Business career===
Anderson also focused on business opportunities, many of which were unsuccessful. In his autobiography, he commented, "I've tried to become a businessman a couple of times when I should have kept right on pickin' and grinnin'."{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=213}} In 1975, he bought a radio station in [[Provo, Utah]], called [[KIXR|KIXX]]. Anderson was unable to have enough advertisers support his radio station, causing it to fail. Six years later, he sold the station and left the radio industry. "I was totally disillusioned by something I love", he wrote in 2016.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=214}}

In the 1980s, Anderson served as a spokesperson for the [[Po' Folks (restaurant)|Po' Folks]] restaurant chain, whose name was taken from his 1961 hit song.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Bill|title=Whisperin' Bill: An Autobiography|year=1989|publisher=Longstreet Press|page=305}}</ref> Anderson signed a three-year contract with the restaurant company to serve as their national spokesperson, appearing in radio and television commercials. In addition, Anderson signed off on allowing the company to use his photos and signatures to endorse their products.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=216}} He then partnered with the vice president to help franchise the company. Country artist [[Conway Twitty]] was selected as a third partner to also help with franchising. However, several individual restaurants encountered financial struggles, which resulted in legal fees that Anderson had to pay. In addition, the company was being bought out by the larger [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] fast-food chain. He was forced to pay back fees he owed towards the company, nearly causing Anderson to declare [[bankruptcy]]. However, with the support of Twitty, Anderson helped pay off the company's financial entanglements. "Even as it stood, my little foray into the restaurant business wiped out a large chunk of my life's savings", he later said.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=217–20}}

==Personal life==
Anderson has been married twice and has had two documented long-term relationships. He met his first wife, Bette ({{nee|Rhodes}}), in the late 1950s through a mutual friend. The pair married in December 1959. At the time of their marriage, Bette was 19 and Bill was 22. The couple remained married for ten years. Bette gave birth to two daughters during their relationship together.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|pp=70–71}} Bette also contributed to her husband's writing career when she co-wrote the 1965 song, "[[I Can't Remember]]". It was later recorded by [[Connie Smith]] on her 1965 studio album ''[[Cute 'n' Country]].''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Connie |title=''Cute 'n' Country'' (Liner Notes) |journal=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] |date=October 1965 |id=pm-3444}}</ref> The pair separated in 1968 and officially divorced in 1969. Reflecting on his divorce in 2016, Anderson believed it was difficult for Bette to understand the music business, causing them to drift apart.{{sfn|Anderson, Bill|Cooper, Peter|2016|p=71}} Bette Anderson died in 2010 at the age of 69.<ref>{{cite web |title=June 2, 2010 – Bill Anderson's Journal |url=https://billanderson.com/wired18/june-2-2010/ |website=Bill Anderson.com |date=June 2, 2010 |access-date=August 29, 2020}}</ref>

In 1970, he married his second wife, Becky.

Anderson briefly dated Deborah Marlin following his second divorce. In 2003, Anderson was arrested after being accused by Marlin of hitting her with his car door. He was released from jail the same day.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Bill Anderson Charged With Domestic Assault |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71815/bill-anderson-charged-with-domestic-assault |access-date=August 29, 2020 |date=March 27, 2003 |magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

Anderson began dating Vickie Salas around 2008. The couple had first met years prior when she was 19 and was romantically involved with Anderson's band member. The two reconnected following Anderson's second divorce. "We never married, we never lived together, but she became my everything", Anderson later remembered.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stefano |first=Angela |title=Vickie Salas, Bill Anderson's 'Longtime Companion', Dies |url=https://theboot.com/vickie-salas-bill-anderson-companion-dead-dies/ |website=The Boot |date=January 16, 2019 |access-date=August 29, 2020}}</ref> In 2016, Salas was diagnosed with cancer.

==Musical styles==
As a songwriter, Anderson has composed a variety of material. Author Kurt Wolff called his early compositions "cute and sentimental", citing "Po' Folks" and "I Love You Drops" to be examples of this style. Wolff also noted that other songs exemplified "anti-establishment attitudes" while other songs focused on themes that were "desperately bleak".{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}} Riane Konc of The Boot noted a similar trend in his songwriting style. She highlighted 2004's "Whiskey Lullaby" as an example. In reviewing the song, Konc commented that it was "packed full of unforgettable images" related to "heartbreak, addiction and loss". Konc also praised 2006's "Give It Away", calling it an "instant classic".<ref name="Top 10">{{cite web |last=Konc |first=Riane |title=Top 10 Bill Anderson Songs |url=https://theboot.com/top-bill-anderson-songs/ |website=The Boot |access-date=September 8, 2020}}</ref> In a 2018 interview with ''American Songwriter,'' Anderson described his songwriting style: "The lyric is what attracted me to country music as a young boy– the story songs that I could listen to and feel some emotion. So yeah, I'd like to have the next generation pull out a few lines I've written and say 'yeah that's pretty clever!'"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dye |first=Robert |title=A Q&A with Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee Bill Anderson |url=https://americansongwriter.com/qa-songwriters-hall-fame-inductee-bill-anderson/ |website=American Songwriter |date=June 11, 2018 |access-date=September 8, 2020}}</ref>

Anderson also created a musical style as a recording artist. After signing with Decca Records, he was given the nickname of "Whisperin' Bill Anderson", due to his soft-spoken vocal performance.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}} Writer and critic Kurt Wolff has commented on his "whispering" vocal style. Wolff also noted that many of his recordings included a combination of both "singing and recitation".{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=292}} Steve Huey of Allmusic called his voice "airy" and "gentle".<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> Stephen L. Betts of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that Anderson continues to demonstrate a whispering quality into his current work. In 2020, Betts stated that Anderson's vocal style "remains subdued in the present".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen L. |title=Bill Anderson to Revisit 60 Years of Hits on Upcoming Album |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/bill-anderson-hit-songs-new-album-1026834/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=July 10, 2020 |access-date=September 8, 2020}}</ref>

'''William Smith Monroe''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|n|ˈ|r|oʊ}} {{respell|mən|ROH}}; September 13, 1911<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1992 |publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]] |isbn=0-85112-939-0 |editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] |edition=1st |pages=1729–1730}}</ref> – September 9, 1996)<ref name="Flippo"/> was an American [[mandolin]]ist, singer, and songwriter, and created the [[bluegrass music]] genre. Because of this, he is often called the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#M|Father of Bluegrass]]".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Klein|first=Bradley|title=Bill Monroe: Celebrating The Father Of Bluegrass At 100|website=NPR.org |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/12/140366232/bill-monroe-celebrating-the-father-of-bluegrass-at-100|publisher=NPR|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

The genre takes its name from his band, the '''Blue Grass Boys''', who named their group for the [[Poa pratensis|bluegrass]] of Monroe's home state of [[Kentucky]]. He described the genre as "Scottish [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bill Monroe |website=2022 Monroe Mandolin Camp |url=https://monroemandolincamp.com/bill-monroe/ |access-date=2022-11-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Monroe was born on [[Bill Monroe Farm|his family's farm]] near [[Rosine, Kentucky]], the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan "Buck" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother, [[Pendleton Vandiver|James Pendleton "Pen" Vandiver]], were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Bill was of [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]] and [[English Americans|English]] heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and [[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]] already played the [[fiddle]] and [[guitar]], Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable [[mandolin]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolin's eight strings so he would not play too loudly.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Monroe's mother died when he was ten, and his father died six years later.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Eventually, his brothers and sisters moved away, leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver, whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances. This experience inspired one of Monroe's most famous compositions, "Uncle Pen", recorded in 1950,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and the 1972 album ''Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen.'' On that album, Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver. Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe "a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bill's aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bones."<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith |first=Richard D. |url=https://archive.org/details/cantyouhearmecal00smit/ |title=Can't You Hear Me Callin': the Life of Bill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass |date= |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-316-80381-6 |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |page=27 |language=en |oclc=42690222 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Also significant in Monroe's musical life was [[Arnold Shultz]], an influential [[fiddle]]r and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the [[blues]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Bluegrass Breakdown: The Making of the Old Southern Sound|author=Robert Cantwell|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|date=2003|isbn=9780252071171|pages=30–32}}</ref><ref>''The Father of Bluegrass Music'', DVD Documentary (1993)</ref>

==Professional career==
In 1929, Monroe moved to [[Indiana]] to work at an oil refinery with his brothers [[Birch Monroe|Birch]] and Charlie.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Together with a friend, Larry Moore, they formed the "Monroe Brothers", to play at local dances and house parties.

Birch and Moore soon left the group, and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo, eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations, first in Indiana and then, sponsored by Texas Crystals, on several radio broadcasts in [[Shenandoah, Iowa]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] from 1934 to 1936.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> [[RCA Records#Previous labels|RCA Victor]] signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song "What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul?" and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victor's [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label between 1936 and 1938.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Monroe: American Musician|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Monroe|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>

After the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938, Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but the group only lasted for three months.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Monroe then left Little Rock for [[Atlanta, Georgia]], to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boys,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> with singer/guitarist [[Cleo Davis]], fiddler Art Wooten, and bassist [[Amos Garren]].

In October 1939, Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], impressing Opry founder [[George D. Hay]] with his energetic performance of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]'s "[[Mule Skinner Blues]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Monroe recorded that song, along with seven others, at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940; by this time, the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singer/guitarist [[Clyde Moody]], fiddler Tommy Magness, and bassist Bill Wesbrooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doodah.net/bgb/|title=Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys|website=Doodah.net|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>

While the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks, Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group. He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings, often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers. A 1945 session for [[Columbia Records]] featured an [[accordion]], soon dropped from the band. Most importantly, Monroe added [[banjo]] player [[David "Stringbean" Akeman]] to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos. Monroe's pre-1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the [[string band|string-band tradition]] from which he came and the musical innovation to follow.

== "Original Bluegrass Band" and Monroe's heyday as a star ==
{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2022}}
Key developments occurred in Monroe's music with the addition of [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing. Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive three-finger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences. Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler [[Chubby Wise]] and bassist [[Howard Watts]], who often performed under the name "Cedric Rainwater".

In retrospect, this line-up of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the "Original Bluegrass Band", as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music, including breakneck tempos, sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements, and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or "breaks" on the mandolin, banjo, and fiddle. By this time, Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model "Lloyd Loar" mandolin, which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his career.<ref>Rosenberg, Neil V. (2005). ''BLUEGRASS: A History''. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press; {{ISBN|0-252-07245-6}}</ref>

The 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre, including "Toy Heart", "Blue Grass Breakdown", "[[Molly and Tenbrooks]]", "Wicked Path of Sin", "My Rose of Old Kentucky", "Little Cabin Home on the Hill", and Monroe's most famous song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954, appearing as the B-side of his first single for [[Sun Records]]. Monroe gave his blessing to Presley's [[rock and roll]] cover of the song, originally a slow [[ballad]] in [[waltz]] time, and re-recorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presley's version became a hit.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Several gospel-themed numbers are credited to the "Blue Grass Quartet", which featured four-part vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar – Monroe's usual practice when performing "sacred" songs.

Both Flatt and Scruggs left Monroe's band in early 1948, soon forming their own group, the [[Foggy Mountain Boys]]. In 1949, after signing with Decca Records, Monroe entered what has been called the "golden age" of his career<ref>''Bill Monroe and Bluegrass'' by Roughstock staff, January 27, 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |title=Roughstock's History of Country Music - Bill Monroe and Bluegrass |access-date=June 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620032558/http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |archive-date=June 20, 2009  }}</ref> with what many consider the classic "high lonesome" version of the Blue Grass Boys, featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of [[Jimmy Martin]], the banjo of [[Rudy Lyle]] (replacing [[Don Reno]]), and fiddlers such as Merle "Red" Taylor, [[Charlie Cline]], [[Bobby Hicks]], and [[Vassar Clements]].

This band recorded a number of bluegrass classics, including "My Little Georgia Rose", "On and On", "Memories of Mother and Dad", and "Uncle Pen", as well as instrumentals such as "Roanoke", "Big Mon", "Stoney Lonesome", "Get Up John", and the mandolin feature "Raw Hide". [[Carter Stanley]] joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when [[The Stanley Brothers]] had temporarily disbanded.

On January 16, 1953, Monroe was critically injured in a two-car wreck.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He and "Bluegrass Boys" bass player, [[Bessie Lee Mauldin]], were returning home from a fox hunt north of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. On highway 31-W, near White House, their car was struck by a drunken driver. Monroe, who had suffered injuries to his back, left arm and nose, was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville. It took him almost four months to recover and resume touring.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In the meantime [[Charlie Cline]] and [[Jimmy Martin]] kept the band together.<ref name="Rosenberg"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2024}}

By the late 1950s, however, Monroe's commercial fortunes had begun to slip.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The rise of rock-and-roll and the development of the "[[Nashville sound]]" in mainstream [[country music]] both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass. While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry, Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts, and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances.

==Folk revival==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}
Monroe's fortunes began to improve during the [[American folk music revival]] of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified.

The word "bluegrass" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, [[Reno and Smiley]], [[Jim & Jesse|Jim and Jesse]], and the [[Osborne Brothers]]. While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of [[Ralph Rinzler]], a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine ''[[Sing Out!]]'' that first publicly referred to Monroe as the "father" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at [[Roanoke, Virginia]] in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In 1964, before the [[Grateful Dead]] got together, [[Jerry Garcia]] caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gardenandgun.com/articles/jerry-garcias-bluegrass-roots/|title=Jerry Garcia's Bluegrass Roots|date=May 3, 2018|website=Gardenandgun.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

The growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] and singer/guitarist [[Peter Rowan]] from Massachusetts,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist [[Roland White]] and fiddler [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]] from California.

==Later years==
[[File:Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Hall of Fame Museum - June 2022 - Sarah Stierch.jpg|thumb|Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Hall of Fame Museum in [[Morgantown, Indiana]]. He founded the Hall in 1984.]]
Even after the folk revival faded in the mid-1960s, it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music. Bluegrass festivals became common, with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances.

In 1967, Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at [[Beanblossom, Indiana|Bean Blossom]] in southern Indiana, a park he had purchased in 1951,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands; a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt, and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973. The annual ''Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival'' is now the world's oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/loc.afc.afc-legacies.200002995/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905004417/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/IN/200002995.html|url-status=dead|title=Bill Monroe Bluegrass Festival in Brown County|first=Representative (9th District) Baron P.

Monroe's compositions during his later period were largely instrumentals, including "Jerusalem Ridge", "Old Dangerfield" (originally spelled Daingerfield after [[Daingerfield, Texas|the town in East Texas]]),<ref>"Stoney Lonesome Fiddle Book", by Stacy Phillips</ref> and "My Last Days on Earth"; he settled into a new role as a musical patriarch who continued to influence younger generations of musicians. Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s; the first featured collaborations with country stars such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musicians.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Monroe also kept a hectic touring schedule.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> On April 7, 1990, Monroe performed for [[Farm Aid|Farm Aid IV]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana along with [[Willie Nelson]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Neil Young]] and with many other artists.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Dawn |date=18 June 2007 |title=RetroIndy: Farm Aid IV raised a bumper crop of cash |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2017/06/18/farm-aid-iv-raised-bumper-crop-cash/395865001/ |access-date=2024-05-08 |website=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Death ===
Monroe's last performance occurred on March 15, 1996. He ended his touring and playing career in April, following a stroke. Monroe died on September 9, 1996, in [[Springfield, Tennessee]], four days before his 85th birthday.<ref name="Flippo">{{cite magazine|last1=Flippo|first1=Chet|title=Industry Mourns Father of Bluegrass|magazine=Billboard|date=September 21, 1996|pages=6, 79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9|access-date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Jon Pareles |author-link1=Jon Pareles |title=Bill Monroe Dies at 84; Fused Musical Roots Into Bluegrass |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/10/arts/bill-monroe-dies-at-84-fused-musical-roots-into-bluegrass.html |url-access=subscription |access-date=31 October 2021 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 September 1996 |page=D 22}}</ref>

== Legacy and influence ==

According to [[Ralph Rinzler]], Bill Monroe impacted music in the following five ways:<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Live Recordings 1963-1980: Off the Record Volume 2 |title-link= |last=Rinzler |first=Ralph |author-link=Ralph Rinzler |first2= |last2= |author-link2= |others= |url=https://folkways-media.si.edu/docs/folkways/artwork/SFW40064.pdf#page=6 |date=1993 |access-date= |chapter= |page=7 |pages= |at= |type= |publisher=[[Smithsonian Folkways]] |id= |location= }}</ref>

# When others were going electric, Bill created a space for an acoustic string band tradition to continue to grow and develop within country music.
# He developed a distinct vocal tradition - the "high lonesome" sound.
# He established the mandolin as a virtuoso string band instrument
# He composed a diverse repertoire of songs and instrumental tunes which have become standard fare among bluegrass, country, and some pop musicians.
# More than any other musician of his time, he skillfully infused country music with archaic tonal subtlety, including Anglo-Scots-Irish and Blues influences.

Bill Monroe was made an honorary [[Kentucky Colonel]] in 1966.<ref name="Rosenberg">{{Cite book |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Neil V. |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/jj.13944080 |title=The music of Bill Monroe |last2=Wolfe |first2=Charles K. |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-252-05623-9 |series=Music in American life |location=Urbana, IL |publication-date=2007 |jstor=10.5406/jj.13944080 |oclc=1431193963 |access-date=}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2024}} He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1970,<ref name="LarkinGE" /> the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1971,<ref name="LarkinGE" /> and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (as an "early influence") in 1997. [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams Sr.]], and [[Johnny Cash]] are the only other performers honored in all three. As the "father of bluegrass", he was also an inaugural inductee into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame|International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] in 1991. Monroe was a recipient of a 1982 [[National Heritage Fellowship]] awarded by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/1982|title=NEA National Heritage Fellowships 1982 |author=<!--Not stated-->  |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=November 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929133224/https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/1982 |archive-date=September 29, 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref> That year's fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA. In 1993, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], and he was awarded the [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]] in 1995. His well-known song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" has been covered not only by bluegrass but also rock and country artists, most notably Elvis Presley, [[Paul McCartney]], and [[Patsy Cline]]. In 2003, [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] had Bill Monroe ranked No.&nbsp;16 on ''CMT 40 Greatest Men of Country Music''.

Artists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe. He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass. He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards, "That ain't no part of nothin'." Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a "musical giant" and recognize that "there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroe."<ref>{{cite news|author=Teachout, Terry|title=Kentucky Troubadour: A biography of Bill Monroe and the bluegrass music he invented.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/09/17/reviews/000917.17teachot.html|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>

More than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroe's performing career. Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right. Some of Monroe's band members who went on to greater prominence include singer/guitarists [[Clyde Moody]], [[Lester Flatt]], Jack Cook, [[Mac Wiseman]], [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Carter Stanley]], [[Del McCoury]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Roland White]], Roland Dunn and [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Doug Green]]; banjo players [[Earl Scruggs]], Bob Black, [[Butch Robins]], [[Buck Trent]], [[Don Reno]], [[David "Stringbean" Akeman|Stringbean]], [[Osborne Brothers|Sonny Osborne]], and [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]]; and fiddlers Tommy Magness, [[Chubby Wise]], [[Vassar Clements]], [[Byron Berline]], [[Kenny Baker (fiddler)|Kenny Baker]], [[Bobby Hicks]], [[Gordon Terry]], [[Randall Franks]] and Glen Duncan. Monroe also regularly performed with flat-picking guitar virtuoso [[Doc Watson]].

Modern bluegrass singer and mandolin player [[Ricky Skaggs]] was influenced by Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha, Kentucky. He stated, "I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong. He was so influential: I think he's probably the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his band."<ref name="Music">{{cite book

==Early life==
Billy Strings was born William Lee Apostol on October 3, 1992, in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. His father died of a heroin overdose when he was two and his mother remarried Terry Barber, an accomplished amateur bluegrass musician whom Strings regards as his father. The family later moved to [[Morehead, Kentucky]], and then to [[Muir, Michigan]]. While he was still a preteen, his parents became addicted to methamphetamine. He left the family home at the age of 13 and went through a period of hard drug usage. His family eventually achieved sobriety; Billy stopped using hard drugs and drinking alcohol, becoming [[California sober|"California sober"]] and consuming only cannabis and similar "light drugs" (ie psychedelics).<ref name="RollingStoneJune2022">{{cite news |last1=Hudak |first1=Joseph |title=Drugs, Bluegrass, and Bass Fishing: How Billy Strings Outran His Past and Infiltrated the Mainstream |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/billy-strings-bluegrass-fishing-concert-1369241/ |access-date=25 August 2022 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=June 22, 2022}}</ref><ref name="northernexpress.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.northernexpress.com/news/feature/article-5963-the-amazing-billy-strings/|title=The Amazing Billy Strings|publisher=Northern Express}}</ref>

'''Carbon Leaf''' is a [[quintet]] from [[Richmond, Virginia]], known for their [[alt-country]], [[Celtic rock|Celtic]], and [[folk rock|folk]]-infused [[indie rock]]. Though some of the band members have changed through the years, Carbon Leaf has been consistently creating and performing music since the early 1990s. The band currently consists of founding members Barry Privett, Carter Gravatt, and Terry Clark, as well as Jon Markel and Jesse Humphrey. Carbon Leaf is best known for the song "Life Less Ordinary", which debuted in 2004 and reached #5 on Billboard's [[Adult Alternative Songs|Adult Alternative]] charts.

==History==
===1992–2004: The Constant Ivy Music years===
[[Image:Carbon Leaf (Barry Privett) in Cleveland, OH Grog Shop.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Barry Privett]]
Carbon Leaf got their start at [[Randolph-Macon College]] in [[Virginia]] in 1992, practicing in an auditorium on campus. Their next step was playing backyard parties, mixers, fraternity, and sorority parties. Shortly after everyone graduated, they moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. From Richmond, they played the college circuit in Virginia and up the East Coast before moving on to clubs. Their style is not "Brazilian Polka Metal", despite the joking claims of guitarist Carter Gravatt (B., David. 2002).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814181900/http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm |title=Carbon Leaf Interview -Chicago, 2002 |work=Blue Tint Magazine |archive-date=August 14, 2004}}</ref>

''[[Meander (album)|Meander]]'', their first album, was released in 1995. The first songs Carbon Leaf wrote, including "One Day" and "Country Monkee", are on the album.

''[[Shadows in the Banquet Hall]]'', released in 1997, includes "Flood", "Wolftrap and Fireflies", and "Attica's Flower Box Window". An award-winning video was made for "Flood".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

''[[Ether~Electrified Porch Music]]'' (1999) is the first album with Jordan Medas as the [[bassist]] and contains "Home", "American Tale", and "Blue Ridge Laughing".

The producers of ''[[Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!]]'' were using an acoustic version of "Life Less Ordinary" as a placeholder in the film.

'''Christopher Hillman''' (born December 4, 1944)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=190}}</ref> is an American musician. He was the original bassist of [[the Byrds]]. With frequent collaborator [[Gram Parsons]], Hillman was a key figure in the development of [[country rock]], defining the genre through his work with the Byrds, [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]] and the country-rock group [[the Desert Rose Band]]. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Byrds.

==Early life==
Hillman was born in Los Angeles, California, the third of four children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guitarist Chris Hillman|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=4766|access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref> He spent his early years at his family's ranch home in rural northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], approximately {{convert|110|mi}} from Los Angeles. He has credited his older sister with exciting his interest in [[Country music|country]] and [[folk music]], when she returned from college during the late 1950s with folk music records by [[The New Lost City Ramblers]] and others. Hillman soon began watching many of the country-music shows on local television in southern California at the time such as ''Town Hall Party'', ''The [[Spade Cooley]] Show'' and ''Cal's Corral''. Hillman's mother encouraged his musical interests and bought him his first guitar; shortly thereafter he developed an interest in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], particularly the [[mandolin]]. At the age of 15, Hillman went to Los Angeles to see the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]] bluegrass band at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]], and later convinced his family to allow him to travel by train to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] for lessons from mandolinist Scott Hambly. When Chris was 16, his father committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/interviews/CW98_chris_hillman.aspx |title=Chris Hillman: 'Turn, Turn, Turn' |website=Cbn.com |access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref>

Hillman became known in San Diego's folk music community as a solid player; this won him an invitation to join his first band, the [[Scottsville Squirrel Barkers]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The band lasted barely two years, recording only one album (''Blue Grass Favorites'', which was distributed in supermarkets); however, it has a posthumous reputation as the spawning ground for a number of musicians who went on to play in [[the Eagles]], the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, [[Hearts & Flowers]], and the [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]]. When the band broke up in late 1963 Hillman received an invitation to join the Golden State Boys, regarded as the top bluegrass band in [[southern California]] and featuring future country star [[Vern Gosdin]], his brother Rex and banjoist [[Don Parmley]] (later of the [[Bluegrass Cardinals]]). Shortly thereafter the band changed its name to [[The Hillmen]];<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> soon Hillman was appearing regularly on television and using a fictitious ID, "Chris Hardin", to allow the underage musician into the country bars where many of his gigs were played. When the Hillmen folded, he briefly joined a spinoff of Randy Sparks' [[The New Christy Minstrels|New Christy Minstrels]] known as the Green Grass Revival.

== Career ==

=== The Byrds (1964–1968) ===
{{main|The Byrds}}
[[File:The Byrds 1965.png|thumb|Hillman (far left) as a member of the Byrds in 1965]]
At this point a frustrated Hillman considered quitting music and enrolling at [[UCLA]] when he received an offer from The Hillmen's former manager and producer, Jim Dickson, to join Jim (later Roger) McGuinn, David Crosby, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke in a new band, The Byrds.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Hillman was recruited to play bass guitar, although he had never picked up the instrument. Thanks to his bluegrass background, he quickly developed his own melodic style on the instrument. The Byrds' first single, a jangly cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", was an international hit and marked the birth of [[folk rock]]. During the mid-1960s the Byrds ranked as one of the most successful and influential American pop groups; they recorded a string of hits, including "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", "[[Eight Miles High]]" and "[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]".

Hillman kept a low profile on the band's first two albums, on which McGuinn and Clark shared lead vocals with Crosby adding high harmony and singing the bridge on "[[All I Really Want to Do]]". However, Clark's departure in 1966 and Crosby's growing restlessness allowed Hillman the opportunity to develop as a singer and songwriter in the group. He came into his own on the Byrds' 1967 album ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', co-writing and sharing lead vocals with McGuinn on the hit "[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Hillman also wrote (and sang) the minor hit "[[Have You Seen Her Face]]", "Thoughts and Words", "Time Between" and "The Girl with No Name", the latter two demonstrating his bluegrass and country roots. Hillman's prominence continued with the Byrds' next album, ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'', on which he shared songwriting credit on seven of the album's eleven songs.

=== Pioneering country rock ===
Internal strife dogged the Byrds, and by the beginning of 1968 the band was down to two original members (Hillman and McGuinn), with Hillman's cousin [[Kevin Kelley (musician)|Kevin Kelley]] on drums. They then hired [[Gram Parsons]] to replace Crosby. Hillman, who had brought country music into the Byrds' earliest recording of "Satisfied Mind", found another lover of country music in Parsons.  ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' was recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and continues to inspire musicians in the Americana format.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Parsons left the band shortly thereafter; Hillman brought in former Kentucky Colonels guitarist [[Clarence White]] as a replacement and White suggested that the group replace Kelley with [[Gene Parsons]] (no relation to Gram) on drums, but this line-up was short-lived and Hillman himself left the Byrds due to financial misappropriation by their management.

=== The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969–1972) ===
{{Main article|The Flying Burrito Brothers}}
[[File:FlyingBurritos1970.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: [[Pete Kleinow|'Sneaky' Pete Kleinow]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], Chris Hillman, [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] & [[Bernie Leadon]] ]]

Hillman teamed with Gram Parsons again (this time as vocalist, guitarist and songwriter) to form the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Further honing their pioneering country-rock hybrid sound by combining the energy, instrumentation and attitude of [[rock and roll]] with the issues and themes of [[country music]], the Burritos recorded the landmark ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'' (1969) followed by 1970's ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]''. Parsons was fired from the line-up by June 1970 (replaced by guitarist [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]]) when the band toured Canada as part of the [[Festival Express]] tour, with Hillman reverting to bass guitar. Hillman stayed with the band for two more records, ''[[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|The Flying Burrito Brothers]]'' and ''[[Last of the Red Hot Burritos]]''.

=== Various bands and solo career (1970s) ===
{{Main article|Manassas (band)|Souther-Hillman-Furay Band|McGuinn, Clark & Hillman}}
Before the Flying Burrito Brothers disbanded, Hillman joined [[Stephen Stills]]' band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]].<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> They released two albums, a 1972 [[Manassas (album)|self-titled double album]], and a 1973 album ''[[Down the Road (Manassas album)|Down the Road]]''. Led by Stills, Manassas was an exploration into a mixture of rock, country, blues, bluegrass and Latin music. In 1972, Stills gave Hillman a 1924 [[Lloyd Loar]] [[Gibson F-5]] mandolin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lewis |first=Randy |date=2017-09-18 |title=Byrds co-founder Chris Hillman taps David Crosby, Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty for new solo album |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-chris-hillman-bidin-my-time-tom-petty-20170810-story.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-09-18 |title=Chris Hillman |url=https://www.latimes.com/94338813-132.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> Hillman remained with Manassas until 1973, when he briefly re-joined the original line-up of the Byrds for a reunion album on [[Asylum Records]].

In 1974, Hillman teamed with singer-songwriter [[Richie Furay]] (who co-founded [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Poco (band)|Poco]]) and songwriter [[JD Souther]] (who co-wrote much of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' early repertoire) in the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]].<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> The trio never quite gelled, and broke up in 1975 after two albums and internal squabbles.

Hillman released two solo albums, ''Slippin' Away'' and ''Clear Sailin''',<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> which included several songs co-written with ''[[Crawdaddy!|Crawdaddy]]'' magazine editor [[Peter Knobler]]. One of their songs, "Step on Out," was recorded by [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] on their 1985 album and became the title cut. He was also an in-demand studio musician, playing and singing on sessions for [[Gene Clark]], [[Dillard & Clark]], [[Poco (band)|Poco]], [[Dan Fogelberg]] and others. After an early 1977 UK tour reunited him with [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Gene Clark]], the trio stayed together as [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]] for two albums<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> (on which Hillman continued his songwriting collaboration with Knobler) and one under the McGuinn-Hillman name, with a hit single in 1979's "Don't You Write Her Off".

=== The Desert Rose Band (1985–1994, 2008) ===
{{Main article|The Desert Rose Band}}
By the early 1980s Hillman had returned to his bluegrass and country roots, recording two acclaimed (mainly acoustic) albums for [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] with singer/guitarist/banjo player [[Herb Pedersen]] (a former member of [[The Dillards]]). Soon after, Hillman and Pedersen formed the [[Desert Rose Band]];<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> this proved to be Hillman's most commercially successful post-Byrds project. Their self-titled debut album in 1987 generated two [[Record chart|Top Ten]] country hits in "Love Reunited" (written with Steve Hill), "One Step Forward" and the number-one single "He's Back and I'm Blue." From 1987 until late 1993 the band recorded five albums and one Greatest Hits package and had a string of 16 country-music [[Billboard magazine|hits]] (the majority of which were in the country Top Ten) and a number of [[Academy of Country Music]] awards before disbanding in 1994. As Hillman said, "We definitely quit while we were ahead."

Chris Hillman, Herb Pedersen, JayDee Maness, John Jorgenson, Bill Bryson, and Steve Duncan performed their first reunion concert on August 27, 2008  in Solana Beach, CA. Before this date Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen were as a duo joined by John Jorgenson on May 2, 2008 for a small DRB set at the [[Station Inn]] in Nashville. This six-man lineup is the best known, and includes all of the original members present on the hit albums from the 1980s. At this show, Hillman said it was the first time they had played together in 19 years. They went through a string of DRB hits but were unable to play "He's Back and I'm Blue" because Hillman said he had forgotten the words. This sold-out show prompted Hillman and the band to play a handful of other reunion shows at  music festivals throughout the U.S. Several of these were recorded for inclusion on a live album, which Hillman hopes to release in the U.S. and Europe. If released, this will be the Desert Rose Band's only live album.

=== 1990s and beyond ===
[[File:ChrisHillman.jpg|thumb|Hillman in 2004]]
At the peak of the Desert Rose Band's success, Hillman began appearing infrequently with McGuinn. A duet recorded by the pair for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]'s ''[[Will The Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II]]'' album, "You Ain't Going Nowhere", reached the Country Top 10 in 1989. Soon the pair joined Crosby in a reformed Byrds, playing a handful of club dates. In 1990 they appeared at a tribute to [[Roy Orbison]], performing "Mr. Tambourine Man" with the song's composer [[Bob Dylan]]. That same year the Byrds cut four new songs for inclusion in a career-spanning box set, and in 1991 they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 1996 Hillman reunited with Desert Rose Band alumnus Herb Pederson for the CD ''Bakersfield Bound''. ''Like a Hurricane'' (1998) and three bluegrass-flavored releases on [[Rounder Records]] with Pedersen, [[Larry Rice (musician)|Larry Rice]], and [[Tony Rice]] followed. He appeared on the 1999 album ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'' in a duet with [[Steve Earle]] on "High Fashion Queen" (which Hillman wrote with Parsons).

After a brief hiatus Hillman and Pedersen returned with ''Way Out West'' (2002), a 17-track collection of country, [[roots rock]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]]; this was followed by ''The Other Side'' (2005). In 2010 he recorded "Live at Edwards Barn" with Herb Pedersen for Rounder Records.

Hillman has continued to write, perform and tour, with dates in 2017 with Herb Pedersen and John Jorgenson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrishillman.com/calendar.html |title=Tour Dates |publisher=Chris Hillman |access-date=2017-10-07}}</ref>  He released his latest album, ''Bidin' My Time'' (2017), co-produced with [[Tom Petty]], featuring guests including Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and members of The Heartbreakers. This has been described as "a kind of summing up of Hillman's long and varied career, incorporating the folk, bluegrass, country and rock styles he's touched on over the years."<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|title=Byrds Legend Chris Hillman Premieres Tom Petty-Produced 'Bidin' My Time' Album: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7968856/chris-hillman-bidin-my-time-album|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 7, 2017|date=September 19, 2017}}</ref>

Along with Roger McGuinn, Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives, Hillman toured in the U.S. with the 50th Anniversary of the Sweetheart of the Rodeo, to sold out venues and outstanding reviews.

His memoir, ''Time Between: My Life as a Byrd, Burrito Brother and Beyond,''  was published by BMG Books in November 2020, with positive reviews in Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, and now in the second printing.

Chris Hillman identifies as a Christian although his father was Jewish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/counsel-of-elders-chris-hillman-on-looking-across-time/|title=Counsel of Elders: Chris Hillman on Looking Across Time|date=2017-11-10|website=The Bluegrass Situation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> He married  former record executive Connie Pappas in 1979, who influenced him to affiliate with the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|Greek Orthodox Church]]. He later stated, "I’m still learning. You know what I do on Sundays? I sing in a choir.

==Biography==

==History==

===1981–2000: Early life and career===
Thile was born in [[Oceanside, California]], in 1981. His earliest memories of music are listening to [[Stan Getz]]'s recording of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]" before he even turned one year old. When he was two, his family started going to That Pizza Place, where he listened to John Moore's band Bluegrass Etc. When Thile was four, his family moved to [[Idyllwild, California]].

Thile began playing the mandolin at the age of five, taking occasional lessons from John Moore. At age eight, Thile's family and the Watkins family formed [[Nickel Creek]]. The band performed at many California bluegrass festivals, and as a result Chris had to be [[homeschooling|home-schooled]]. At age twelve, he won the mandolin championship at the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]].

That same year, 1993, Thile made a demo tape and sent it to the Sugar Hill and Rounder record labels. Both labels showed interest, but the Thiles went with Sugar Hill.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ibluegrass.com/bg_posting3.CFM?p__i=426&p__r=&p__a=inter | title = Chris Thile: Covering the Bases | publisher = iBluegrass.com | date = May 20, 1999 | access-date = 2007-08-30 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121182607/http://www.ibluegrass.com/bg_posting3.CFM?p__i=426&p__r=&p__a=inter | archive-date = November 21, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The next year, Chris Thile released his first solo album, ''[[Leading Off]]'', featuring mostly original compositions.

In 1995, the Thile family moved to [[Murray, Kentucky]], where Chris' father Scott Thile accepted a position at [[Murray State University]] as a musical instrument technician.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waynerice.com/bgbios/bgbiosn.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214081710/http://waynerice.com/bgbios/bgbiosn.htm |archive-date=December 14, 2014 |title=N}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://campus.murraystate.edu/staff/scott.thile/index.html|title=Scott E.

Chris went on to attend [[Murray State University]] for a few semesters, where he was a music major.<ref name="bases"/> In 2000, he went to [[Nashville]] to play mandolin on [[Dolly Parton]]'s bluegrass/Appalachian folk album ''[[Little Sparrow]]''.

===2001–2005: ''Wander'' and ''Deceiver''===
{{Main|Not All Who Wander Are Lost (album)|Deceiver (Chris Thile album)}}
Following the major success of the album ''[[Nickel Creek (album)|Nickel Creek]]'', Thile released ''[[Not All Who Wander Are Lost (album)|Not All Who Wander Are Lost]]'' in 2001. The album featured guest appearances from several well-known instrumentalists such as Stuart Duncan, [[Béla Fleck]], [[Edgar Meyer]], [[Jerry Douglas]], and [[Bryan Sutton]].

In 2003, Thile teamed up with mandolinist [[Mike Marshall (bluegrass musician)|Mike Marshall]] for the duet album ''Into the Cauldron'', which included original pieces as well as pieces by [[Charlie Parker]] and [[J. S. Bach]]. Also in 2003, Thile joined [[Mark O'Connor]] for his double CD set "Thirty-Year Retrospective" which was nominated for a Grammy. In 2004, Thile released ''[[Deceiver (Chris Thile album)|Deceiver]]'', an experimental album on which he recorded every track himself. This included electric guitar, piano, drums, violin, viola, cello, and bass. ''Deceiver'' demonstrated some pop/rock songwriting in addition to "newgrass".

===2006–present: Punch Brothers and Edgar Meyer project===
{{Main|How to Grow a Woman from the Ground|Punch (album)}}
[[File:Chris Thile 2008 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Chris Thile with Punch Brothers at Wintergrass, 2008]]
In August 2006, Nickel Creek announced that at the end of the year, they would no longer be recording together as a group, and their tour scheduled through 2007 would be their last for an indefinite period of time. In February 2014, the group announced that it would be releasing another album.

Thile was a judge for the fifth annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Past Judges for the Independent Music Awards Include |publisher=Independentmusicawards.com |access-date=February 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024722/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |archive-date=July 13, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In 2006, Thile formed [[Punch Brothers|How to Grow a Band]], with whom he recorded ''[[How to Grow a Woman from the Ground]]'', Thile's fifth album. In an interview with the ''Nashville City Paper'', Thile described the band's formation:
{{blockquote|We got together one night just to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships. We had gotten to play together a few days before and we had said that we needed to do something musical together. With our hearts smashed to pieces, it became more urgent – our lives had gone the same way for so long. I knew I wanted to have a band with Gabe [Witcher], but I didn't know if it would be a rock ensemble, an ambitious acoustic classical thing or a bluegrass group. We played, and there was a serious, instantaneous connection. Then I knew I wanted to put together a bluegrass band – one with a lot of range, but aesthetically a bluegrass band.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section=12&screen=news&news_id=51705  | title = Nickel Creek's Thile 'grows' a new band | publisher = Nashville City Paper | date = August 23, 2006 | access-date = 2007-10-13 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826212803/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section=12&screen=news&news_id=51705 |archive-date = August 26, 2006}}</ref>
}}

The band consisted of Chris Thile (mandolin), [[Gabe Witcher]] (fiddle/violin), [[Chris Eldridge]] (guitar), Greg Garrison (bass), and [[Noam Pikelny]] (banjo). [[Bryan Sutton]] has also filled in on guitar when necessary while Eldridge played out commitments to [[The Infamous Stringdusters]]. In 2007, the band officially changed its name first to "The Tensions Mountain Boys" and then "[[Punch Brothers]]".

On March 17, 2007, at [[Carnegie Hall]], this group debuted Thile's ambitious "The Blind Leaving the Blind", a 40-minute suite in four movements that Thile told [[NPR]] was written in part to deal with his 2004 divorce.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2008/02/29/69406288/bluegrass-suite-packs-a-progressive-punch|title=Bluegrass Suite Packs a Progressive 'Punch'|date=February 29, 2008|work=NPR.org|access-date=February 13, 2015}}</ref>

To promote "Punch", Thile and Punch Brothers planned a year-long tour in 2008, as well as a February 29 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/calendar/02252008.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331114400/http://www.nbc.com/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/calendar/02252008.shtml |archive-date=March 31, 2009 |title=Show Calendar}}</ref> In late 2008, Paul Kowert replaced Garrison on bass. Punch Brothers released ''[[Antifogmatic (album)|Antifogmatic]]'' on February 15, 2010, and continued to tour. On November 5, 2010, the band performed "Rye Whiskey" on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' with [[Steve Martin]] guesting on banjo.

In August 2008, Thile and [[double bass|bassist]] [[Edgar Meyer]] announced the release date of the duo's planned debut album. The album was released on Thile's label [[Nonesuch Records]] on September 23, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nonesuch.com/journal/chris-thile-edgar-meyer-preview-new-album-at-aspen|title=Chris Thile, Edgar Meyer Preview New Album at Aspen|work=Nonesuch Records Official Website|date=August 13, 2008 |access-date=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Commenting on the collaboration, Thile said "Edgar is one of the biggest influences on my musical life, and now I'm in a duo with him and writing songs with him.

Together with frequent collaborator [[Gene Parsons]], he invented the [[B-Bender]], a guitar accessory that enables a player to mechanically bend the B-string up a [[major second|whole tone]] and emulate the sound of a [[pedal steel guitar]]. White was inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted a second time in 2019 as a member of the Kentucky Colonels.

==Early years==
Clarence Joseph LeBlanc was born on June 7, 1944, in [[Lewiston, Maine]].<ref name="Kingsbury"/> The LeBlanc family, who later changed their surname to White, were of French-Canadian ancestry and hailed from New Brunswick, Canada.<ref name="Kingsbury"/><ref name="byrdwatcher">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Clarence White with the Kentucky Colonels: 1954-1965|publisher=Euclid Business Network|website=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/memcw1.html|access-date=2013-08-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903085652/http://ebni.com/byrds/memcw1.html|archive-date=2013-09-03}}</ref>  Clarence's father, Eric LeBlanc Sr., played [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]], [[banjo]], [[fiddle]], and [[harmonica]], ensuring that his offspring grew up surrounded by music.<ref name="Kingsbury"/><ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  A child prodigy, Clarence began playing guitar at the age of six.<ref name="rogan">{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|author-link=Johnny Rogan|title=Requiem for the Timeless: Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-408-8|page=469}}</ref>  At such a young age he was barely able to hold the instrument and as a result, he briefly switched to [[ukulele]], awaiting a time when his young hands would be big enough to confidently grapple with the guitar.<ref name="timeless"/>

In 1954, when Clarence was ten, the White family relocated to Burbank, California and soon after, Clarence joined his brothers [[Roland White|Roland]] and Eric Jr. (who played [[mandolin]] and banjo respectively) in a trio called Three Little Country Boys.<ref name="hjort"/>  Although they initially started out playing contemporary [[country music]], the group soon switched to a purely [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] repertoire, as a result of Roland's burgeoning interest in the genre.<ref name="Kingsbury"/>

In 1957, banjoist Billy Ray Latham and [[Dobro]] player LeRoy Mack were added to the line-up,<ref name="timeless"/> with the band renaming themselves the Country Boys soon after.<ref name="hjort"/> In 1961, the Country Boys also added Roger Bush on double bass, as a replacement for Eric White Jr.<ref name="hjort"/>  That same year, Clarence and other members of the Country Boys appeared on two episodes of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''.<ref name="hjort"/>  Between 1959 and 1962, the group released three [[Single (music)|singles]] on the Sundown, Republic, and Briar International [[record label]]s.<ref name="disc">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Clarence White Discography|publisher=Euclid Business Network|website=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/refdiscogcw.html|access-date=2013-08-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820140041/http://ebni.com/byrds/refdiscogcw.html|archive-date=2013-08-20}}</ref>

==The Kentucky Colonels==
{{main|Kentucky Colonels (band)}}
Following the recording sessions for the Country Boys' debut album, the band changed its name to the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]] in September 1962, at the suggestion of country guitarist and friend [[Joe Maphis]].<ref name="hjort"/>  The band's album was released by Briar International under the title ''The New Sound of Bluegrass America'' in early 1963.<ref name="timeless2">{{Cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|pages=581–584|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited - The Sequel|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>

Around this time, Clarence's [[flatpicking]] guitar style was becoming a much more prominent part of the group's music.<ref name="Kingsbury"/>  After attending a performance by [[Doc Watson]] at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] folk club in Los Angeles, where he also met the guitarist, Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitar's role in bluegrass music.<ref name="Kingsbury"/>  At that time, the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass, with only a few performers, such as  Watson, exploring its potential for soloing.<ref name="Kingsbury"/>  White soon began to integrate elements of Watson's playing style—including the use of open strings and syncopation—into his own flatpicking guitar technique.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument<ref name="timeless2"/> was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrass.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-guitarists-1234814010/clarence-white-3-1234814623/|title=250 Greatest Guitarists: #107 Clarence White|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media|access-date=2024-07-27}}</ref>

The Kentucky Colonels became well known on the bluegrass circuit during this period and made many live appearances throughout California and the United States.<ref name="hjort"/>  Between bookings with the Colonels, White also made a guest appearance on [[Eric Weissberg]] and [[Marshall Brickman]]'s ''New Dimensions in Banjo & Bluegrass'' album, which would be re-released in 1973 as the [[soundtrack album]] to the film ''[[Deliverance]]'' (with Weissberg and Steve Mandell's version of "[[Dueling Banjos]]" added to the album's track listing).<ref name="byrdwatcher"/><ref>{{Cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=dueling-banjos-mw0000651271|pure_url=yes}}|title="Dueling Banjos" from the Original Soundtrack Deliverance album review|last=Johnson|first=Zac|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corp]]|access-date=2013-08-13}}</ref>

In 1964, the Colonels recruited fiddle player Bobby Sloan and continued to make live appearances at various clubs, concert halls and festivals.<ref name="hjort"/> The Colonels' second album, ''[[Appalachian Swing!]]'',<ref name="timeless2"/> was a commercial success and saw White's flatpicking permanently expand the language of bluegrass guitar.<ref name="hjort2">{{Cite book|last=Hjort|first=Christopher|page=18|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> Music critic Thom Owens has remarked that White's playing on the album, "helped pioneer a new style in bluegrass; namely, he redefined the acoustic guitar as a solo instrument."<ref name="allmusic2">{{Cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=appalachian-swing%21-mw0000706601|pure_url=yes}}|title=Appalachian Swing! album review|last=Owens|first=Thom|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corp]]|access-date=2013-08-13}}</ref>

Shortly after the recording of the ''Appalachian Swing!'' album, Roland and Clarence undertook some [[Session musician|session work]] backing dobroist [[Tut Taylor]] on a Dobro-themed album that was released by World Pacific Records in late 1964 as ''Dobro Country''.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  Although the brothers were employed as session musicians, the album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>

Although the Colonels were a successful recording act, it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living, due to the waning popularity of the [[American folk music revival]] due to the [[British Invasion]] and homegrown [[folk rock]] acts, such as [[the Byrds]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  As a result, the Colonels switched to [[electric instrument]]ation<ref name="byrdwatcher"/> and hired a [[drummer]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Delgatto|first=John|title=The Too-Short Career of Clarence White|pages=12–14|newspaper=Frets Magazine|publisher=GPI Publications|location=Cupertino, California|year=1986}}</ref>  In spite of these changes, the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31, 1965.<ref name="timeless2"/>  Clarence, Roland and Eric Jr. formed a new line-up of the Colonels in 1966, with several other musicians, but this second version of the group was short-lived and by early 1967 they had broken up.<ref name="byrdwatcher2">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Clarence White Plugs In: 1965-1968|publisher=Euclid Business Network|website=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/memcw2.html|access-date=2013-08-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730163100/http://ebni.com/byrds/memcw2.html|archive-date=2013-07-30}}</ref>

During 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards [[rock 'n' roll]] as an avenue for artistic expression.<ref name="timeless"/>  Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like [[Doc Watson]], [[Don Reno]] and [[Joe Maphis]], he also idolized the playing of [[jazz guitarist]] [[Django Reinhardt]], rock 'n' roller [[Chuck Berry]], and studio musician [[James Burton]].<ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>  White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song "Mr. Tambourine Man" with electric instruments.<ref name="timeless"/>  However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity<ref name="timeless"/> and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schinder|first1=Scott|last2=Schwartz|first2=Andy|page=261|year=2008|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever – Volume 1|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8}}</ref>

By the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist.<ref name="timeless"/>  Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his [[Martin D-28]] acoustic guitar to an electric [[Fender Telecaster]], with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton.<ref name="lightning"/>  Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from [[open chord]]ing to [[fret]]ting the whole [[Neck (music)|guitar neck]] with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls.<ref name="lightning"/>  However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Monkees]], and the [[Vern Gosdin|Gosdin Brothers]].<ref name="timeless"/><ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>

Despite being on tour or in the recording studio with the Byrds for the majority of the time between 1969 and 1972, White continued to undertake selected session work for other recording artists.  During this period he played on [[Joe Cocker]]'s 1969 album ''[[Joe Cocker!]]'', [[Randy Newman]]'s 1970 album ''[[12 Songs (Randy Newman album)|12 Songs]]'', and [[the Everly Brothers]]' ''[[Stories We Could Tell]]'' from 1972.<ref name="allmusic"/>  In early 1971, White also contributed guitar to [[Paul Siebel]]'s ''[[Jack-Knife Gypsy]]'' album and the title track of the ''L.A.

In mid-February 1973, just prior to the break up of the White-era version of the Byrds, White joined with guitarist [[Peter Rowan]], mandolinist [[David Grisman]], fiddler [[Richard Greene (fiddle player)|Richard Greene]], and banjoist [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] to form the bluegrass [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Muleskinner (band)|Muleskinner]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hjort|first=Christopher|page=313|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref>  The musicians initially assembled as a one-off [[Pickup group|pickup band]] to back bluegrass pioneer [[Bill Monroe]] for a television program, but ended up performing on their own when Monroe's tour bus broke down on the way to the television studios.<ref name="byrdwatcher4"/>  A recording of this broadcast, which was once thought lost, was released as an album in 1992, under the title ''[[Muleskinner Live: Original Television Soundtrack|Muleskinner Live]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Muleskinner Live: Original Television Soundtrack]]|others=[[Muleskinner (band)|Muleskinner]]|year=2003|last=Koon|first=William Henry|page=2|type=CD booklet|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Pasadena, CA}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|page=584|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited–The Sequel|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  A [[VHS|VHS video cassette]] of the broadcast was also released in 1992 and later re-issued on [[DVD]].

As a result of the success of their appearance on the television broadcast, the band was offered a one album [[recording contract]] with [[Warner Bros.

In addition to his work with Muleskinner, White also undertook a number of sessions between late 1972 and early 1973 for his friend Gene Parsons' debut solo album ''[[Kindling (album)|Kindling]]''.<ref name="parsons">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Kindling (album)|Kindling]]|others=[[Gene Parsons]]|year=1994|last=Parsons|first=Gene|author-link=Gene Parsons|pages=4–6|type=CD booklet|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>  White's distinctive guitar and mandolin playing can be heard on the tracks "Do Not Disturb", "On the Spot", "Sonic Bummer", "I Must Be a Tree", "Banjo Dog", "Back Again", and "Drunkard's Dream" (the latter of which also features White contributing harmony vocals).<ref name="parsons"/>

Following completion of the ''Muleskinner'' album in April 1973, White reunited with his brothers Roland and Eric Jr. for a tour as the White Brothers (a.k.a. The New Kentucky Colonels).<ref name="byrdwatcher4"/>  After playing a handful of shows in California, the White Brothers departed for Europe in May 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smokemusicarchive.com/content/roland-white-solo-record|title=A Record of His Own: Roland White's Solo Reissued|last=Moses|first=Bob|website=Smoke Music Archive|publisher=Smoke Creative|access-date=2014-03-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004101904/http://www.smokemusicarchive.com/content/roland-white-solo-record|archive-date=2015-10-04}}</ref>

Returning to the U.S., White's final bout of touring took place with the New Kentucky Colonels in June 1973, as part of a four-date country rock package tour with Gram Parsons, [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]], [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], Gene Parsons, [[Byron Berline]], and [[Chris Ethridge]] among others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=David N.|title=Twenty Thousand Roads: The Ballad of Gram Parsons and His Cosmic American Music|year=2007|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-375-50570-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/twentythousandro00meye/page/404 404–405]|url=https://archive.org/details/twentythousandro00meye/page/404}}</ref>  Although Gram and Clarence had been acquainted with one another since the Byrds' ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' sessions, the pair would develop a fast friendship during the mini-tour, after a very acrimonious re-acquaintance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|author-link=Ben Fong-Torres|title=Hickory Wind: The Life and Times of Gram Parsons|year=1998|publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-312-19464-2}}</ref>  Following the end of the package tour, White entered the recording studio with producer Jim Dickson on June 28 and 29, 1973 to begin work on a solo album.<ref name="silver">{{cite AV media notes|title=Silver Meteor: A Progressive Country Anthology|others=Various artists|year=1980|last=Koon|first=William Henry|type=LP sleeve|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>  He recorded a total of six songs,<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=Requiem for the Timeless: Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-408-8|pages=625–626}}</ref> four of which would belatedly be released on the archival album ''Silver Meteor: A Progressive Country Anthology'' in 1980.<ref name="silver"/>

==Death==
White died on July 15, 1973, after being struck by a drunk driver.<ref name="hjort6"/><ref>"Car kills Topanga musician", ''Long Beach (CA) Press-Telegram'', Monday, July 16, 1973, p. 13 (A Topanga musician loading instruments aboard his van was struck and killed Sunday...")</ref> The accident occurred shortly after 2 a.m., while he and his brother Roland were loading equipment into their car in Palmdale, California, following a White Brothers concert. Gram Parsons was especially shaken by his death; he led a singalong of "[[Farther Along (song)|Farther Along]]" at White's funeral service and later conceived his final song (before his own death), "In My Hour of Darkness", as a partial tribute to White.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

==Musical influence==
Clarence White helped popularize the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass music, building on the work of guitarists such as Doc Watson. Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White, the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument, save for a few exceptions (such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist [[Don Reno]]). Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence, including [[Dan Crary]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], and [[Tony Rice]].  Rice owned and played White's highly modified 1935 [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-28. [[David Grier]] and [[Russ Barenberg]] are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by White's guitar work.  White's bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]],<ref name="lightning"/> who traveled with the band during 1964.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Livin' in the Past|others=[[Kentucky Colonels]]|year=2003|first=John|last=Delgatto|page=2|type=CD booklet|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Pasadena}}</ref>

On the electric side of the guitar spectrum, White was similarly influential.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Together with fellow Byrds bandmember [[Gene Parsons]], White invented the [[B-Bender]] device. This device raises the B-string (second string) of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar. It is activated by pushing down on the neck, and produces a "[[pedal steel]]" type sound. [[Arlen Roth]], heavily influenced by this style, did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a B-bender, so instead developed his own unique all-finger bending version of this technique. This was heavily documented in his ground-breaking book, "Nashville Guitar", all of his recordings, as well as his book "Masters of the Telecaster". Subsequently, his [[Telecaster]] sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing. [[Marty Stuart]], another guitarist influenced by White's playing, now owns and regularly plays White's 1954 [[Fender Telecaster]] with the prototype B-Bender.<ref>[http://www.martystuart.com/ZArt-GuitarPlayer8-94.htm] Gill, Chris: "Steel And Wood, Heart And Soul - The Marty Stuart Guitar Collection," reprinted from ''Guitar Player Magazine'', August 1994.</ref>

Music archivist and writer [[Alec Palao]] has called White "one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music", before adding that "the waves created by the guitarist's idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll."<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Tuff & Stringy: Sessions 1966-68|chapter=Part One: Sometimes the Journey Can Be as Interesting as the Destination|others=Clarence White|year=2003|last=Palao|first=Alec|page=4|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Ace Records (United Kingdom)|Ace Records]]|location=London}}</ref>  In 2003, White was ranked No.&nbsp;41 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2010, guitar manufacturer [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] ranked White at No.&nbsp;42 on their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-524/|title=Gibson.com Top 50 Guitarists of All Time – 50 to 41|publisher=Gibson.com|access-date=2010-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530105529/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-524/|archive-date=2010-05-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

'''Daniel Ivan Hicks''' (December 9, 1941 &ndash; February 6, 2016) was an American singer-songwriter and musician, and the leader of '''Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks'''. His idiosyncratic style combined elements of [[Folk music|cowboy folk]], [[jazz]], [[Country music|country]], [[swing music|swing]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Popular music|pop]], and [[gypsy style|gypsy]] music. He is perhaps best known for the songs "I Scare Myself" and "Canned Music". His songs are frequently infused with humor, as evidenced by the title of his tune "How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?" His album ''Live at Davies'' (2013) capped over forty years of music.

Writing about Hicks for ''[[Oxford American]]'' in 2007, critic David Smay said, "[T]here was a time from the ’20s through the ’40s when swing—'hot rhythm'—rippled through every form of popular music. That’s the music Dan Hicks plays, and there’s no single word for it because it wasn’t limited to any one genre. [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[the Mills Brothers]] and [[Spade Cooley]] and [[Hank Garland]] and the [[Boswell Sisters]] and [[Stuff Smith]] and [[Bing Crosby]] all swing. You can make yourself nutty trying to define what Dan Hicks is. Then again, you could just say: Dan Hicks swings."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danhicks.net/oxford_american_article.pdf|title=Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks|website=Danhicks.net|access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref>

==Early life==
{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2023}}
Hicks was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] on December 9, 1941.<ref name="Cancer"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0382831/|title=Dan Hicks|work=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]]|access-date=February 6, 2016|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}</ref> the only child of Ivan L. Hicks (a career [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force]] [[non-commissioned officer]]) and the former Evelyn Kehl. At age five, Hicks moved with his family to California. Following brief stints in [[Lomita, California|Lomita]], [[Cambria, California|Cambria]], and [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], the family settled in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], the largest city in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] subregion of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], where he was a drummer in grade school and played the snare drum in his school marching band.

At 14, he was performing with area dance bands. While in high school, he had a rotating spot on ''Time Out for Teens'', a daily 15-minute local radio program. After receiving an [[Associate of Arts|A.A.]] in general education from [[Santa Rosa Junior College]], he went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in broadcasting from [[San Francisco State College]] in 1965. Taking up the guitar in 1959, he became part of the [[American folk music revival]] scene during his undergraduate studies, often dropping out intermittently to perform at venues across the United States. Strongly influenced by the [[Jim Kweskin]] [[jug band|Jug Band]], he would cultivate friendships with several of the group's members (most notably [[Maria Muldaur]]) later in life.

Although he maintained an equivocal stance toward [[rock music]] (lauding the early recordings of [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Byrds]] while retrospectively maintaining that "rock has never really been my thing"), Hicks joined seminal [[San Francisco Sound|San Francisco]] [[psychedelic rock]] band [[The Charlatans (American band)|The Charlatans]] on [[drum kit|drums]] in 1965.<ref name="ReferenceA">''I Scare Myself: A Memoir''. Dan Hicks with Kristine McKenna. Jawbone Press, 2017.</ref>

In this capacity, he participated in the group's celebrated summer 1965 engagement at the [[Red Dog Saloon (Virginia City, Nevada)|Red Dog Saloon]] in [[Virginia City, Nevada]]. After the band failed to secure a long-term recording contract, he switched to [[rhythm guitar]] in 1967 and briefly performed his original material as the group's frontman before leaving in 1968.

==Bandleader==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2023}}
In 1967, Hicks formed Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks with violinist [[David LaFlamme]] as a vehicle for new songs rooted in his longstanding appreciation for acoustic-based forms of pre-rock popular music. In one of their earliest engagements, the group opened for The Charlatans; members of the latter band were surprised to see Hicks performing with a different ensemble.

In 1968, LaFlamme left to form [[It's a Beautiful Day]] and was replaced by jazz violinist and fellow Santa Rosan "Symphony" [[Sid Page]]. Following several lineup changes, vocalists Sherry Snow and Christine Gancher, guitarist Jon Weber, and bassist Jaime Leopold filled out the band, which had no drummer. This line-up was signed to [[Epic Records|Epic]] and in 1969 issued the album ''Original Recordings'', produced by [[Bob Johnston]]. The first major Hot Licks lineup lasted until 1971 and then broke up.

{{quote box|quote="If Hicks's acoustic stylings react against the excesses of [[1960s counterculture|counterculture]] [[futurism|futurists]], then the key moment on this live album [''Where's the Money?''] comes when he corrects 'his wife' with 'I should say old lady' and no one laughs. Hicks is delicate, tuneful, and droll, with an ear for [[colloquial]] history in words and music both, but he's so diffident about focus that his mock nostalgia is too easy to mistake for the right thing."|source=—''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: H|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=H&bk=70|access-date=February 26, 2019|via=Robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

When Hicks reformed the band, Page and Leopold remained, and vocalists Naomi Ruth Eisenberg and Maryann Price joined, followed later by guitarist John Girton and drummer Bob Scott. This group recorded three albums, culminating in 1973's ''Last Train to Hicksville''. Following years of critical success, the album gained the group wider acclaim, peaking at #67 during an eighteen-week stay on the ''Billboard'' album chart; during this period, the group headlined at [[Carnegie Hall]] and appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. Nevertheless, Hicks dissolved the group by the end of the year, a decision that inspired a [[Charles Perry (food writer)|Charles Perry]]-penned ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover story.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/enigmas-on-thin-ice-dan-hicks-breaks-up-his-hot-licks-72492/|title=Enigmas on Thin Ice: Dan Hicks Breaks Up His Hot Licks|first1=Charles|last1=Perry|date=August 30, 1973|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref> In 1997, he reflected on the decision: “It was getting old. We became less compatible as friends. I was pretty disillusioned, had some money, and didn’t want to do it any more.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/arts/music/dan-hicks-bandleader-of-the-hot-licks-dies-at-74.html|title=Dan Hicks, of the Hot Licks, Dies at 74; Countered the '60s Sound|first=Peter|last=Keepnews|date=February 7, 2016|website=Nytimes.comaccessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

Over the next decade, Hicks seldom recorded while subsisting on Hot Licks royalties in his adopted hometown of [[Mill Valley, California]]. Envisaged as the soundtrack for an early iteration of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]'' (1982), the acclaimed ''It Happened One Bite'' was released as Hicks' first solo album by [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1978; however, it only managed to peak at #155 in ''Billboard''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dan-hicks|title=Dan Hicks|website=Billboard.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/hicks.html|title=Liner Notes for Dan Hicks's "It Happened One Bite"|website=Richieunterberger.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref> Often performing under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[opioids]] and [[cocaine]], his reputation was sullied by a series of belligerent solo concerts. Following rehabilitation, he appeared with [[Asleep at the Wheel]] at [[Farm Aid]] II in 1986, auguring his return to the popular consciousness. Although he briefly resumed using alcohol and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in the mid-1990s (a period that culminated in arrests for public intoxication and driving under the influence), Hicks would credit [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] with maintaining his sobriety.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The classic Hot Licks lineup reunited for an appearance on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' in 1991. The program also featured Hicks' new group, [[The Acoustic Warriors]], a combination of folk, swing, jazz and country which included Brian Godchaux on violin and mandolin, Paul "Pazzo" Mehling on guitar, and Richard Saunders on bass.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musiclinernotes.wordpress.com/category/blues/page/2/|access-date=February 6, 2016|work=Music Liner Notes|title=Dan Hicks}}</ref> In 1993, the Acoustic Warriors continued to perform locally around San Francisco and on the road, but this edition placed Paul Robinson on guitar, Nils Molin or Alex Baum on [[string bass]], [[Stevie Blacke]] on [[mandolin]] and Josh Riskin on drums. Hicks recorded one CD with the Acoustic Warriors. ''[[Shootin' Straight]]'' was released by [[Private Music]] in 1996. Recorded live at McCabe's in [[Santa Monica]], it featured [[Jim Boggio]] on accordion/piano, Stevie Blacke on mandolin/violin, Paul Robinson on guitar, Alex Baum on bass and former Hot Lick Bob Scott on drums.

Beginning with ''Beatin’ the Heat'' (featuring [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Ricki Lee Jones]] and [[Brian Setzer]]) in 2000, Hicks returned to releasing albums with a reconstituted lineup of the Hot Licks on Surfdog Records. ''Alive and Lickin’'', a live album with the Hot Licks, followed in 2001. In 2003, Surfdog released ''Dan Hicks and The Hot Licks: Featuring an All-Star Cast of Friends'', a live CD/DVD package. These albums reinvigorated Hicks, and the guests reflected their longtime admiration for the Hot Licks. Dan Hicks and The Hot Licks' comeback was met with widespread critical acclaim and led to several more albums under the Surfdog label. ''Selected Shorts'' featuring [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Gibby Haynes]] was released in 2004, then a downloadable compilation of Hicks's previously released duets in 2007, ''Tangled Tales'' in 2009, ''Crazy For Christmas'' in 2010, and ''Live at Davies'' in 2013. To honor Dan on the first anniversary of Dan Hicks passing, Surfdog Records released ''Greatest Licks – I Feel Like Singin’'', a compilation album paying tribute and celebrating Dan's life and legacy, in February 2017.

In his later years, Hicks occasionally played jazz standards at intimate venues in the San Francisco Bay Area with Bayside Jazz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baysidejazz.com/|title=Bayside Jazz with Dan Hicks|website=Baysidejazz.com|date=September 11, 2010|access-date=February 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211173116/http://www.baysidejazz.com/|archive-date=February 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the film  ''[[Class Action (film)|Class Action]]'' (1991), Hicks is seen performing with Eisenberg and Price at Rosatti's in San Francisco. He also can be seen in several documentary films, including ''[[Revolution (1968 film)|Revolution]]'' (1968) and ''Rockin at the Red Dog'' (1996).

From its founding in 1977 until late in his life, Hicks played with the San Francisco Bay Area's Christmas Jug Band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://christmasjugband.com/story.html|title=The Christmas Jug Band: Media Kit: The CJB Story|website=Christmasjugband.com|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

'''David Akeman''' (June 17, 1915<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lex18.com/story/29345805/kentucky-festival-marks-stringbeans-100th-birthday|title=Kentucky Festival Marks Stringbean's 100th Birthday|website=Lex18.com|access-date=May 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518060115/http://www.lex18.com/story/29345805/kentucky-festival-marks-stringbeans-100th-birthday|archive-date=May 18, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> – November 10, 1973)<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> better known as '''Stringbean''' (or '''String Bean'''), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, comedian, and semiprofessional baseball player<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wideopencountry.com/rise-fall-stringbean-akeman/|title=The Rise and Fall of Stringbean Akeman, a Grand Ole Opry Legend|author=Burchard, Jeremy|publisher=Wide Open Country|date=August 1, 2016|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref> best known for his role as a main cast member on the hit television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and as a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Akeman was well known for his "old-fashioned" [[banjo]]-picking style, careful mix of comedy and music, and his memorable stage wardrobe (which consisted of a long nightshirt tucked into a pair of short blue jeans belted around his knees — giving him the comical appearance of a very tall man with stubby legs). Akeman and his wife were shot and murdered by burglars in their rural Tennessee home near Ridgetop in 1973.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in [[Annville, Kentucky|Annville]],<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=Guinness Publishing|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=398/400}}</ref> Akeman came from a musical family, including his father, James Akeman, who played the banjo at local dances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://davidakeman.com/|title=David Akeman, AKA StringBean|website=Davidakeman.com|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref> He got his first banjo when he was 12 years old in exchange for a pair of prize [[bantam (poultry)|bantam chickens]].<ref name="Larkin50"/> Akeman began playing at local dances and gained a reputation as a musician, but the income was not enough to live on. He joined the Depression-era [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], building roads and planting trees.

Eventually, he entered a talent contest judged by [[Asa Martin]]. He won and was invited to join Martin's band. During an early appearance, Martin forgot Akeman's name and introduced him as "String Bean" because of his tall, thin build. Akeman used the nickname the rest of his career.<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=Virgin Books|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|pages=423/4}}</ref>

Akeman originally was only a musician, but when another performer failed to show up one night, he was used as a singer and comic. From then, Akeman did both comedy and music. He appeared on WLAP-AM in Lexington, Kentucky and played with several groups in the late 1930s.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Akeman also played semiprofessional baseball.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Administrator |date=2020-09-09 |title=Marc Hoover: The tragic death of David 'Stringbean' Akeman |url=https://www.clermontsun.com/2020/09/09/marc-hoover-the-tragic-death-of-david-stringbean-akeman |access-date=2022-03-29 |website=The Clermont Sun |language=en-US}}</ref> As a ballplayer, he met [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] pioneer [[Bill Monroe]], who fielded with another semipro team. From 1943 to 1945, Akeman played banjo for Monroe's band, performing on recordings such as "Goodbye Old Pal". He also teamed with Willie Egbert Westbrook as String Beans and Cousin Wilbur, a comedy duo who appeared on the same bill as Monroe's band. When he left Monroe, he was replaced by [[Earl Scruggs]], a [[banjoist]] with a very different style.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

In 1945, Akeman married Estell Stanfill.<ref name="Larkin50"/> The same year, he formed a comedy duet with Willie Egbert Westbrook,<ref name="Larkin50"/> and they were invited to perform on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. The following year, Akeman began working with [[Grandpa Jones]], another old-time banjo player and comedian.<ref name="Larkin50"/> Jones and Akeman worked together at the Opry and many years later on the ''Hee Haw'' television series.<ref name="Larkin50"/> They also became neighbors in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Akeman became a protégé of [[Uncle Dave Macon]], one of the biggest Opry stars. Near the end of his life, Macon gave Akeman one of his prized banjos.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Later years===
Akeman, by now known only as Stringbean, was one of the Opry's major stars in the 1950s.<ref name="Larkin50"/> He adopted a stage costume that accentuated his height—a shirt with an exceptionally long waist and tail, tucked into a pair of short blue jeans belted around his knees. The costume had many antecedents, including Slim Miller, a onetime stage comedian said to be Akeman's inspiration.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Akeman did not record as a solo artist until the early 1960s, when he was signed by the Starday label.<ref name="Larkin50"/>  Akeman remained a celebrated performer of the old-fashioned banjo playing, "[[clawhammer]]" or "frailing".  In addition to his skill as a clawhammer player, Akeman also frequently played two-finger banjo, using thumb and forefinger. Akeman is listed with Uncle Dave Macon, Grandpa Jones, and [[Ralph Stanley]] as the greatest old-time style banjo pickers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Akeman kept his audience with his traditional playing and his mixture of comedy and song. He scored country-chart hits with "Chewing Gum" and "I Wonder Where Wanda Went".<ref name="Larkin50"/> Between 1962 and 1971, he recorded seven albums.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The first, ''Old Time Pickin' & Grinnin' with Stringbean'' (1961), included folk songs (especially humorous animal songs), tall stories, and country jokes.

In 1969, Akeman and Grandpa Jones became cast members of a new television show entitled ''Hee Haw''.<ref name="Larkin50"/> One of his regular routines was reading a "letter from home" to his friends. Asked about the latest letter, Stringbean would take it out, saying he carried it "right next to my heart". Not finding it in his overalls pocket, he would check all of his other pockets by patting them with his hands until he found the letter, usually in his hip pocket. He was also the scarecrow in a cornfield who said one-liners before being shouted down by the crow on his shoulder. ''Hee Haw'' continued airing his taped segments following his death and his final episode was season five, episode 26, which aired on March 23, 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Q: Which "Hee Haw" performer was killed during a robbery at his home? {{!}} TV Tabloid |url=http://decoy.tvpassport.com/q_a/q-which-hee-haw-performer-was-killed-during-robbery-his-home |access-date=2022-03-29 |website=decoy.tvpassport.com}}</ref>

===Murder===
Akeman was modest and unassuming, and he enjoyed hunting and fishing. Accustomed to the hard times of the [[Great Depression]], Akeman and his wife Estell lived frugally in a small cabin at 2308 Baker  Road, near Ridgetop, Tennessee. Their only indulgences were a Cadillac and a color TV. Depression-era bank failures caused Akeman not to trust banks with his money.<ref name="Larkin50"/> Gossip around Nashville was that Akeman kept large amounts of cash on hand, though he was by no means wealthy by entertainment industry standards.

On Saturday night, November 10, 1973, Akeman and his wife returned home after he performed at the Grand Ole Opry. Both were shot dead shortly after their arrival. The killers had waited for hours. Their corpses were discovered the following morning by their neighbor, musician [[Grandpa Jones|Louis "Grandpa" Jones]].<ref name="Larkin50"/>

[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine, noting that Akeman had never learned to read or write, disclosed that he and his wife had a combined $5700 in cash on them when murdered—and that their killers had left the crime scene in Akeman's own automobile.<ref>"'Stringbean' and Wife Killed in Suspected Robbery Try." Billboard, 24 November 1973, 28.</ref>

A police investigation resulted in the convictions of cousins John A. Brown and Marvin Douglas Brown, both 23 years old. They had ransacked the cabin, and killed Akeman when he arrived. His wife shrieked when she saw her husband murdered. She begged for her life, but was shot as well. According to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, "Upon their return, Mr. Akeman spotted the intruders in his home and evidently offered some resistance. One of the Brown cousins fatally shot Mr. Akeman, then pursued, shot, and killed Mrs. Akeman. At their trial (where Akeman's fellow cast member and friend Grandpa Jones testified, as he recognized one of the stolen firearms in the defendants' possession as a gift he had given Akeman), each defendant blamed the other for the homicides."<ref>''Brown v. State'', unpublished decision at 1991 WL 242928.</ref> The killers took only a chainsaw and some firearms.

Marvin Douglas Brown fought his convictions in the appellate courts. On September 28, 1982, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial judge's order denying him a new trial.<ref>''State v. Brown'', 644 S.W.2d 418 (Tenn.Crim.App. 1992). On November 21, 1991, the same court denied his motion for post conviction relief. (''State v. Brown'', unpublished decision available at 1991 WL 24298)</ref> Marvin Brown ultimately granted an exclusive interview to Larry Brinton of the ''Nashville Banner''. He admitted his part in the burglary and murders, but insisted John Brown fired the fatal shots. As Marvin Brown, by his own admission, had committed burglary (a felony) that resulted in death, Brown was legally guilty of murder, regardless of who fired the shots, under Tennessee's [[felony murder rule]].

Marvin Brown died of natural causes in 2003, at the [[Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary]] in Petros, Tennessee, and he is buried in the prison cemetery. John Brown was incarcerated in [[Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility]] in Nashville. In July 2008, the Tennessee Parole Board deferred any parole for 36 months. He was again denied parole in July 2011. In 2014, John Brown was granted parole and released after serving 41 years of a 198-year sentence.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wkrn.com/story/26793495/stringbean-killer-john-brown-granted-parole |title=Man who killed Opry, 'Hee Haw' star Stringbean granted parole - WKRN News 2 |access-date=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018090606/http://www.wkrn.com/story/26793495/stringbean-killer-john-brown-granted-parole |archive-date=October 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2014/11/03/stringbean-akemans-killer-free-parole/18439335/|title=Stringbean Akeman's killer free on parole|website=Tennessean.com|access-date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>

The [[A&E Network|A&E]] cable television network profiled the case on a 1999 episode of its ''[[City Confidential]]'' series.

David and Estelle Akeman are buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens]] in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. During the remaining production of ''[[Hee Haw]]'', the scarecrow was left as a memorial.<ref>Resting Places: The Burial Sites of Over 14000 Famous Persons by Scott Wilson</ref>

[[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] artist [[Sam Bush]] recorded "The Ballad of Stringbean and Estelle", which tells the story of their murders, for his 2009 album ''[[Circles Around Me]]''. The song was written by Bush, [[Guy Clark]], and [[Verlon Thompson]], and he was nominated by the IBMA for Song of the Year in 2011.

The '''Del McCoury Band''' is a [[Grammy award]]-winning American [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band.

==History==
Originally the band was called [[Del McCoury]] and the Dixie Pals with Del on guitar and his brother Jerry on bass. The band went through a number of changes in personnel until the 1980s when the band solidified its line-up, adding McCoury's sons, [[Ronnie McCoury|Ronnie]] and [[Robbie McCoury|Robbie]] on mandolin and banjo, respectively.<ref>Kingsbury, Paul, [https://books.google.com/books?id=untabCgOVkgC&dq=del+McCoury&pg=PA335 The Encyclopedia of Country Music]. Oxford University Press, 1998. p. 335</ref> In 1988, the "Dixie Pals" name was dropped in favor of the current name. Fiddler Tad Marks and bass player Mike Brantley joined in the early 1990s while the band became a national touring act.<ref name=DM-nodep-1996>{{cite news|last1=Yates|first1=Don|title=Album Review: Del McCoury Band - The Cold Hard Facts|url=http://nodepression.com/album-review/del-mccoury-band-cold-hard-facts|access-date=17 April 2017|work=No Depression|date=31 October 1996|archive-date=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418163126/http://nodepression.com/album-review/del-mccoury-band-cold-hard-facts|url-status=dead}}</ref> The addition of fiddler [[Jason Carter (fiddler)|Jason Carter]] and bassist [[Mike Bub]] in 1992 created a lineup that was unchanged for 13 years.

'''Delano Floyd McCoury''' (born February 1, 1939) is an American [[bluegrass music]]ian. As leader of the [[Del McCoury Band]], he plays guitar and sings lead vocals along with his two sons, [[Ronnie McCoury]] and [[Rob McCoury]], who play mandolin and banjo respectively. In June 2010, he received a [[National Heritage Fellowship]] lifetime achievement award from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and in 2011 he was elected into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]].

==Career==
McCoury has had a long career in bluegrass. Although originally hired as banjo player, he sang lead vocals and played rhythm guitar for [[Bill Monroe]]'s Blue Grass Boys in 1963,<ref>{{cite book |first1=Kurt |last1=Wolff |first2=Orla |last2=Duane |title=Country Music: The Rough Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&pg=PA234 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Rough Guides]] |isbn=978-1-85828-534-4 |pages=234–235}}</ref> with whom he first appeared on the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. McCoury briefly appeared with the [[Golden State Boys]] in 1964 before taking a series of day jobs in construction and logging, while continuing to work as an amateur musician in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.<ref name="GACTV">{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/musicbeat/dmccoury120505.html |title=Del McCoury makes bluegrass a family affair |website=[[Great American Family|GACTV]] |date=December 5, 2005 |access-date=February 11, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110154435/http://www.gactv.com/musicbeat/dmccoury120505.html |archive-date=January 10, 2006}}</ref>

In the 1980s his sons began performing with him. Fiddler [[Tad Marks]] and bass player Mike Brantley joined McCoury's group in early 1990s. McCoury's group toured widely throughout the US.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Kingsbury |editor-first=Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=untabCgOVkgC&dq=del+McCoury&pg=PA335 |title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1998 |page=335 |isbn=9780199770557}}</ref> They relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] as they began to attract attention.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Watson was born in [[Deep Gap, North Carolina]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1235/6}}</ref>  According to Watson on his three-CD biographical recording ''[[Legacy (Doc Watson album)|Legacy]]'', he got the nickname "Doc" during a live radio broadcast when the announcer remarked that his given name Arthel was odd and he needed an easy nickname. A fan in the crowd shouted "Call him Doc!", presumably in reference to the literary character [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s companion, [[Doctor Watson]].  The name stuck.<ref name="Legacy">
{{cite video
  | people = Doc Watson

  | publisher = High Windy Audio

  |date = 2002}}</ref>

An eye infection caused Watson to lose his vision before his second birthday.<ref name="Larkin"/> He attended North Carolina's school for the blind, the [[Governor Morehead School]], in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].<ref name="Kaufman">{{cite book| last = Kaufman| first = Steve| title = The Legacy of Doc Watson| publisher = Mel Bay Publications| year = 1999| page = 152| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Et6zwlhPwUcC | isbn = 978-0-7866-3393-7}}</ref>

In a 1989 radio interview with [[Terry Gross]] on the ''[[Fresh Air]]'' show on [[National Public Radio]], Watson spoke about how he got his first guitar. His father told him if he and his brother David chopped down all the small dead [[chestnut tree]]s along the edge of their field, they could sell the wood to a [[tannery]].  Watson bought a Sears Silvertone from [[Sears Roebuck]] with his earnings,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://equipboard.com/pros/doc-watson/sears-silvertone-1448l-model-57|work=equipboard.com|title=The Guitar of Doc Watson}}</ref> while his brother bought a new suit.<ref name="firstguitar">

| access-date =2010-09-03 }}</ref> Later in the same interview, Watson mentioned that his first high-quality guitar was a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-18.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fretbase.com/blog/2010/9/doc-watsons-first-martin-guitar/ |title=Fretbase, Doc Watson's first Martin Guitar |publisher=Fretbase.com |date=September 9, 2010 |access-date=2012-05-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307230958/http://www.fretbase.com/blog/2010/9/doc-watsons-first-martin-guitar/ |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Watson's earliest influences were country roots musicians and groups such as the [[Carter Family]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. The first song he learned to play on the guitar was "When Roses Bloom in Dixieland", first recorded by the [[Carter Family]] in 1930. Watson said in an interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'' that "[[Jimmie Rodgers]] was the first man that I started to claim as my favorite."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/r-i-p-doc-watson-read-our-2012-interview/|title=R.I.P. Doc Watson; Read Our 2012 Interview|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=May 30, 2012}}</ref>  Watson proved to be a natural musical talent and within months was performing on local street corners playing songs from the [[Delmore Brothers]], [[Louvin Brothers]], and [[Bill Monroe|Monroe Brothers]] alongside his brother Linny. By the time Watson reached adulthood, he had become a proficient acoustic and electric guitar player.<ref name="misterguitar">{{cite web|url=http://www.misterguitar.com/bios/watsonbio.html|title=Doc Watson|publisher=Chet Atkins: Mister Guitar – Books & Bios|work=misterguitar.com/bios|access-date=2008-11-28}}</ref>

===Career===
[[File:Doc Watson 1994-4.jpg|thumb|Watson performing in 1994]]

In 1953, Watson joined the [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]–based Jack Williams's [[country and western]] [[Swing music|swing]] band on [[electric guitar]]. The band seldom had a [[fiddle]] player, but was often asked to play at [[square dance]]s. Following the example of country guitarists [[Grady Martin]] and [[Hank Garland]], Watson taught himself to play fiddle tunes on his [[Gibson Les Paul]] electric guitar. He later transferred the technique to acoustic guitar, and playing fiddle tunes became part of his signature sound.<ref name="miller"/><ref name="AG">{{cite web | last = Havighurst | first = Craig | title = Living Legacy | publisher = Acoustic Guitar magazine | date = June 2003 | url = http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag126/feature126.html | access-date = November 20, 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090429095130/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag126/feature126.html | archive-date = April 29, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>  During his time with Jack Williams, Watson also supported his family as a [[piano tuner]].

In 1960, as the [[American folk music revival]] grew, Watson took the advice of folk [[musicologist]] and [[Smithsonian]] [[curator]] [[Ralph Rinzler]] and began playing acoustic guitar and [[banjo]] exclusively.<ref name="Kaufman" /> That move ignited Watson's career when he played on his first recording, ''Old Time Music at [[Clarence Ashley]]'s''.  Also of pivotal importance for his career was his February 11, 1961, appearance at [[P.S. 41]] in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | last = Grimes | first = William | title = Doc Watson, Blind Guitar Wizard Who Influenced Generations, Dies at 89 | newspaper = New York Times  | date = May 29, 2012 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/arts/music/doc-watson-folk-musician-dies-at-89.html | access-date = May 30, 2012}}</ref> He then began to tour as a solo performer and appeared at universities and clubs like the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Watson would eventually get his big break and rave reviews for his performance at the renowned [[Newport Folk Festival]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in 1963.<ref name="Larkin"/>  Watson recorded his first solo album in 1964 and began performing with his son, [[Merle Watson|Merle]] in the same year.<ref name="Larkin"/>

After the folk revival waned during the late 1960s, Doc Watson's career was sustained by his performance of the [[Jimmy Driftwood]] song "[[Tennessee Stud]]" on the 1972 live album recording ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]''.  As popular as ever, Doc and Merle began playing as a trio with [[T. Michael Coleman]] on bass guitar in 1974. The trio toured the globe during the late seventies and early eighties, recording nearly fifteen albums between 1973 and 1985, and bringing Doc and Merle's unique blend of acoustic music to millions of new fans.<ref name="AG"/> In 1985, Merle died in a tractor accident on his family farm. Two years later [[MerleFest|Merle Fest]] was inaugurated in remembrance of him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/86014/interview-docs-orders-no-heavy-metal-merlefest|title=Interview- Doc's orders: No heavy metal at MerleFest|website=Readthehook.com|access-date=2016-05-16|archive-date=May 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530212257/http://www.readthehook.com/86014/interview-docs-orders-no-heavy-metal-merlefest|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:DocW Sculpture Boone.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Watson sculpture on the corner of King and Depot Streets in [[Boone, North Carolina]].

{{quote box|width=22em|[[Arlen Roth]] writes, "...we can attribute an entirely new style and a whole generation of pickers to [Watson's] inspiration.  He was the first rural acoustic player to truly 'amaze' urban audiences in the early 1960s with his dazzling, fast technique, and he has continued to be a driving, creative force on the acoustic music scene."<ref>{{cite book| last=Roth| first=Arlen| title=Arlen Roth's complete acoustic guitar| publisher=Schirmer Books| date=1985| page=47| isbn=0-02-872150-0}}</ref>}}

Doc Watson played guitar in both [[flatpicking]] and [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] style, but is best known for his flatpick work. His guitar playing skills, combined with his authenticity as a mountain musician, made him a highly influential figure during the folk music revival. He pioneered a fast and flashy [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] lead guitar style including fiddle tunes and [[crosspicking]] techniques which were adopted and extended by [[Clarence White]], [[Tony Rice]] and many others. Watson was also an accomplished banjo player and sometimes accompanied himself on harmonica as well. Known also for his distinctive and rich [[baritone]] voice, Watson over the years developed a vast repertoire of mountain [[ballad]]s, which he learned via the [[oral tradition]] of his home area in [[Deep Gap, North Carolina]].

Watson played a [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] model D-18 guitar on his earliest recordings. In 1968, Watson began a relationship with Gallagher Guitars when he started playing their G-50 model. His first Gallagher, which Watson referred to as "Ol' Hoss", was on display at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] before residing at the Gallagher shop until 2012, when it was auctioned through [[Christie's]] on November 27, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Release: Christie's to Offer a Range of Fine Musical Instruments in November from Italian Masters to Contemporary Classics |url=https://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=5934&lid=1&mob-is-app=false |access-date=2022-07-23 |website=www.christies.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1974, Gallagher created a customized G-50 line to meet Watson's preferred specifications, which bears the Doc Watson name. In 1991, Gallagher customized a personal [[Cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]] guitar for Watson that he played until his death and which he referred to as "Donald" in honor of Gallagher guitar's second-generation proprietor and builder, Don Gallagher.<ref name="callow">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallagherguitar.com/flatpickart.html|title=Gallagher Guitars|last=Callow|first=John|date=January 1997|publisher=Flatpicking Guitar Magazine, Vol 1, No 2|work=flatpick.com|access-date=2008-11-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108001406/http://www.gallagherguitar.com/flatpickart.html|archive-date=November 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During his last years, Watson played a [[Dana Bourgeois]] [[Dreadnought (guitar type)|dreadnought]] given to him by [[Ricky Skaggs]] for his 80th birthday.

In his later life, Watson scaled back his touring schedule. He was generally joined onstage by his grandson (Merle's son) Richard, as well as longtime musical partners [[David Holt (musician)|David Holt]] or [[Jack Lawrence (bluegrass)|Jack Lawrence]]. On June 19, 2007, Watson was accompanied by Australian guitar player [[Tommy Emmanuel]] at a concert at the [[Bass Performance Hall]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Watson also performed, accompanied by Holt and Richard, at the [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass]] festival in [[San Francisco]] in 2009, as he had done for several previous festivals.

Watson hosted the annual [[MerleFest]] music festival held every April at [[Wilkes Community College]] in [[Wilkesboro, North Carolina]]. The festival features a vast array of acoustic style music focusing on the folk, bluegrass, [[blues]] and old-time music genres. It was named in honor of Merle Watson and is one of the most popular acoustic music festivals in the world, drawing over 70,000 music fans each year.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/obit/story/2012-05-29/doc-watson-dies/55271498/1 | title=Doc Watson, folk music legend, dies at 89 | work=[[USA Today]] | date=May 30, 2012 | access-date=May 30, 2012 | last=Mansfield | first=Brian | archive-date=May 30, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530103832/http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/obit/story/2012-05-29/doc-watson-dies/55271498/1 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The festival has continued after his death.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Watson married Rosa Lee Carlton, the daughter of popular fiddle player [[Gaither Carlton]]. The couple had two children, [[Merle Watson|Eddy Merle]] (named after country music legends [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Merle Travis]]) in 1949 and Nancy Ellen in 1951.<ref name="Kaufman" />

'''Dolly Rebecca Parton''' (born January 19, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter, actress, and philanthropist, known primarily for her decades-long career in [[country music]]. After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]'', which led to success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), before her sales and chart peak arrived during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Some of Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.

With a career spanning 60 years, Parton has been described as a "country legend" and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Blistein |first=Jon |date=November 20, 2023 |title=Dolly Parton Updates Her Classic 'Jolene' for Her Rock & Roll Era |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dolly-parton-bonus-songs-new-album-rockstar-1234886964/ |access-date=January 20, 2024 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Yahr |first=Emily |date=October 17, 2023 |title=Dolly Parton was told 'gaudy' clothes would hurt her career.

In 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In 2005, she received the [[National Medal of Arts]], and in 2022, she was nominated for and inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], a nomination she had initially declined but ultimately accepted.

Outside of her work in the music industry, she also co-owns [[The Dollywood Company]], which manages a number of entertainment venues including the [[Dollywood]] theme park, the [[Dollywood's Splash Country|Splash Country]] water park, and a number of [[dinner theatre]] venues such as The Dolly Parton Stampede and Pirates Voyage.

Parton's mother cared for their large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Parton attributes her musical abilities to the influence of her mother; often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountain]] [[folklore]] and ancient [[ballad]]s. Having [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestors, Avie Lee knew many old ballads that [[immigrants]] from the British Isles brought to southern [[Appalachia]] in the 18th and 19th century.{{Failed verification|date=September 2024}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hyland |first1=Claire |title=Nine startling facts about the Queen of Country music Dolly Parton |url=https://evoke.ie/2021/02/19/showbiz/dolly-parton-surprising-facts |website=EVOKE |date=February 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Good golly Miss Dolly... 10 amazing facts about Ms Parton |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/dolly-parton-facts-heads-cardiff-7310302 |work=Wales Online |access-date=May 12, 2021 |date=June 23, 2014}}</ref> Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a [[Pentecostal]] preacher, and Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly.

She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, "Happy, Happy Birthday Baby", did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique, high [[soprano]] voice was not suited to the genre.

After her composition "[[Put It Off Until Tomorrow]]", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, "Dumb Blonde" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by "Something Fishy", which went to number 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hello I'm Dolly – Dolly's first solo album 1967|date=February 13, 1967|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/hello-im-dolly-album/|publisher=Dolly Parton|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref>

==Music career==
===1967–1975: Country music success===
[[File:Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton in 1969]]
In 1967, musician and country music entertainer [[Porter Wagoner]] invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television program ''The Porter Wagoner Show'', and in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]", released in late 1967, reached the country Top{{spaces}}10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted Top{{spaces}}10 singles for the pair.

Parton's first solo single for RCA Victor, "[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the next two years, none of her solo efforts{{snd}}even "[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]", which later became a standard{{snd}}were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|date=November 18, 1966|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=Dolly Parton|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.

By 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' "[[Mule Skinner Blues]]", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, "[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits{{snd}}including her signature song "[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]" (number four, 1971){{snd}}in addition to her duets. Top{{spaces}}20 singles included "The Right Combination" and "Burning the Midnight Oil" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); "Lost Forever in Your Kiss" (with Wagoner), "[[Touch Your Woman]]" (1972), "[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]" and "Travelin' Man" (1973).<ref name="DollyPartonEntertainment.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>

Although her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]". Released in late 1973, the song topped the country chart in February 1974 and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100 (it eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated. He helped produce her records through 1975.<ref name=allMusicGuide>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1759|pure_url=yes}} Dolly Parton profile], Allmusic.com; accessed March 31, 2014.</ref> The pair continued to release duet albums, their final release being 1975's ''[[Say Forever You'll Be Mine]]''.<ref name="officialmusicwebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton official music website|work=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>

In 1974, her song, "[[I Will Always Love You]]", written about her professional break from Wagoner, went to number one on the country chart. Around the same time, [[Elvis Presley]] indicated that he wanted to record the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song recorded by Presley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmt.com/artists/news/1535871/20060707/presley_elvis.jhtml|title=Dolly Parton Reflects on Her Greatest Moments|access-date=March 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012164144/http://cmt.com/artists/news/1535871/20060707/presley_elvis.jhtml|archive-date=October 12, 2007}}, cmt.com; July 7, 2006.</ref> Parton refused. That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years. Parton had three solo singles reach number one on the country chart in 1974 ("Jolene", "I Will Always Love You" and "[[Love Is Like a Butterfly (song)|Love Is Like a Butterfly]]"), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, "[[Please Don't Stop Loving Me]]". In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she had composed both "Jolene" and "I Will Always Love You" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson "Buddy, that was a good night." Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with "[[The Bargain Store]]".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts{{snd}}The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>

===1976–1986: Pop transition===
[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]
Between 1974 and 1980, Parton had a series of country hits, with eight singles reaching number one. Her influence on pop culture is reflected by the many performers covering her songs, including mainstream and crossover artists such as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]].<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

Parton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs – the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]" and "[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]" – and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest ... First Gathering – 18th Solo Album|date=February 2, 1977|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=Dolly Parton|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single "[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]" made much of an impression on the pop charts.

After ''New Harvest''{{'s}} disappointing crossover performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]]'', became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first Top{{spaces}}10 single on the pop chart (no.{{spaces}}3). A second single, the double A-sided "[[Two Doors Down (Dolly Parton song)|Two Doors Down]]"/"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top{{spaces}}20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|date=November 6, 2014 |url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=Dolly Parton|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Dolly Parton and Burnett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With [[Carol Burnett]], 1979]]
In 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album. She continued to have hits with "[[Heartbreaker (Dolly Parton song)|Heartbreaker]]" (1978), "[[Baby I'm Burning]]" (1979) and "[[You're the Only One (Dolly Parton song)|You're the Only One]]" (1979){{spaces}}all of which charted in the pop [[Top&nbsp;40]] and topped the country chart. "[[Sweet Summer Lovin']]" (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top{{spaces}}10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again''{{'s}} release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher... Special|television special]], and her own joint special with [[Carol Burnett]] on CBS, ''[[Dolly & Carol in Nashville]]''.

Parton served as one of three co-hosts (along with [[Roy Clark]] and [[Glen Campbell]]) on the CBS special ''Fifty Years of Country Music''. In 1979, Parton hosted the [[NBC]] special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].
Her commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written "[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]]", "[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]", and "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9{{spaces}}to{{spaces}}5]]", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name="allMusicGuide"/> She had another Top{{spaces}}10 single that year with "Making Plans", a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|album with Porter Wagoner]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|date=May 13, 2014|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|website=Dolly Parton|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> released as part of a lawsuit settlement between the pair.

[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu|Honolulu, Hawaii]], 1983]]
The theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9{{spaces}}to{{spaces}}5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], not only reached number one on the country chart{{snd}}in February 1981 it reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top{{spaces}}10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had twelve Top{{spaces}}10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of "I Will Always Love You", from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top{{spaces}}50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

In the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with "[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]", "[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]", "God Won't Get You" (1984), "[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), "[[Don't Call It Love (song)#Dolly Parton cover|Don't Call It Love]]" (1985) and "[[Think About Love]]" (1986) all reaching the country Top{{spaces}}10 ("Tennessee Homesick Blues" and "Think About Love" reached number one; "Real Love" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit). However, RCA Records did not renew her contract after it expired in 1986, and she signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1987.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

===1987–2005: Country and bluegrass period===
Along with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], she released ''[[Trio (1987 album)|Trio]]'' (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the Top{{spaces}}10 on ''Billboard''{{'s}} Top{{spaces}}200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top{{spaces}}10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]", which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]]'' (1987), including the single "[[The River Unbroken]]", it ended up a commercial let-down, causing Parton to focus on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in "[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]" and "[[Yellow Roses (Dolly Parton song)|Yellow Roses]]". Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>

[[File:Dolly Parton with square red earrings.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dolly Parton at a recording session {{circa|1989}}]]
A duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], "[[Rockin' Years]]" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded "I Will Always Love You" for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart.

Parton's recorded music during the mid-to-late-1990s remained steady and somewhat eclectic. Her 1995 re-recording of "I Will Always Love You" (performed as a duet with [[Vince Gill]]), from her album ''[[Something Special (Dolly Parton album)|Something Special]]'' won the Country Music Association's [[Country Music Association Awards#Awards by year|Vocal Event of the Year Award]].

Her recording of Stevens' "[[Peace Train]]" was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching ''Billboard's ''dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album ''[[Hungry Again]]'' was made up entirely of her own compositions. Although neither of the album's two singles, "(Why Don't More Women Sing) Honky Tonk Songs" and "Salt in my Tears", charted, videos for both songs received significant airplay on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]. A second and more contemporary collaboration with Harris and Ronstadt, ''[[Trio II]]'', was released in early 1999. Its cover of Neil Young's song "[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].

The third, ''[[Halos & Horns]]'' (2002) included a bluegrass version of the [[Led Zeppelin]] song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". In 2005, she released ''[[Those Were the Days (Dolly Parton album)|Those Were The Days]]'' consisting of her interpretations of hits from the [[folk-rock]] era of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]", "[[Where Do the Children Play?]]", "[[Crimson and Clover]]", and "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]"<ref name=bio/>

|quote   = The way I look and the way I looked then was a country girl's idea of glam, just like I wrote in my "Backwoods Barbie" song. People wanted me to change, they thought I looked cheap. But I patterned my look after the town tramp. Everybody said, "She's trash." And in my little girl mind, I thought, "Well, that's what I'm going to be when I grow up." It was really like a look I was after. I wasn't a natural beauty. So, I just like to look the way I look. I'm so outgoing inside in my personality, that I need the way I look to match all of that.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
Parton, though influenced by big name stars, often credits much of her inspiration to her family and community. On her own mother Parton, in her 2020 book ''Songteller: My Life in Lyrics'', wrote "So it was just natural for my mom to always be singing. My mother had that old-timey voice, and she used to sing all these songs that were brought over from the Old World. They were English, Irish, Welsh, folk songs where people tell stories." Parton calls her mother's voice "haunting". "Lord you would feel it", she wrote.<ref name="Goeres">{{cite web |last=Goeres |first=Kelsey |title=Dolly Parton's Biggest Influences Weren't Big 'Stars' |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/dolly-parton-biggest-influences-werent-big-stars.html/ |website=Showbiz Cheat Sheet |access-date=August 2, 2021 |date=April 6, 2021}}</ref> Her biggest influence however was her Aunt Dorothy Jo: "People often ask me who my influences were, they think I'm going to say some big names, and there were a few 'stars' I was impressed with. But my hero was my aunt Dorothy Jo. Mama's baby sister. She was not only an evangelist, she played banjo, she played guitar, and she wrote some great songs."<ref name="Goeres"/> Of course, fellow singers also had an impact on Parton, describing [[George Jones]] as her "all time favorite singer",<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Dolly Parton, Merle Haggard, Other Hall of Famers Mourn George Jones |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/1559875/dolly-parton-merle-haggard-other-hall-of-famers-mourn-george-jones/ |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 2, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> and recognizing her love for other artists such as [[Kitty Wells]], [[Roy Acuff]], and [[Rose Maddox]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goeres |first1=Kelsey |title=The Artist Dolly Parton Loved to Listen to Growing up Because She Sang About 'Defending the Women' |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/artist-dolly-parton-loved-listen-growing-up-because-sang-about-defending-women.html/ |website=Showbiz Cheat Sheet |access-date=August 2, 2021 |date=March 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Interview: Dolly Parton Talks to Tim McGraw About All Sorts! |work=Lyric Magazine |url=https://www.lyricmagazine.co.uk/interview-dolly-parton-talks-to-tim-mcgraw-about-her-music-her-acting-career-her-influences-and-her-relationship-with-god/ |access-date=August 2, 2021 |date=July 22, 2021 |archive-date=August 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210802171507/https://www.lyricmagazine.co.uk/interview-dolly-parton-talks-to-tim-mcgraw-about-her-music-her-acting-career-her-influences-and-her-relationship-with-god/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Although her first attempt, the television variety show ''[[Dolly!]]'' (1976–77), had high ratings, it lasted only one season, with Parton requesting to be released from her contract because of the stress it was causing on her [[vocal cords]]. (She later tried a second television variety show, also titled ''[[Dolly (1987 TV series)|Dolly]]'' (1987–88); it too lasted only one season).

In her first feature film, Parton portrayed a secretary in a leading role with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] in the comedy film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9{{spaces}}to{{spaces}}5]]'' (1980).

She has commented on Dean's romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to surprise her, and sometimes even writes poems for her.{{sfn|Parton|1994|p=214}} In 2011, Parton said, "We're really very proud of our marriage.

On May 6, 2016, Parton announced that she and Dean would renew their vows in honor of their 50th wedding anniversary later in the month.<ref>{{cite news|date=May 6, 2016|last=Fisher|first=Luchina|work=ABC News|title=Dolly Parton Tying the Knot Again for 50th Anniversary|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dolly-parton-tying-knot-50th-anniversary/story?id=38869061|access-date=May 6, 2016}}</ref>

While Parton has never had children, she and Dean helped raise several of her younger siblings in Nashville, leading her nieces and nephews to refer to them as "Uncle Peepaw" and "Aunt Granny"; the latter a moniker that later lent its name to one of Parton's [[Dollywood]] restaurants. 
Parton is also the godmother of singer-songwriter and actress [[Miley Cyrus]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20184725,00.html|first=Brian|last=Orloff|title=Dolly Parton Calls Miley Cyrus a 'Little Elvis'|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 17, 2008|access-date=February 12, 2012|archive-date=January 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106000415/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20184725,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Faith===
Parton says that she is a committed Christian, which has influenced many of her musical releases.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Hanna |first1=Philippa |title=The Christian faith of Dolly Parton |url=https://www.premierchristianity.com/opinion/the-christian-faith-of-dolly-parton/13267.article |access-date=April 27, 2023 |website=Premier Christianity |language=en}}</ref>

She talked about her liberal approach to faith in the January 2024 issue of New Humanist magazine. "I wouldn't even say I'm religious, though I grew up with that background. But I have a lot of faith in myself and I've been so blessed to have been around great people my whole life, my Uncle Bill and my family being supportive, and all the people I met along the way."

'''Donna Ulisse''' is an American [[country music]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] singer-songwriter. Signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1991, she released her debut album, ''Trouble at the Door'', that year and two singles which charted on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart. She appeared on national TV shows ''[[Hee Haw]]'', ''[[Nashville Now]]'', ''[[Crook & Chase]]'', and NBC's ''[[Hot Country Nights]]''.

Ulisse's debut album ''Trouble at the Door'' charted the singles "Things Are Mostly Fine" and "When Was the Last Time".<ref name="whitburn"/> The former received a positive review in ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine which stated that she "generates a soothing ballad quilted with a powerful force of emotion and inspiration".<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/90s/1990/CB-1990-12-08.pdf | title=Reviews | journal=Cash Box | pages=22 | date=December 8, 1990}}</ref>

After leaving Atlantic Records in the early 1990’s, Ulisse took some time off and concentrated on song writing, however she did make some appearances. She returned in 2007, this time recording bluegrass music, with a new album ''When I Look Back'' on Hadley Music Group. Ulisse toured with her band The Poor Mountain Boys performing at festivals and concert venues. From 2007-2015, she released nine albums with Hadley Music Group. 

She won the award for 2016 [[International Bluegrass Music Association]]’s Songwriter of the Year and in 2017 she won International Bluegrass Music Association's song of the Year with "I Am A Drifter", co-written with Marc Rossi. Ulisse landed SPBGMA's Songwriter of the Year in the same year. In 2017, she signed with Mountain Home Music Company, and released her eleventh album ''Breakin' Easy'', later that year, produced by [[Doyle Lawson]].

In 2019, Ulisse signed with a new bluegrass label, Billy Blue Records, and released an album, ''Time For Love'', on November 1, 2019.

Ulisse released her second album and her thirteenth album overall, ''Livin' Large'', for Billy Blue Records on February 25, 2022.

Ulisse released her third album with Billy Blue Records, ''Mountain Lily'', on February 23, 2024.

'''Douglas James Kershaw''' (born January 24, 1936<ref name="fiddle" /><ref name="McCall-p263" />) is an American [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]] player, singer and songwriter from [[Louisiana]]. Active since 1948, he began his career as part of the duo [[Rusty and Doug]], along with his brother, [[Rusty Kershaw]]. He had an extensive solo career that included fifteen albums and singles that charted on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. He is also a member of the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]], being inducted in 2009.

== Early life ==
Born in an unincorporated community called Tiel Ridge in [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron Parish]], Kershaw spoke [[Louisiana French]] and did not learn English until the age of eight. By that time, he had mastered the fiddle, which he played from the age of five, and was on his way to teaching himself to play 28 instruments.<ref name = "CMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529012212/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |title=Doug Kershaw Bio |publisher=Cmt.com |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref> His first gig was at a local bar, the Bucket of Blood, where he was accompanied by his mother on guitar.<ref name="LouisianaRocks">{{cite book|last1=Aswell|first1=Tom|title=Louisiana Rocks!: The True Genesis of Rock and Roll|date=2013|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781455607839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSHTGsnI8skC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22Bucket+of+Blood%22&pg=PA222|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>

Kershaw became interested in Cajun music during parties his parents would host on the family's [[houseboat]] in Louisiana, where he first heard Cajun bands playing the music.

=="Doug and Rusty"==
Doug grew up surrounded by [[Cajun music|Cajun]] fiddle and [[accordion]] music. After teaching his brother, Rusty, to play guitar, he formed a band, the Continental Playboys, with Rusty and older brother Nelson "Peewee" Kershaw in 1948.<ref name="LouisianaRocks"/> With the departure of Peewee from the group, in the early 1950s, [[Rusty & Doug]] continued to perform as a duo. In 1955, when Kershaw was nineteen, he and Rusty performed on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' [[KWKH]] radio broadcast in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana.<ref name="Stabler-p233">{{cite book|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|edition=3rd|page=233|isbn=978-0312264871}}</ref> The two also performed at the WWVA Jamboree (later renamed [[Jamboree U.S.A.]]), in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], West Virginia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dregni|first1=Michael|title=Rockabilly: The Twang Heard 'Round the World: The Illustrated History|date=2011|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9780760340622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06VWZ69WBAEC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22WWVA+jamboree%22&pg=PA144|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>

Although the brothers initially sang in French, [[J. D. "Jay" Miller]], owner of the [[Feature Records]] label, persuaded them to incorporate songs in English into their repertoire. In 1955, Doug and Rusty recorded their first single, "So Lovely, Baby." Released on the Hickory label, the tune went to number 14 on the country music charts. Later that same year, Doug and Rusty were invited to become members of the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' cast. The Kershaws appeared at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and became regular members of the Opry cast the following year.<ref name = "CMT" /><ref>{{cite web

Despite the demands of his music career, Doug enrolled in [[McNeese State University]], in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], where he earned an [[undergraduate degree]] in Mathematics. At the peak of their early career, in 1958, Doug and Rusty both enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. They devoted their attention to the military until their discharge three years later.<ref name="LouisianaRocks"/>

== "Louisiana Man" and solo career ==
After fulfilling their military obligation, the two brothers recorded "[[Louisiana Man]]", an autobiographical song that Doug had written while in the Army. The song not only sold millions of copies but over the years has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music.<ref name="Woodstra-p255">{{cite book|last=Woodstra|first=Chris|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings|publisher=Backbeat Books|edition=1st|year=1997|page=255|isbn=978-0879304751}}</ref> The song was eventually [[cover version|covered]] by more than 800 artists.

There were three albums released by the duo on [[Hickory Records]], only one being released before they split up. The first was ''Rusty and Doug Sing Louisiana Man'' (LPM 103) in 1961. ''Kershaw (Genus Cambarus)'' (LPS 163) was released in 1972 and was a double LP. ''Louisiana Man'' (HR 4506) was the final Hickory album, released in 1974. By 1964, the brothers had elected to go their separate ways. It took another three years before Kershaw signed a songwriters' contract with BMI, in 1967.

In June 1969, Kershaw made his first network television appearance on the debut of the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash Show]]''.<ref name="LouisianaRocks"/> After watching Kershaw's ''Johnny Cash Show'' performance as an eight-year-old boy, [[Mark O'Connor]] became inspired to learn to play the fiddle.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/11/19/mark-oconnors-art-fiddling-with-the-best/ad489226-573c-4281-b521-c7aff4a63e5a/ |title=Mark O'Connor's Art: Fiddling With The Best |author=Himes, Geoffrey |work=washingtonpost.com |access-date=5 May 2022 }}</ref> He capped the year with a week-long engagement at the New York City's [[Fillmore East]] as opening act for [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Derek and the Dominos]]. While it seemed to many rock and pop fans that Kershaw had appeared out of nowhere, he had already sold more than 18 million copies of the records he had made in the early '60s with his brother, Rusty. "Louisiana Man" had been a Top 10 country hit in 1961 and its follow-up, "Diggy Liggy Lo", had done almost as well. His performance in front of a national audience led to [[Warner Bros. Records]] signing him to a long-term contract.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard De La Font Agency, Inc: Doug Kershaw|url=http://delafont.com/music_acts/E/doug-kershaw.htm|publisher=Delafont.com|access-date=2014-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709010841/http://delafont.com/music_acts/E/doug-kershaw.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 1969, he performed at the Newport folk festival along with Joni Mitchell, Arlo Guthrie, Ramblin Jack Elliott, Big Mama Thornton, and Mimi Fariña, among others. Newcomers that year were Don McLean, James Taylor, and Jerry Jeff Walker.

This is where he heard mandolinist [[Bill Monroe]], the "founding father" of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and his band ''the Blue Grass Boys''.

Lawson became interested in playing the mandolin around the age of eleven so his father borrowed a mandolin from Willis Byrd, a family friend and fellow musician. Doyle taught himself how to play the mandolin by listening to the radio and records, and watching an occasional TV show.<ref name=aj /> Later Lawson learned to play the [[guitar]] and [[banjo]] as well.<ref name="McNeil2013" />

In 1963, aged 18 or 19, Lawson went to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to play the banjo with [[Jimmy Martin|Jimmy Martin and the Sunny Mountain Boys]].<ref name="WolffDuane2000">{{cite book|author1=Kurt Wolff|author2=Orla Duane|title=Country Music: The Rough Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&pg=PA228|year=2000|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-534-4|pages=228–}}</ref>

'''Earl Eugene Scruggs''' (January 6, 1924&nbsp;– March 28, 2012) was an American musician noted for popularizing a three-finger [[banjo]] picking style, now called "[[Scruggs style]]", which is a defining characteristic of [[bluegrass music]]. His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.

Scruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in [[Bill Monroe]]'s band, the Blue Grass Boys. "Bluegrass" eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and recording classic hits such as "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1948 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member [[Lester Flatt]] resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo [[Flatt and Scruggs]]. Scruggs' banjo instrumental "[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]" was recorded in December 1949 and released in March 1950. The song became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. The song won two [[Grammy Award]]s and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' [[National Recording Registry]] of works of unusual merit.

Flatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit "[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]", the theme music for the television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''—the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the [[Billboard charts]]. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 [[Single (music)|singles]]. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.
 
Scruggs received four Grammy awards, a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and a [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]]. He became a member of the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] and was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and named, as a duo, number 24 on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]'s "40 Greatest Men of Country Music". Scruggs was awarded a [[National Heritage Fellowship]] by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the highest honor in the [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional arts in the United States. Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. After Scruggs' death in 2012 at age 88, the [[Cleveland County Courthouse (Shelby, North Carolina)|Earl Scruggs Center]] was founded in Shelby, North Carolina, near his birthplace with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors. The center is a $5.5 million facility that features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students.

==Development==
[[File:Finger_picks_(1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.64|alt=Finger picks|Finger picks on thumb, index and middle finger]]
Scruggs is noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called "[[Scruggs style]]" that has become a defining characteristic of [[bluegrass music]].<ref name="trishka">{{cite book |last1=Trischka |first1=Tony |title=Banjo song book |date=1977 |publisher=Oak Publications |location=New York |isbn=0825601975}}</ref> Prior to Scruggs, most banjo players used the [[clawhammer|frailing or clawhammer technique]], which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail. This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string.<ref name="clawhammer-video">{{cite web |last1=Laird |first1=Brad |title=Basic Clawhammer Lick |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv-nYYJO_5k |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/vv-nYYJO_5k |archive-date=December 11, 2021 |url-status=live |website=youtube.com |publisher=Free Banjo Videos.com |access-date=March 2, 2017 |date=February 13, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to [[classical guitar technique]].<ref name="brown-paul" /> Scruggs style also involves using [[Fingerpick|picks]] on three digits ''(see photo)'', each plucking individual strings—downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence. When done skillfully and in rapid sequence, the style allows any digit (though usually the thumb) to play a melody, while the other two digits play [[arpeggio]]s of the melody line. The use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack, creating an exciting effect, described by ''The New York Times'' as "like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roof".<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news |last1=Lehman-Haupt |first1=Christopher |title=Earl Scruggs Dies at 88; Shaped Bluegrass Sound |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/arts/music/earl-scruggs-bluegrass-banjo-player-dies-at-88.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 29, 2012 |page=B17 |access-date=May 4, 2013}}</ref> This departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrument—a promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedian's prop—and popularized the instrument in several genres of music.<ref name="associated">{{cite web |agency=Associated Press |title=Bluegrass, banjo legend Earl Scruggs dies at 88 |url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2012/03/bluegrass_banjo_legend_earl_sc.html |website=blog.al.com |publisher=Alabama Media Group |access-date=March 1, 2017 |date=March 28, 2012}}</ref><ref name="telegraph">{{cite web |title=Earl Scruggs/Obituary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9174642/Earl-Scruggs.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9174642/Earl-Scruggs.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |website=telegraph.co.uk |date=March 29, 2012 |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |access-date=February 9, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="instruction-book">{{cite book |last1=Scruggs |first1=Earl |title=Earl Scruggs and the 5-string banjo/Foreword by Nat Winston |date=2005 |publisher=Hal Leonard |location=Milwaukee, Wis. |isbn=0634060422 |edition=Rev. and enhanced ed.

Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he said the three-finger style was the most common way to play the five-string banjo in his hometown in western North Carolina.<ref name="brown-paul" /> An early influence was a local banjoist, [[Snuffy Jenkins|DeWitt "Snuffy" Jenkins]], who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian [[Tony Trischka]], "Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it".<ref name="trishka" /> At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called "Reuben" and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. "That excited me to no end", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling "I've got it".<ref name="brown-paul" /><ref name="websitebio" /> From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jonassen |first1=Mikael |title=The Impact of Earl Scruggs on the Five String Banjo |url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/54135/Masteroppgave.pdf |website=Duo.uio.no |access-date=June 2, 2018}}</ref> [[Don Reno]], an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins.<ref name="willis" /> Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it "a syncopated roll that was quite different."<ref name="willis" /><ref name="bader-brian">{{cite web |last1=Bader |first1=Brian |title="Foggy Mountain Breakdown"—Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs (1949) Added to the National Registry: 2004 |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/FoggyMtBreakdown2.pdf |website=loc.gov |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> On the subject, [[John Hartford]] said, "Here's the way I feel about it. Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time—maybe since 1840. But it's my feeling that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it."<ref name="willis" />

==With Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys==
At age 15, Scruggs played in a group called [[The Morris Brothers]] for a few months, but quit to work in a factory making sewing thread in the Lily Textile Mill near his home in North Carolina.<ref name="cooperbook">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=Peter |title=Johnny's Cash and Charley's Pride |date=2017 |publisher=Spring House |location=Nashville |isbn=978-1-940611-70-9 |page=48}}</ref> He worked there about two years, earning 40 cents an hour, until the draft restriction for World War II was lifted in 1945, at which time he returned to music, performing with "Lost John Miller and his Allied Kentuckians" on WNOX in Knoxville.<ref name="willis" /> About this time an opening to play with Bill Monroe became available.

[[File:MonroeBrothers.jpg|thumb|Bill and Charlie Monroe, c. 1936]]

[[Bill Monroe]], 13 years older than Scruggs, was prominent in country music at the time. His career started with the "Monroe Brothers", a duo with his brother [[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]]. Bill sang the high tenor harmony parts, a sound called "high lonesome", for which he became noted.<ref name="jargon">{{cite web |title=High Lonesome Sound |url=http://www.jargondatabase.com/Category/Music/Bluegrass-Jargon/High-Lonesome-Sound |website=jargondatabase.com |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name="bluegrass">{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Bluegrass Music |url=http://bluegrassheritage.org/history-bluegrass-music/ |website=bluegrassheritage.org |publisher=Bluegrass Heritage Foundation |access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref> The brothers split up in 1938 and Bill, a native of "the Bluegrass State" of Kentucky, formed a new group called Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys. They first played on the Opry in 1939 and soon became a popular touring band featuring a vocalist named [[Lester Flatt]].<ref name="bluegrass" /> The name "[[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]" stuck and eventually became the eponym for this entire genre of [[country music]] and Monroe became known as "the father of bluegrass".<ref name="bill-monroe-bio">{{cite web |title=Bill Monroe Biography |url=http://www.biography.com/people/bill-monroe-21369943#synopsis |website=biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=February 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222194035/http://www.biography.com/people/bill-monroe-21369943#synopsis |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

When Scruggs was 21, Monroe was looking for a banjo player for his group, because [[David "Stringbean" Akeman]] was quitting. At the time, banjo players often functioned in the band as comedians, and the instrument was often held as a prop—their clawhammer playing was almost inaudible.<ref name="washington">{{cite news |last1=McArdle |first1=Terence |title=Bluegrass musician Earl Scruggs, 88, dies |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/bluegrass-musician-earl-scruggs-88-dies/2012/03/28/gIQAcTyqhS_story.html |access-date=February 1, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> Monroe, along with band member Lester Flatt, auditioned several banjo players who had the same traditional playing style as Akeman. When Scruggs auditioned for them at the Tulane Hotel in Nashville, Flatt said, "I was thrilled. It was so different! I had never heard that kind of banjo picking."<ref name="willis" /><ref name="tulane">{{cite web |title=Hotel Tulane, Nashville, Tenn., circa 1917 |url=http://digital.library.nashville.org/cdm/ref/collection/nr/id/2263 |website=digital.library.nashville.org |publisher=Nashville Public Library Digital Collections |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref> Scruggs joined Monroe in late 1945, earning $50 a week.<ref name="nytimes" /> After they accepted Scruggs as one of the Blue Grass Boys, the roster consisted of Bill Monroe (vocals/mandolin), Lester Flatt (guitar/vocals), Earl Scruggs (banjo), Chubby Wise (fiddle), and Howard Watts (stage name Cedric Rainwater) on bass. This group of men became the prototype of what a bluegrass band would become.<ref name="cooper">{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Peter |title=1924–2012: Earl Scruggs |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/218637258 |agency=Gannett |newspaper=Tennessean |date=March 29, 2012 |pages=A1–3}}</ref>

With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs performed on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 [[Chevrolet]] from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off".<ref name="willis" /> The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night.<ref name="fresh-air">{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Terry |title=Earl Scruggs: The 2003 Fresh Air Interview |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/30/149612506/earl-scruggs-the-2003-fresh-air-interview |website=npr.org |publisher=National Public Radio (NPR) |access-date=March 11, 2017 |date=March 29, 2012}}</ref> Scruggs said of Monroe that "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there".<ref name="willis" /> Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years.<ref name="fresh-air" /> He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. Flatt had also made up his mind to leave, but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice, but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.<ref name="nytimes" />

==Flatt and Scruggs==
In 1948, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs formed the duo [[Flatt and Scruggs]] and chose the name "the Foggy Mountain Boys" for their backing band. The name came from a song by the [[Carter Family]] called "Foggy Mountain Top" that the band used as a theme song at the time.<ref name="nytimes" /><ref name="fellowship" /> Flatt later acknowledged that they consciously tried to make their sound different from Monroe's group. In the spring of 1949, their second Mercury recording session yielded the classic "Foggy Mountain Breakdown", released on 78 RPM [[phonograph record]]s that were in use at the time.<ref name="78rpmyale">{{cite web |title=The History of 78 RPM Recordings |url=https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/historyof78rpms |website=web.library.yale.edu |publisher=Yale University Library: Irving S.

On September 24, 1962, the duo recorded "[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]" for the TV show ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.

By the end of the 1960s, Scruggs was getting bored with repetition of the classic bluegrass fare.<ref name="rosenberg" /> By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, "I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed".<ref name="associated" /> Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts.<ref name="billboard" /> Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, [[Bob Johnston]], instead of their long-time producer [[Don Law]].<ref name="rosenberg" /> Johnston had produced [[Bob Dylan]]'s records.

Neither Flatt nor Scruggs spoke to each other for the next ten years—until 1979 when Flatt was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to his bedside. The two men talked for more than an hour. Even though Flatt's voice was barely above a whisper, he spoke of a reunion. Scruggs answered yes, but told Flatt they would talk when he was better.

==Banjos==
In the late 1950s Scruggs met with Bill Nelson, one of the owners of the [[Vega Company|Vega Musical Instrument Company]] in Boston, to sign a contract to design and endorse a new banjo to be called "The Earl Scruggs Model".<ref name="vega-banjo" /> The company had made banjos since before 1912 and already had a [[Pete Seeger]] model.<ref name="vega-catalogs">{{cite web |title=Vintage Vega Catalogs in PDF Format |url=http://www.musicmansteve.com/catalogs/VegaCatalogsEnew.htm |website=musicamnsteve.com |publisher=Music Man Steve |access-date=February 25, 2017}}</ref> There would be four Scruggs models in the top-of-the-line banjos they produced. It was the first time a prominent bluegrass banjo player had played any brand other than a [[Gibson (guitar company)|Gibson]].<ref name="rosenberg" /> Scruggs participated in Vega's marketing campaign that claimed that the banjo was constructed to Scruggs's design specifications, which was true, but the finished product fell short of his expectations.<ref name="vega-banjo" /> According to Scruggs's friend and fellow banjoist, Curtis McPeake, Scruggs never cared for it. McPeake stated, "They were good banjos, they just wasn't [''sic''] what Earl wanted to play."<ref name="vega-banjo" /> Scruggs continued to perform and record using his Gibson Granada. The Vega company was sold to the C.F. Martin company in 1970, and the contract was dissolved.<ref name="vega-banjo" />

In 1984, Gibson produced what Scruggs had wanted—the Gibson "Earl Scruggs Standard", a replica of his personal 1934 Gibson Granada RB Mastertone banjo, number 9584-3.<ref name="granada">{{cite web |title=1934 RB Granada |url=http://www.banjophiles.com/SerNumData/9584-3.html |website=banjophiles.org |publisher=Banjophiles |access-date=March 7, 2017}}</ref> This banjo had been changed over its long existence and the only remaining original parts were the rim, the tone ring and the resonator (the wooden back of the instrument).<ref name="granada" /> The banjo was originally gold-plated, but the gold had long-since worn off and had been replaced with nickel hardware.

==Louise Scruggs==
{{Main|Louise Scruggs}}
On December 14, 1946, 19-year-old Anne Louise Certain attended the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She went backstage after the performance to meet some of the performers, including Scruggs, who had been with Bill Monroe's band about a year at that time. Scruggs and Certain began dating and fell in love. They were married about a year and a half later in April, 1948.<ref name="cooper" /> When Flatt and Scruggs formed the new group, Scruggs had done most of the bookings for the band, but being on the road for hours in a car and stopping at a phone booth to communicate with venues, often at odd hours, was difficult. Louise had a business aptitude and began helping by doing the phone work.<ref name="vega-banjo" /> She eventually became the booking agent and ultimately the group's manager, Nashville's first woman to become prominent in that role.<ref name="cooper" /> Her acumen and skills in the job were prescient. She turned the band into TV personalities and helped propel them into what today would be called rock stars, touring with [[Joan Baez]] and performing at the prestigious [[Newport Folk Festival]].<ref name="Louise_CMT">{{cite web |title=Music Industry Pioneer Louise Scruggs Dies |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1523089/music-industry-pioneer-louise-scruggs-dies/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110065909/http://www.cmt.com/news/1523089/music-industry-pioneer-louise-scruggs-dies/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 10, 2015 |website=[[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] |publisher=Viacom International |access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> She recruited noted artist [[Thomas B.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Scruggs received word that his mother, Lula, had suffered a stroke and heart attack in North Carolina. The only flight available from Nashville involved such a series of connecting cities that it was not feasible to fly. Scruggs and his wife, with sons Gary and Randy, decided to drive all night from Nashville to see her when they were involved in an automobile accident just east of Knoxville about 3 a.m. October 2.<ref name="mother_dies">{{cite news |title=Opry Star's Mother Dies in North Carolina |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8920695/car_wreck_was_sept_1955/ |newspaper=The Tennessean |date=October 24, 1955 |page=20}}</ref> Their car was hit by a drunk driver, a [[Fort Campbell]] soldier who had pulled out from a side road into their path, then fled the scene after the collision.<ref name="patrolmen">{{cite news |title=Patrolmen Seek GI's Indictment After 2 Injured |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8920776/the_tennessean/ |newspaper=The Tennessean |date=October 4, 1955 |page=10}}</ref> The children were not hurt, but Earl suffered a fractured pelvis and dislocations of both hips, which would plague him for years, and Louise had been thrown into the windshield, receiving multiple lacerations.<ref name="willis" /> They were flown to a Nashville hospital where Scruggs remained hospitalized for about two months.

While still in the recovery room after this hip operation, Scruggs suffered a heart attack; he was returned to the operating room later the same day for quintuple coronary bypass surgery.<ref name="quintuple">{{cite news |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Thomas |title=Scruggs has surgery |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/113395059/?terms=%22Earl%2BScruggs%22%2B%2B%2Bsurgery |newspaper=The Tennessean |date=October 16, 1996 |page=4B}}</ref> Despite the dire circumstances, he recovered and returned to his musical career.

Scruggs was involved in a solo plane crash in October 1975. He was flying his 1974 Cessna Skyhawk II aircraft home to Nashville around midnight from a performance of the Earl Scruggs Revue in Murray, Kentucky. On his landing approach he was enveloped in dense fog and overshot the runway at [[Cornelia Fort Airpark]] in Nashville and the plane flipped over. The automatic crash alert system in the plane did not function, and Scruggs remained without help for five hours. He crawled about 150 feet from the wreckage with a broken ankle, broken nose, and facial lacerations, afraid that the plane might catch fire. His family was driving home from the same concert and was unaware of the crash, but his niece became worried when he did not arrive. She called police at about 4 a.m., and they went to the airport, where they heard Scruggs' cries for help from a field near the runway.<ref name="jerry-thompson" /> He recovered, but was in a wheelchair for a few weeks, including for the premiere of the Scruggs documentary ''Banjoman'' at the Kennedy Center.<ref name="jerry-thompson" />

Every January for many years, Scruggs' birthday was celebrated by a party at his home on Franklin Road in Nashville. After a buffet dinner, guests would gather in the living room for an informal "pickin' party" where some of country music's best known stars would sing and play with no one around but family and close friends.<ref name="cooper" /> The attendees over the years included [[Tom T.

He is the best there ever was and the best there ever will be."<ref name="nytimes" />

At age 88, Earl Scruggs died from natural causes on the morning of March 28, 2012, in a Nashville hospital.<ref name="associated" /> His funeral was held on Sunday, April 1, 2012, at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, Tennessee, and was open to the public.

'''Emily Burns Strayer''' ({{née}} '''Erwin''', previously '''Robison'''; born August 16, 1972) is an American songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist, and a founding member of the [[Country music|country]] band [[the Chicks]], formerly known as the Dixie Chicks. Strayer plays [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, lap steel, [[Upright bass|bass]], [[mandolin]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]], [[piano]], and [[sitar]]. Initially in her career with the Chicks, she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals, but within her role in the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], she took on the role of lead vocalist.

==Early life==

Emily Erwin was born in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the suburban town of [[Addison, Texas]], on the northern edge of [[Dallas]], where she was raised with her two older sisters, Julia and [[Martie Maguire|Martha]]. Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha (later nicknamed Martie) shared, and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school.

Emily began playing the violin at age seven, and the [[banjo]] at age ten, afterward learning all the [[string instruments]] she could find.<ref name="Malkin">Malkin, Nina [http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html "A Little About Martie"], Dixie Chicks Henhouse (Retrieved December 31, 2007).</ref> Years later, Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle, and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument, she forced Emily to learn something else.<ref>{{cite video | title=[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]] |date=2006 | medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[The Weinstein Company]]}}</ref> Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo, by reading books to teach herself the [[chord progressions]].<ref name="Malkin"/>

From 1984–1989, Jane Frost (Director of the [[Patsy Montana|Patsy Montana Museum]] and the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]]) remembers watching the sisters mature, teaming up with schoolmates Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]. The foursome were touring in a teenage [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group they named the Blue Night Express, in part because of the amount of traveling they had to do to reach far away festivals, frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night. They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others. The sisters were said to have an "almost obsessive" interest in [[busking]] at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals.<ref name=Frost>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Jane|title=Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS, Early 1980s|url=http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|website=The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page|date=July 15, 1999|access-date=December 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002233114/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|archive-date=October 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Faraway Hills">[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html "Sharon Gilchrist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182257/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, Faraway Hills (Retrieved February 12, 2008).</ref> After Martie graduated from secondary school at [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)|Greenhill School]] with Emily still completing her studies, both remained active in the bluegrass scene.

==The Chicks==
[[File:Emily Robison with the Dixie Chicks 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|left|With the Dixie Chicks; 1998]]

In 1989, after years of attending [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[festivals]] and [[busking]] where they could, Emily joined her sister Martie, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and [[upright bass]] player [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]]. Frost, again, recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together. Martie felt they could do well. Robin said, ".. It's going to be a 'hot' band," to which Emily responded, "I give it six months, and if we aren't making money by then, I'm out of here!".<ref name="Frost" /> Strayer was shy, and the youngest member of the group. She had enjoyed playing throughout school, but was at an age where she was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the [[United States Air Force Academy]].<ref name="Clark">Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml "Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191833/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml |date=March 4, 2016 }} ''Dallas Life Magazine'' in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', March 1, 1992 (Retrieved January 23, 2008).</ref>

By 1993, the band had evolved into a new direction. Macy left the group for a "purer" [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] sound. Lynch, thrust into the position of sole lead singer, was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer [[Natalie Maines]] after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest.<ref name="Dickerson">Dickerson, James L. (2000) ''Dixie Chicks: Down-Home and Backstage''. Taylor Trade Publishing, Dallas, Texas. {{ISBN|0-87833-189-1}}.</ref> Strayer commented, "We were prepared to pay our dues for as long as it took; we were prepared for longevity. We know that we will always be playing music together, so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

But in later interviews, the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time: the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent.  In an article in the April/May edition of ''Country Music Magazine'', Emily stated, "We felt we needed the next calibre of singer."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[File:Emily-Robison.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Strayer in concert with the [[Dixie Chicks]], Austin, Texas, 2006]]

From there, massive commercial success ensued, with their 1998 and 1999 albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' and  ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' both achieving [[diamond record]] status. Strayer was a key element of the group's look, with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first, and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color, and distinguishing herself visually from the other two. Strayer and Maguire's instrumental virtuosity set the Dixie Chicks apart from many other country acts, male and female. Strayer's songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks' recording career. <!-- needs expansion, reference to particular songs -->

Strayer stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines' remarks about U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] hit the newswire on the eve before the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. She was the only bandmate to realize that - while in the U.K., there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience - back in the United States, Maines' criticism of President Bush would not be well received. Nevertheless, even when her home was trashed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks' successful careers in music, she remained loyal to Maines, as did her sister.

==Court Yard Hounds==
[[File:Emily-Robison 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Strayer with the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]] at Antone's, [[SXSW]], March 18, 2010]]
Strayer spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school, first with her older sister, and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks. After the bandmates celebrated their five [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them, but Strayer was eager to return to writing and touring. When Strayer's marriage came to an end, she began expressing herself by songwriting. Some of her compositions include her feelings about the breakup with her former husband, and expected that soon, the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing, but Natalie Maines was reluctant to do so. After four years, Strayer became "angry and frustrated", and in sending her new songs to her sister, conveyed her increasing disappointment.<ref name="All Things Considered">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126554419|title=Dixie Chicks Musicians Strike Out on Their Own|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=May 6, 2010|work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=October 3, 2010}}</ref> With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily and sister Martie have formed a side project called the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], with Strayer as lead vocalist.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Byrds.

When he graduated from Bonner Springs High School, in [[Bonner Springs, Kansas]], in 1962, he formed a folk group, the Rum Runners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=28}}</ref>

===Formation of the Byrds===
[[File:The Byrds 1965.png|thumb|Clark (second from left) as a member of the Byrds in 1965]]
Clark was invited to join an established regional folk band, the Surf Riders, based in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] at the Castaways Lounge, owned by Hal Harbaum.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=29}}</ref> On August 12, 1963, he was performing with them when he was discovered by the [[The New Christy Minstrels|New Christy Minstrels]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=31}}</ref> They hired him, and he recorded two albums with the ensemble before leaving in early 1964.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=33–39}}</ref> After hearing the [[the Beatles|Beatles]], Clark quit the New Christy Minstrels and moved to Los Angeles, where he met fellow folkie and Beatles convert [[Roger McGuinn|Jim (later Roger) McGuinn]] at the Troubadour Club. In early 1964 they began to assemble a band that would become the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=44}}</ref>

Clark wrote or co-wrote many of the Byrds' best-known originals from their first three albums, including "[[I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better]]", "[[Set You Free This Time]]", "Here Without You", "You Won't Have to Cry", "If You're Gone", "The World Turns All Around Her", "[[She Don't Care About Time]]" and "[[Eight Miles High]]". He initially played rhythm guitar in the band, but relinquished that position to [[David Crosby]] and became the tambourine and harmonica player.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=50–51}}</ref> Bassist [[Chris Hillman]] noted years later in an interview remembering Clark, "At one time, he was the power in the Byrds, not McGuinn, not Crosby—it was Gene who would burst through the stage curtain banging on a tambourine, coming on like a young Prince Valiant. A hero, our savior. Few in the audience could take their eyes off this presence. He ''was'' the songwriter. He had the 'gift' that none of the rest of us had developed yet.... What deep inner part of his soul conjured up songs like 'Set You Free This Time,' 'I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better,' 'I'm Feelin' Higher,' 'Eight Miles High'? So many great songs! We learned a lot of songwriting from him and in the process learned a little bit about ourselves."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=512–513}}</ref>

A management decision gave McGuinn the lead vocals for their major singles and [[Bob Dylan]] songs. This disappointment, combined with Clark's dislike of traveling (including a chronic [[fear of flying]]) and resentment by other band members about the extra income he derived from his songwriting, led to internal squabbling, and he left the group in early 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=88}}</ref> He briefly returned to Kansas City before moving back to Los Angeles to form Gene Clark & the Group with [[Chip Douglas]], [[Joel Larson]], and Bill Rhinehart.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=97–109}}</ref>

===Solo career, brief return to the Byrds and Dillard and Clark===
[[Columbia Records]] (the Byrds' record label) signed Clark as a solo artist, and in 1967 he released his first solo album, ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]''. The Gosdin Brothers were selected to back him because they shared the same manager, Jim Dickson, and because Chris Hillman, who played bass on the album, had worked with the Gosdin Brothers in the mid-1960s when he and they were members of the Southern California bluegrass band the [[The Hillmen|Hillmen]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=113}}</ref> The album was a unique mixture of pop, country rock and baroque psychedelic tracks. It received favorable reviews, but unfortunately for Clark, it was released almost simultaneously with the Byrds' ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', also on Columbia, and (partly because of his 18-month absence from public attention) was a commercial failure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=116–117}}</ref>

With the future of his solo career in doubt, Clark briefly rejoined the Byrds in October 1967 as a replacement for the recently departed David Crosby; following an anxiety attack in Minneapolis, he left after only three weeks.<ref name="einarson">{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=126–127|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> During this brief period with the Byrds, he appeared with the band on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', lip-synching the group's current single, "[[Goin' Back]]"; he also performed "[[Mr. Spaceman]]" with the band.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher|author-link=Christopher Hjort|page=148|year=2008|title=So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> Although there is some disagreement among the band's biographers, Clark is generally viewed as having contributed background vocals to the songs "Goin' Back" and "Space Odyssey" for the forthcoming Byrds' album ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'' and was an uncredited co-author, with McGuinn, of "Get to You", also from that album.<ref name="einarson"/>

In 1968, Clark signed with [[A&M Records]] and began a collaboration with the banjo player [[the Dillards|Doug Dillard]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=130}}</ref> Guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]] (later with [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]), bassist Dave Jackson and mandolinist Don Beck joined them to form the nucleus of Dillard & Clark; in addition, Michael Clarke briefly drummed for the group before joining The Flying Burrito Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=131}}</ref> They produced two albums, ''[[The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]]'' (1968) and ''[[Through the Morning, Through the Night]]'' (1969).

''The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark'' was a pivotal work of acoustic country rock. It included such enduring songs as "Train Leaves Here This Morning" (a collaboration between Clark and Leadon prominently covered by the latter in 1972 on The Eagles' [[Eagles (album)|debut album]]) and "She Darked the Sun" (covered by [[Linda Ronstadt]] on her 1970 album ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]''). In contrast, ''Through the Morning, Through the Night'' was more indebted to [[traditional bluegrass]] but also employed electric instrumentation. By this juncture, Dillard's girlfriend Donna Washburn had joined the group as a backing vocalist, a factor that precipitated the departure of Leadon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=147}}</ref> The shift to traditional bluegrass also caused Clark to lose interest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=149}}</ref> Written by Clark, the title song was used by [[Quincy Jones]] in the soundtrack of the 1972 [[Sam Peckinpah]] film ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]''; it was also covered by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Alison Krauss]] (along with "Polly," another Clark-penned track from the album) on their 2007 album ''[[Raising Sand]]''. Both albums by Dillard & Clark fared poorly on the charts, but they are now regarded as seminal exemplars of the country rock and progressive bluegrass genres.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/65 65]|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/65}}</ref>
The collaboration with Dillard rejuvenated Clark's creativity but greatly contributed to his growing drinking problem.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=134}}</ref> Dillard & Clark disintegrated in late 1969 after the departures of Clark and Leadon. During this period, Clark, Leadon, Jackson and Beck contributed to the debut album of [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], ''[[Rock Salt & Nails (album)|Rock Salt & Nails]],'' released in November 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock|year=2003|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-743-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/eightmileshighfo00sanf/page/191 191]|url=https://archive.org/details/eightmileshighfo00sanf/page/191}}</ref>

In 1970, Clark began work on a new single, recording two tracks with the original members of the Byrds (each recording his part separately). The resulting songs, "She's the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred", were not released at the time, because of legal problems; they were included later on the 1973 album ''[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=161–162}}</ref> In 1970 and 1971, Clark contributed vocals and two compositions ("Tried So Hard" and "Here Tonight") to albums by the Flying Burrito Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=164}}</ref>

Frustrated with the music industry, Clark bought a house in [[Albion, California]] and married former go-go dancer and [[Bell Records]] production assistant Carlie Lynn McCummings in June 1970, with whom he had two sons (Kelly and Kai Clark). In semi-retirement, he subsisted on his still-substantial Byrds royalties throughout the early 1970s, augmented by income from [[The Turtles]]' 1969 American Top Ten hit "[[You Showed Me]]", a previously unreleased composition by McGuinn and Clark from 1964 rearranged for the band by Chip Douglas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-9529540-1-9|page=487}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Bush, John|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-mn0000564239/awards|title=The Turtles &#124; Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref>

===''White Light'' and ''Roadmaster''===
In 1971, Clark released his second solo album, ''[[White Light (Gene Clark album)|White Light]]'' (the title was not on the cover sleeve, and thus some later reviewers mistakenly assumed that the title was ''Gene Clark'').<ref name="Einarson 2005 167">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=167}}</ref> The album was produced by the Native American guitarist [[Jesse Ed Davis]], with whom Clark developed a great rapport, partly due to their common ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=4}}</ref> An intimate, poetic and mostly acoustic work supplemented by Davis's slide guitar, the album contained many introspective tracks, such as "With Tomorrow", "Because of You", "Where My Love Lies Asleep" and "For a Spanish Guitar" (which Bob Dylan reportedly hailed as one of the greatest songs ever written).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/157 157]|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalideasevol00bern_0/page/157}}</ref> All of the material was written by Clark, with the exception of Bob Dylan and [[Richard Manuel]]'s "[[Tears of Rage]]". Launched to considerable critical acclaim, the album failed to gain commercial success, except in the Netherlands, where it was voted album of the year by rock music critics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=168}}</ref> Once more, modest promotion and Clark's refusal to undertake promotional touring adversely affected sales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=486}}</ref>

In the spring of 1971, Clark was commissioned by [[Dennis Hopper]] to contribute the tracks "American Dreamer" and "Outlaw Song" to ''American Dreamer'', a documentary that chronicled the fractious editing process of ''[[The Last Movie]]''.<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/> A rerecorded, longer version of the song "American Dreamer" was later used in the 1977 film ''The Farmer'', along with an instrumental version of the same song plus "Outside the Law (The Outlaw)", a re-recording of "Outlaw Song".<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/>

In 1972, Clark attempted to record a follow-up album. Progress was slow and expensive, and A&M terminated the project before completion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=176}}</ref> The resulting eight tracks, including "Full Circle Song" and "In a Misty Morning", along with those recorded with the Byrds in 1970 and 1971 ("She's the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred") and with the Flying Burrito Brothers ("Here Tonight"), were released in 1973 as ''[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]'' in the Netherlands only.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=487}}</ref>

===''Byrds''===
Clark left A&M in late 1972 to join a reunion of the original five Byrds. They cut the album ''[[Byrds (album)|Byrds]]'', which was released in March 1973 by [[Asylum Records]]. While the album charted relatively well (U.S. No. 20), its placement did not live up to the label's initial expectations in the wake of the recent success of Crosby ([[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]) and Hillman (a member of [[Stephen Stills]]'s band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]]). Clark's compositions "[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]" and "Changing Heart" and the [[Neil Young]] covers on which he sang the lead vocal ("See the Sky About to Rain" and "Cowgirl in the Sand") were widely regarded as the standout tracks on the critically divisive album.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=182}}</ref> Disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with Crosby's performance as the record's producer, the group members chose to dissolve the band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, the Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=354}}</ref> Clark briefly joined McGuinn's solo group, with which he premiered "Silver Raven", arguably his most celebrated post-Byrds song.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182"/>

===''No Other''===
On the basis of the quality of Clark's contributions to ''Byrds'', [[David Geffen]] signed him to Asylum Records in early 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=369}}</ref> The label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singer-songwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadn't experienced since his days with the Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=140}}</ref> While composing the album, he spent long periods with a notebook and an acoustic guitar at the picture window of his home, deriving inspiration from staring at the Pacific Ocean.

Produced by [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]] with a vast array of session musicians (including members of [[The Section (band)|The Section]] and the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]]) and backing singers, the ensuing ''[[No Other]]'' fused elements of country rock, folk, gospel, soul and choral music with poetic, mystical lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=488}}</ref> Although the album was praised by critics, its unconventional arrangements (which anticipated the later innovations of [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Christine McVie]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-other-mw0000202963|title=No Other – Gene Clark – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> limited public appeal.

Clark's return to Los Angeles to record the album resulted in his reversion to a hedonistic lifestyle and accelerated the disintegration of his marriage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=189}}</ref> Disillusioned by professional and marital failure, he mounted his first solo tour by road, playing colleges and clubs with Roger White (lead guitar and backing vocals) and Duke Bardwell (electric bass, backing vocals and acoustic guitar); the drumless trio was billed as Gene Clark and the Silverados.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=194}}</ref>

In 2019, a remastered/remixed version of ''No Other'' was released.

===''Two Sides to Every Story''===
After the commercial failure of ''No Other'', Clark was confused about his artistic direction. Throughout 1975 and 1976, he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of "cosmic" songs fusing country rock with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[funk]], elaborating on the soundscapes of his most recent album. In 1976, he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness. These were submitted to [[RSO Records]], which promptly bought out Clark's Asylum contract and issued the long-gestating ''[[Two Sides to Every Story]]'' in 1977. The album—a melange of bluegrass, traditional [[honky tonk]], echoes of ''No Other'' ("Sister Moon") and strident country rock (a new arrangement of "Kansas City Southern")—was produced by Kaye with an understated touch.<ref name="Rogan 2008 370">{{cite book|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|publisher=Rogan House|year=2008|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|location=London England|page=370}}</ref>

The emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of Clark's compositions, including the aforementioned "Sister Moon", "Lonely Saturday", "Past Addresses", "Silent Crusade" and "Hear the Wind". The album also contains covers of the traditional "In the Pines" (a key component of Clark's live repertoire with the Silverados) and "Give My Love to Marie" by [[James Talley]]. Once again, his style of sensitive balladry failed to achieve success on the U.S. charts. In a belated attempt to find an appreciative public, he reluctantly overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the KC Southern Band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=490–491}}</ref> Some six weeks before his death in 1991, Clark told interviewer [[Bill Wasserzieher]] that he considered ''Two Sides to Every Story'' his best album, rivaled only by ''No Other''.<ref>Wasserzieher, Bill. In Memoriam: The Byrds' Gene Clark (1944–1991). www.rocksbackpages.com, September 1991.</ref>

===''McGuinn, Clark & Hillman''===
For his British tour dates, Clark found himself on the same bill as ex-Byrds [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Chris Hillman]], each fronting their own bands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=372}}</ref> Shortly after returning to the United States, Clark and McGuinn began touring as an acoustic duo. After Hillman joined his former bandmates, the reformed trio named themselves [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]] and signed with [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=382}}</ref> Produced by [[the Albert Brothers]] (who had recently recorded Crosby, Stills & Nash's [[CSN (album)|1977 comeback album]]), the ensuing ''McGuinn, Clark & Hillman'' (1979) was a rebirth in both performing and songwriting for Clark, who ensconced himself as the group's dominant creative force. He wrote four songs for the album, including "Backstage Pass" (a rumination on the ennui of touring and his fear of flying), "Release Me Girl" (a [[disco]]-inflected collaboration with [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]]), the [[UFO]]-inspired "Feelin' Higher" and "Little Mama".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|pages=385–387}}</ref>

Many critics felt that the album's slick production and [[disco]]-influenced [[soft rock]] rhythms didn't flatter the group, but the album reached No. 39 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (underpinned by the McGuinn-penned "Don't You Write Her Off", which peaked at No. 33 in May 1979) and earned a [[RIAA]] gold certification, selling well enough to generate a follow-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310280/mcguinn-clark-hillman/chart|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman – Chart history|publisher=Billboard|date=May 12, 1979|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref> McGuinn, Clark and Hillman's second release was to have been a full group effort entitled ''City''; although it was ultimately released in 1980, a combination of Clark's unreliability (including experimentation with heroin) and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction (mostly regarding Ron and Howard Albert's production) resulted in the album being credited to "Roger McGuinn & Chris Hillman featuring Gene Clark." Despite the turmoil, Clark penned the song "Won't Let You Down". By 1981, Clark had left, and the group recorded one more album as "McGuinn/Hillman".<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=227–231}}</ref>

===Rehabilitation, ''Firebyrd'' and ''So Rebellious a Lover''===
Clark moved to Hawaii with Jesse Ed Davis to try to overcome his drug dependency, remaining there until the end of 1981.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=978-0-95295-401-9|page=492}}</ref> Upon his return to Los Angeles, he assembled a new band, the Firebyrds, and in 1982 proceeded to record what would eventually become the album ''Firebyrd''. While waiting for the album to be released, Clark joined up with Chris Hillman and others in an abortive venture called Flyte, which failed to secure a recording contract and was quickly dissolved.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=239–242}}</ref> The eventual release of ''Firebyrd'' in 1984 coincided with the emergence of jangle rockers like [[R.E.M.]] and [[Tom Petty]], who had sparked a new interest in the Byrds. Clark also began developing new fans among LA's roots-conscious [[Paisley Underground]] scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=250–251}}</ref> Later in the decade, he embraced his new status by appearing as a guest with the [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]], in a session arranged by Saul Davis and he cut an acclaimed duo album with [[Carla Olson]] of the Textones titled ''[[So Rebellious a Lover]]'' (including the notable "[[Gypsy Rider]]" and "Del Gato") in 1986. The album included contributions from Chris Hillman, Stephen McCarthy (of The Long Ryders) and Randy Fuller (of the [[Bobby Fuller Four]]) and was produced and arranged by session drummer [[Michael Huey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-huey-p88388/credits|title=Michael Huey – Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Later career, illness and death===
In 1985, Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman regarding a reformation of the Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]".<ref name="byrdwatcher12">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Byrds v. Byrds: The 20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds 1984–1988|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spname1.html|access-date=May 25, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429120942/http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spname1.html|archive-date=April 29, 2010}}</ref> The three of them showed no interest. Clark decided to assemble a "[[superstar]]" collection of musicians, including ex-[[Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Firefall]] member [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], ex-[[Beach Boys]] singer and guitarist [[Blondie Chaplin]], ex-[[The Band|Band]] members [[Rick Danko]] and [[Richard Manuel]], and ex-Byrds [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] and [[John York (musician)|John York]]. Clark initially called his band "The 20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds" and began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|page=255|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> A number of [[Tour promoter|concert promoters]] began to shorten the band's name to "the Byrds" in advertisements and promotional material.<ref name="byrdwatcher12"/> As the band continued to tour throughout 1985, their agent decided to shorten the name to "the Byrds" permanently, to the displeasure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman. Clark eventually discontinued performing with his own "Byrds" band, but drummer Clarke continued on with Skip Battin (occasionally with ex-Byrds York and Gene Parsons), forming another "Byrds" group, prompting McGuinn, Hillman, and Crosby to go on the road as "the Byrds" in an attempt to establish a claim to the rights to the name. Their effort failed this time; Clark was not included in the reunion, primarily because of his involvement with the act that didn't include them. Crosby finally secured rights to the name in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Terry Jones|title=Younger Than Yesterday: Biography|publisher=terryjonesrogers.com|url=http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|access-date=April 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212021/http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Varga|first=George|title=CD Proves to Everything There Is a Season| date = September 24, 2006 | work =[[The San Diego Union-Tribune|San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html|access-date=April 25, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018221327/http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html | archive-date = October 18, 2012 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

Despite the critical success of ''So Rebellious a Lover'', which led to several TV appearances (including ''[[Nashville Now]]''), Clark was increasingly afflicted with serious health problems, including [[ulcers]] and [[alcohol dependence]]. In 1988, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant ulcer.

A period of abstinence and recovery followed until [[Tom Petty]] covered "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better" on ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'' (1989), yielding a windfall of royalties from the album (which peaked at No. 3 in the United States) to Clark. Flush with money, he began to neglect his professional obligations. Although the circumstances remain nebulous (with Carla Olson citing alleged financial improprieties), the binge also precipitated his final break-up with Terri Messina, who had had a two-decade [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Clark.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=286}}</ref>

During this period, The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1991, at which the original lineup performed several songs together, including Clark's "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Byrds Setlist at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony #6|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-byrds/1991/waldorf-astoria-hotel-new-york-ny-4bc56ba2.html|website=setlist.fm|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>

Clark's health continued to decline as his substance abuse accelerated, and he was diagnosed with throat cancer in early 1991. He died on May 24, 1991, at the age of 46 from [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] as a result of a bleeding ulcer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Archives |first=L. A.

===Covers and tribute songs===
During his career and after his death, Clark's songs have been covered by a number of artists. [[Iain Matthews]] was an early promoter of Clark's songs, covering "Polly" on his 1972 album ''[[Journeys from Gospel Oak]]''  and "Tried So Hard" on his 1974 album ''[[Some Days You Eat the Bear]]''. "Tried So Hard" was later covered by [[Yo la Tengo]] on ''[[Fakebook (album)|Fakebook]]'' in 1990. [[Death in Vegas]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] covered his song "So You Say You Lost Your Baby" on their 2003 album ''[[Scorpio Rising (Death in Vegas album)|Scorpio Rising]]''. In 1993 the Scottish band [[Teenage Fanclub]] recorded a tribute entitled "Gene Clark" on their album ''[[Thirteen (Teenage Fanclub album)|Thirteen]]''.

In 2007, two of his songs were recorded by [[Alison Krauss]] and [[Robert Plant]] on the [[T-Bone Burnett]]–produced ''[[Raising Sand]]'':  "Polly Come Home" and "Through the Morning, Through the Night." Also in 2007, [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris]] and [[Rich Robinson]] released a live version of "Polly" on their album ''[[Brothers of a Feather: Live at the Roxy]]''. [[This Mortal Coil]] covered "Strength of Strings" from his album ''No Other'' and "With Tomorrow" from his album ''White Light''. [[Soulsavers]] with [[Mark Lanegan]] recorded a version of "Some Misunderstanding" from ''No Other'' on their 2009 release, ''[[Broken (Soulsavers album)|Broken]]''. The song "Gorgeous" from [[Kanye West]]'s 2010 album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' is based on elements of The Turtles' cover of "You Showed Me".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy|title-link=My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy|others=[[Kanye West]]|year=2010|page=11|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Roc-A-Fella Records]]}}</ref>

==Documentary==
A documentary about Clark's life and career, entitled ''The Byrd Who Flew Alone'', was released in 2013, featuring contributions from family, friends, the three surviving original members of the [[The Byrds|Byrds]], latter-day Byrd John York and late-era collaborators Carla Olson and Pat Robinson. The documentary revealed that Clark was suffering from throat cancer at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foursunsproductions.com/Gene-Clark-Documentary/|title="The Byrd Who Flew Alone: The Triumphs And Tragedy Of Gene Clark" Documentary|publisher=www.foursunsproductions.com|access-date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>

'''Gillian Howard Welch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|l|i|ən|_|ˈ|w|ɛ|l|tʃ}}; born October 2, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter. She performs with her musical partner, guitarist [[David Rawlings]]. Their sparse and dark musical style, which combines elements of [[Appalachian music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]], is described by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as "at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms."<ref name="new_yorker" />

Welch and Rawlings have collaborated on nine critically acclaimed albums, five released under her name, three released under Rawlings' name, and two under both of their names. Her 1996 debut, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', and the 2001 release ''[[Time (The Revelator)]]'', received nominations for the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Her 2003 album, ''[[Soul Journey]]'', introduced electric guitar, drums, and a more upbeat sound to their body of work. After a gap of eight years, she released a fifth studio album, ''[[The Harrow & the Harvest]]'', in 2011, which was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. In 2020, Welch and Rawlings released ''[[All the Good Times (Are Past & Gone)]]'', which won the 2021 [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Hussey|first=Allison|date=March 14, 2021|title=Gillian Welch and David Rawlings Win Best Folk Album at 2021 Grammys|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/gillian-welch-and-david-rawlings-win-best-folk-album-at-2021-grammys/|access-date=December 28, 2021|website=Pitchfork|language=en-US}}</ref>

Welch was an associate producer and performed on two songs of the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the [[Coen brothers]] 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', a [[platinum album]] that won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 2002. She also appeared in the film attempting to buy a Soggy Bottom Boys record. Welch, while not one of the principal actors, did sing and provide additional lyrics to the Sirens song "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby." In 2018 she and Rawlings wrote the song "When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings" for the Coens' ''[[The Ballad of Buster Scruggs]]'', for which they received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].

==Early life==
Welch was born on October 2, 1967, in New York City, and was adopted by Mitzie Welch (née Marilyn Cottle)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4444010-Marilyn-Welch|title = Marilyn Welch| website=[[Discogs]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=marilyn-welch-mitzie&pid=171578104|title = Marilyn Welch Obituary (2014) - Los Angeles, CA - Los Angeles Times| website=[[Legacy.com]] }}</ref> and Ken Welch, comedy and music entertainers.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Her biological mother was a [[freshman]] in college, and her father was a musician visiting New York City.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="guardian_2003"/><ref name="paste_2003"/> Welch has speculated that her biological father could have been one of her favorite musicians, and she later discovered from her adoptive parents that he was a drummer.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="guardian_2003"/><ref name="paste_2003"/> [[Alec Wilkinson]] of ''The New Yorker'' stated that "from an address they had been given, it appeared that her mother ... may have grown up in the [[Western North Carolina|mountains of North Carolina]]".<ref name="new_yorker" /> When Welch was three, her adoptive parents moved to Los Angeles to write music for ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]''. They also appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.<ref name="new_yorker" />
{{Listen|filename=GillianWelchOrphanGirl.ogg|title="Orphan Girl"|description=The first track on Gillian Welch's first album ''Revival''. This song exemplifies Welch and Rawlings' minimal arrangements and Welch's lyrics about outcasts}}
As a child, Welch was introduced to the music of American [[folk singers]] [[Bob Dylan]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and the [[Carter Family]]. She performed folk songs with her peers at the [[The Westland School (Los Angeles)|Westland Elementary School]] in Los Angeles.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="la_times_2004"/> Welch later attended [[Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California)|Crossroads School]], a high school in [[Santa Monica, California]]. While in high school, a local television program featured her as a student who "excelled at everything she did."<ref name="new_yorker" />

While a student at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], Welch played bass in a [[goth music|goth]] band, and drums in a [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[surf rock|surf]] band.<ref name="new_yorker" /> In college, a roommate played an album by the bluegrass band [[The Stanley Brothers]], and she had an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]:

<blockquote>The first song came on and I just stood up and I kind of walked into the other room as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as powerful as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.<ref name="sf_chronicle_2005" /></blockquote>

After graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in photography, Welch attended the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], where she majored in songwriting.<ref name="nodep_book" /> During her two years studying at Berklee, Welch gained confidence as a performer.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="nodep_book" /> Welch met her music partner [[David Rawlings]] at a successful audition for Berklee's only country band.<ref name="boston_globe_2003" /><ref name="theage_bevhillybilly" />

==Career==
[[File:Gillian Smile.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man with his head down playing a guitar with a smiling Welch also playing guitar on stage. Both play in front of microphones.|Rawlings and Welch performing in Seattle in 2009]]
Upon finishing college in 1992, Welch moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="times_london_2003" /> She recalled, "I looked at my record collection and saw that all the music I loved had been made in Nashville—[[Bill Monroe]], Dylan, [[the Stanley Brothers]], [[Neil Young]]—so I moved there. Not ever thinking I was thirty years too late."<ref name="new_yorker" /> Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing "[[Long Black Veil (song)|Long Black Veil]]," the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo.<ref name="new_yorker" /> They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as "Gillian Welch."<ref name="new_yorker" /> A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a [[Talent manager|manager]], [[Denise Stiff]], who already managed [[Alison Krauss]]. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band.<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="la_times_2004" /> They eventually signed a recording contract with [[Almo Sounds]].<ref name="la_times_2004" /> Following a performance opening for [[Peter Rowan]] at the [[Station Inn]], producer [[T-Bone Burnett]] expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch's and Rawlings' preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.<ref name="no_dep_1996" />

===''Revival''===
For the recording sessions of Welch's debut, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', Burnett wanted to recapture the bare sound of Welch's live performance.<ref name="no_dep_1996" /> Welch recalled, "That first week was really intense. It was just T-Bone, the engineer, and Dave and myself. We got so inside our little world. There was very little distance between our singing and playing. The sound was very immediate. It was so light and small."<ref name="no_dep_1996" /> Later, they recorded several more songs and played with an expanded group of musicians:  guitarist and [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee [[James Burton]], bassist [[Roy Huskey, Jr.]], and veteran session drummers [[Jim Keltner]] and [[Buddy Harman]].<ref name="no_dep_1996" />

The album was released in April 1996 to mostly positive reviews. Mark Deming of [[Allmusic]] called it a "superb debut" and wrote, "Welch's debts to artists of the past are obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there's a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn't expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family."<ref name="amg_revival" /> Bill Friskics-Warren of ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' praised the album as "breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture."<ref name="no_dep_1996" /> The Arlington Heights, Illinois ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]''{{'}}s Mark Guarino observed that ''Revival'' was "cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era." He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett's threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch's vocals.<ref name="cdh_2003" /> [[Ann Powers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''Revival'' a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and "manufacturing emotion."<ref name="rollingstone_revival" /> [[Robert Christgau]] echoed Powers: Welch "just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off."<ref name="robchrist_revival" />

The song, "Orphan Girl," from ''Revival'' has been covered by Emmylou Harris, Ann Wilson, Karin Bergquist of Over the Rhine, Mindy Smith, Patty Griffin, Linda Ronstadt, Tim & Mollie O'Brien and Holly Williams.

Others who have recorded Welch's songs include Joan Baez, Grace Porter, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile, Punch Brothers, Mike Gordon, Bright Eyes, Calexico, Ani DiFranco, The Decemberists, [[Karl Blau]], Jim James, and JD Pinkus.

''Revival'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Awards of 1997|1997]] [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], but lost to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]].''<ref name="nodep_1998" />

===''Hell Among the Yearlings''===
The duo's 1998 ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' continued the rustic and dark themes; the songs' subject matter varies from a female character killing a rapist, a mining accident, a [[murder ballad]], and an ode to [[morphine]] before death.<ref name="rs_hell" /> Like ''Revival'', ''Hell Among The Yearlings'' featured a sparse style that focused on Rawlings and Welch's voices and guitars.<ref name="rs_hell" /><ref name="wsj_1998" />

[[File:Gillian Welch 2007.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Welch singing and playing guitar on stage, wearing a black dress.|Welch performing at the 2007 New Orleans [[Jazz&nbsp;Fest]]]] 
The album also received favorable reviews. [[Robert Wilonsky]] of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' observed that Welch "inhabits a role so completely, the fiction separating character and audience disappears".<ref name="dallas_hell" /> Thom Owens (Allmusic) stated that the album "lacks some of the focus" of ''Revival'', but is "a thoroughly satisfying second album" and proof that her debut was not a fluke.<ref name="amg_hell" /> ''No Depression'''s Farnum Brown commended the live and "immediate feel" of the album, Welch's [[clawhammer banjo]],<ref name="livedaily_2004" /> and Rawlings' harmonies.<ref name="nodep_1998" /> Similar to ''Revival'', Welch was praised for reflecting influences such as the Stanley Brothers, but still managing to create an original sound,<ref name="wsj_1998" /> while Chris Herrington from [[Minneapolis]]'s ''[[City Pages]]'' criticized the songs' lack of authenticity. He wrote "Welch doesn't write folk songs; she writes folk songs about writing folk songs."<ref name="minn_city_pages" />

Welch sang two songs and served as the associate producer for the Burnett-produced [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 2000 film of the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou?|same name]].<ref name="nodep_2001" /> She shared vocals with Alison Krauss on a rendition of the gospel song "[[I'll Fly Away]]." Dave McKenna of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised their version: the singers "soar together."<ref name="washpost_dec_24_2000" /> Burnett and Welch wrote additional lyrics for the song "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby," sung by Welch, Emmylou Harris, and Krauss. The song is an elaboration of an [[Music of Mississippi|old Mississippi tune]] discovered by [[Alan Lomax]], and was nominated for the [[2002 Grammy Awards|2002]] [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].<ref name="cmt_1_2002" /> The [[platinum album]] won the 2002 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].

===''Time (The Revelator)''===
When [[Universal Music Group]] purchased Almo Sounds, Welch began her own independent label, Acony Records (named for the Appalachian wildflower, [[Shortia galacifolia|Acony Bell]], subject of the song of that name on ''Revival'').<ref name="la_times_2004" /><ref name="cdh_2003" /> Rawlings produced the first release on Welch's new label, the 2001 album ''[[Time (The Revelator)]].''<ref name="cdh_2003" /><ref name="ottawa_time" /> All but one song on the album was recorded in the historic [[RCA Studio B]] in Nashville.<ref name="billboard_time" /> "I Want To Sing That Rock and Roll" was recorded live at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in the recording sessions for the concert film ''[[Down from the Mountain]]''.

Welch has said the album is about [[American history]], [[rock 'n' roll]], and [[country music]].<ref name="theage_2004" /> There are songs about the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], the [[Titanic Disaster]], [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]], and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="billboard_time" />  ''Time'' continues Welch and Rawlings' style of mellow and sparse arrangements. Welch explained, "As opposed to being little tiny folk songs or traditional songs, they're really tiny rock songs. They're just performed in this acoustic setting. In our heads we went electric without changing instruments."<ref name="amg_time" />

''Time (The Revelator)'' received extensive critical praise, most of which focused on the evolution of lyrics from mountain ballads.<ref name="nodep_2001" /><ref name="amg_time" /><ref name="charleston_gazette" /> For Michael Shannon Friedman of ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'', "Welch's soul-piercing, backwoods quaver has always been a treasure, but on this record her songwriting is absolutely stunning."<ref name="charleston_gazette" /> Critics compare the last track, the 15-minute "I Dream a Highway", to classics by Bob Dylan and [[Neil Young]]. Zac Johnson of Allmusic described ''I Dream ...'' as akin to "sweetly dozing in the [river] current like [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and Jim's [[Mississippi River]] afternoons".<ref name="amg_time" /><ref name="charleston_gazette" /> ''No Depression''{{'}}s Grant Alden wrote, "Welch and Rawlings have gathered ... fragments from across the rich history of American music and reset them as small, subtle jewels adorning their own keenly observed, carefully constructed language."<ref name="nodep_2001" /> ''Time'' finished thirteenth in the 2001 ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] music critic poll.<ref name="pazzjop2001" /> ''Time (The Revelator)'' appeared in best of decade lists of ''Rolling Stone'', ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', ''[[The Irish Times]]'', and the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''.<ref name="ottawa_time" /><ref name="paste_bestofdecade" /><ref name=RS2000 /><ref name="uncut_best_of" /><ref name="irish_times_decade" /> The album was nominated for the [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002]] [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], but lost to Bob Dylan's ''[["Love and Theft"|Love and Theft]]''.<ref name="seattle_times_grammys" /> ''Time'' peaked at No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Independent Album [[Billboard charts|chart]].<ref name="billboard_time_chart" />

''[[The Revelator Collection]]'' DVD was released in 2002. It featured live performances and [[music videos]] of songs from ''Time'', and some [[Cover version|covers]]. The concert footage was filmed in 2001, and the music videos included Welch and Rawlings performing three songs at RCA Studio B. ''No Depression''{{'}}s Barry Mazor praised the DVD as an accompaniment for ''Time'', calling it "one last exclamation point on that memorable and important project."<ref name="nodep_DVD" />

===''Soul Journey''===
{{Listen|filename=GillianWelchWreckingBall.ogg|title="Wrecking Ball"|description=The final track on Gillian Welch's fourth album ''Soul Journey''. The electric guitar and drums represent a new sound for Welch and David Rawlings}}
For the 2003 release, ''[[Soul Journey]]'', Welch and Rawlings explored new territory. Welch said: "I wanted to make it a happier record. Out of our four records, I thought this might be the one where you're driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day."<ref name="greensboro_nr_2003" /> Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a [[dobro]], violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, "Everything's not supposed to sound the same, you want it to reflect change and growth."<ref name="boston_globe_2003" />

In three songs of ''Soul Journey,'' for the first time Welch and Rawlings recorded their own versions of traditional folk songs.<ref name="nodep_2003" />

''Soul Journey'' also garnered significant acclaim.

=== David Rawlings Projects ===
In addition to their work released under the name “Gillian Welch,” Welch and Rawlings have continued to build upon their partnership with several releases under Rawlings’ name. The Rawlings releases generally feature a larger string band and more lush arrangements than their “Gillian Welch” material, and have usually been released under the band name [[Dave Rawlings Machine]]. Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' described the band’s 2009 debut album ''A Friend of a Friend'' as "akin to one of Welch's albums, but with the balance of their harmonies swapped to favour Rawlings' voice".<ref name="guardian_rawlings" /> Welch co-wrote five of the songs with Rawlings, and provided guitar and harmony vocals.<ref name="tenn_blog" /><ref name="popmatters_rawlings" />  Although ostensibly Rawlings' first solo album, Alex Ramon of ''[[PopMatters]]'' noted the similarities to Welch albums.<ref name="popmatters_rawlings" /> ''Paste Magazine''{{'}}s [[Stephen Deusner]] praised ''A Friend of a Friend'' for incorporating "a wide swath of traditional American music," comments echoed by ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Will Hermes and in the ''PopMatters'' piece.<ref name="popmatters_rawlings" /><ref name="paste_rawlings_review" /><ref name="rolling_stone_rawlings" />

On September 18, 2015, the duo released their second album under the band title Dave Rawlings Machine, ''Nashville Obsolete''. The band includes [[Willie Watson (musician)|Willie Watson]], [[Paul Kowert]], [[Brittany Haas]], and occasionally includes [[Jordan Tice]].

Released on August 11, 2017, ''Poor David’s Almanack'' was the first Welch/Rawlings collaboration to be released under the name David Rawlings, dropping the previous Dave Rawlings Machine moniker. The song “Cumberland Gap,” which features on the album, was nominated for the 2018 [[Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song]]. It was also utilized in the opening sequence of the 2019 Guy Richie film, ''[[The Gentlemen (2019 film)|The Gentlemen]].''<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 6, 2017 |title=David Rawlings: Poor David's Almanack review – his most Welch-like release by far |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/06/david-rawlings-poor-davids-almanack-review-gillian-welch-guitar-man |access-date=July 19, 2022 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

===''The Harrow & the Harvest''===
In a 2007 feature in ''[[The Guardian]]'', critic John Harris expressed frustration that there had not been a Gillian Welch release in four years.<ref name="guardian_2007" /> [[Creation Records]] founder [[Alan McGee]] showed optimism about Welch and Rawlings testing out some new songs while opening some concerts for [[Rilo Kiley]], and wrote in a 2009 blog entry "the long gestation period signals nothing less than a perfect album".<ref name="guardian_sept_2009" /> In 2009, Rawlings said that recording for the next Gillian Welch album has started, but did not give a release date.<ref name="paste_rawlings" />

''[[The Harrow & the Harvest]]'' was released on June 28, 2011.<ref name=asw/> Welch attributed the long time period between releases to dissatisfaction with the songs they were writing.<ref name="harvesttime">{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/harvest-time-after-long-journey-for-gillian-welch/story-e6frg8n6-1226075001358|title=Harvest time after long journey for Gillian Welch|last=Shedden |first=Iain|date=June 18, 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=June 18, 2011}}</ref> She explained: "Our songcraft slipped and I really don't know why.

==Musical style==
Welch and Rawlings incorporate elements of early twentieth century music such as [[old-time music|old time]], [[classic country]], [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[traditional bluegrass]] with modern elements of [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock 'n' roll]], [[jazz]], and [[punk rock]].<ref name="new_yorker" /> ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[Alec Wilkinson]] maintained their musical style is "not easily classified—it is at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms".<ref name="new_yorker" />

The instrumentation on their songs is usually a simple arrangement, with Welch and Rawlings accompanying their own vocals with acoustic guitars, banjos, or a mandolin.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Welch plays rhythm guitar with a 1956 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] J-50 (or banjo), while Rawlings plays lead on a 1935 [[Epiphone]] Olympic Guitar.<ref name="acoustic_guitar_what_they_play" /> ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s Wilkinson described Rawlings as a "strikingly inventive guitarist" who plays solos that are "daring melodic leaps".<ref name="new_yorker" /> A review in ''No Depression'' by Andy Moore observed that Rawlings "squeezes, strokes, chokes and does just about everything but blow into" his guitar.<ref name="nodep_2009_rawlings" />

{{clear}}

===Themes===
Many songs performed by Welch and Rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty, drug addiction, death, a disconnection from their family, and an unresponsive God.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Despite Welch being the lead singer, several of these characters are male.<ref name="new_yorker" /> Welch has commented, "To be commercial, everybody wants happy love songs. People would flat-out ask me, 'Don't you have any happy love songs?' Well, as a matter of fact, I don't. I've got songs about orphans and morphine addicts."<ref name="times_london_2003" /> To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs. Their tempo is compared to a "slow heartbeat", and Cowperthwait of ''Rolling Stone'' observed that their songs "can lull you into near-hypnosis and then make your jaw drop with one final revelation".<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="rs_1998" />

===Reception===
[[File:Gillian welch.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.66|alt=Welch in a green tanktop sings into a microphone while playing guitar.|Welch performing at the 2009 [[Newport&nbsp;Folk&nbsp;Festival]]]]
[[Geoffrey Himes]] of ''The Washington Post'' described Welch as "one of the most interesting singer-songwriters of her generation".<ref name="wash_post_2001" /> In 2003, Tom Kielty of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' observed that she was "quietly establishing one of the most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music", and a 2007 piece in ''The Guardian'' by John Harris called Welch "one of the decade's greatest talents".<ref name="guardian_2007" /><ref name="boston_2003" /> Critic [[Robert Hilburn]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "At every turn, she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heart."<ref name="latimes_1996" />

When Welch's first two albums came out, critics questioned the authenticity of her music, as she was raised in [[Southern California]], but performed [[Appalachia]]n themed songs.<ref name="theage_bevhillybilly" /><ref name="wsj_1998" /><ref name="boston_globe_1998" /> For ''Revival'', Welch was criticized for "manufacturing emotion", and a review of ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' by Chris Herrington of ''City Pages'' stated, "Welch is someone who discovered old-time music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about", and that she is "completely devoid of individuality".<ref name="rollingstone_revival" /><ref name="minn_city_pages" /> Other critics rejected the notion that her background affects the authenticity of her music. Music critic [[Mark Kemp]] defended Welch in a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece:

<blockquote>The first-person protagonist of Ms. Welch's song ("Caleb Meyer") may be a young girl from a time and place that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, but the feelings the singer expresses about rape, and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre, are nothing if not poignantly authentic. Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of "the black dust towns of [[East Tennessee]]" about which she sings in "Miner's Refrain" because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear.<ref name="nyt_1998" /> </blockquote>

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'''s Taylor Holliday echoed this: "Stingy critics give Ms. Welch a hard time because she's a California city girl, not an Appalachian coal miner's daughter. But as [[Lucinda Williams|Lucinda]] or Emmylou might attest, love of the music is not a birthright, but an earned right. Listen to Ms. Welch yodel, in a tune about that no-good "gal" Morphine, and you know she's as mountain as they come."<ref name="wsj_1998" />

On September 16, 2015, the duo was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting by the Americana Music Association.

Welch emphasizes music from a previous era as her major influence. She said that "by and large I listen to people who are dead. I'm really of the tried-and-true school. I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant."<ref name="boston_globe_1998" /> Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the [[Carter Family]], the [[Louvin Brothers]], and the [[Blue Sky Boys]].<ref name="new_yorker" /><ref name="nyt_feb_2004" /> She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the [[Bill Monroe|Monroe Brothers]], the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear I was never going to be able to do exactly that; I'm a songwriter."<ref name="newzealand_2004" />

In 1931, Jones joined the Pine Ridge String Band, which provided the musical accompaniment for the ''[[Lum and Abner]]'' show. By 1935 his pursuit of a musical career took him to [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] radio in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he met musician/songwriter [[Bradley Kincaid]], who gave him the nickname "Grandpa Jones" when he was 22 years old, because of his off-stage grumpiness at early-morning radio shows. Jones liked the name and decided to create a stage persona based around it. Later in life, he lived in [[Mountain View, Arkansas]]. In the 1940s he met rising country radio star [[Cousin Emmy]], from whom he learned to play the [[banjo]].

Performing as Grandpa Jones, he played the guitar or [[banjo]], [[yodeling|yodeled]], and sang mostly old-time [[ballad]]s. By 1937, Jones had made his way to West Virginia, where [[Cousin Emmy]] taught Jones the art of the [[clawhammer]] style of [[banjo]] playing, which gave a rough backwoods flavor to his performances.<ref name="Wadey">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-grandpa-jones-1147179.html|title=Obituary: Grandpa Jones|last1=Wadey|first1=Paul|date=27 February 1998|access-date=9 January 2018|publisher=Independent}}</ref>  First experience playing music in public came at the age of 11 or thereabouts The music of the WLS Barn Dance in Chicago was a major influence on Louis, as were the [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] records his sister brought home. <!--He won a contest which is featured as singer and host in 1929, "I won fifty dollars in ten dollar gold pieces, and of course I went right out and brought a better guitar!"

This bit is evidently mangled and makes little sense. Comment back in once it has been clarified.--> In 1942, Jones joined [[WLW]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. It was there that he met fellow Kentuckian [[Merle Travis]]. In 1943, they made their recording debuts together for [[Syd Nathan]]'s upstart [[King Records (United States)|King Records]].<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> Jones was making records under his own name for King by 1944 and had his first hit with "It's Raining Here This Morning."

His recording career was put on hold when he enlisted in the United States Army during [[World War II]]. Discharged in 1946, he recorded again for King. Through 1946–1949, when he and several Opry cast members ([[Clyde Moody]] and [[Chubby Wise]] among them) were invited to become a part of the burgeoning world of television by Washington D.C. entrepreneur Connie B Gay, he became a cast member at the Old Dominion Barn Dance, broadcast over WRVA in Richmond, Virginia.<ref name="Bluegrass"/> In March 1946, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and started performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He married Ramona Riggins on October 14, 1946. As an accomplished performer herself, she would take part in his performances. Jones' vaudeville humor was a bridge to television. His more famous songs include "T For Texas," "Are You From Dixie," "Night Train To Memphis," "[[Good Old Mountain Dew|Mountain Dew]]," and "Eight More Miles To Louisville."

In the fall of 1968,<ref name="Bluegrass"/> Jones became a charter cast member on the long-running television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'', often responding to the show's skits with his trademark phrase "Outrageous." He also played banjo, by himself or with banjo player [[David "Stringbean" Akeman]]. A musical segment featured in the early years had Jones and "his lovely wife Ramona" singing while ringing bells held in their hands and strapped to their ankles. A favorite skit had off-camera cast members ask, "Hey Grandpa, what's for supper?" in which he would describe a delicious, country-style meal, often in a rhyming, [[talking blues]] style. Sometimes he would describe something not so good; i.e. "Because you were bad, thawed out [[TV dinner]]s!"

==Testimony==
A resident of rural [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside Nashville, he was a neighbor and friend of fellow musician [[David "Stringbean" Akeman]]. On the morning of November 11, 1973, Jones discovered the bodies of Akeman and his wife, Estelle, who had been murdered during the night by robbers.<ref>Cooper, Peter (15 October 2014). "1973 killings brought fear to Nashville". The Tennessean. Retrieved 10 January 2018.</ref> Jones testified at the trial of the killers; his testimony helped to secure a conviction.<ref>''Brown v. State'', unpublished decision at 1991 WL 242928.</ref>

==Honors==
In 1978, Jones was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. His autobiography ''Everybody's Grandpa: Fifty Years Behind the Mike'' was published in 1984.<ref name=":3">Jones, Louis M. with Charles K. Wolfe. (1984).

He played a variety of music, including bluegrass, Grateful Dead, and folk in a duo with best friend Nathan Lajoie as a teenager.<ref name=DO-1999 />

During his childhood in Due West, many music acts came to [[Erskine College]]. Lauderdale remembers enjoying the album ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle be Unbroken]]'' by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] and [[Neil Young]]'s ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]].''<ref name=HometownHeart-1999>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Peter|title=Hometown Heart: Due West native Jim Lauderdale comes to Greenville for an important performance |url=http://web.cln.com/archives/greenville/newsstand/archives/051097/vibes2.htm |work=Greenville / Spartanburg Arts & Entertainment|publisher=Creative Loafing Online|access-date=December 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991009193946/http://web.cln.com/archives/greenville/newsstand/archives/051097/vibes2.htm|archive-date=October 9, 1999}}</ref> He attended the [[Carolina Friends School]] in Durham NC and then went on to the [[North Carolina School of the Arts]] in [[Winston-Salem, NC]], studying theater.

== Career ==
[[File:Lauderdale-fls.jpg|thumb|left|Jim Lauderdale at MerleFest in 2007.]]

After graduating from college, Lauderdale lived in Nashville for five months in the summer of 1979 while he tried to get a recording or publishing deal. He hung out a lot with [[Roland White]], an accomplished mandolin player, with whom he cut a record. But things never took off, so he decided to move to New York,<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013>{{cite web|last=Dye|first=David|title=Buddy Miller And Jim Lauderdale On World Cafe |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/11/176161225/buddy-miller-and-jim-lauderdale-on-world-cafe|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=January 3, 2014|format=audio interview|date=April 11, 2013}}</ref> where he played in [[Floyd Domino]]'s band and performed as a solo artist. In 1980 he met singer-songwriter [[Buddy Miller]].<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 /> He played in Miller's band in the active twang music scene that was evolving at the time.<ref name=DO-1999 />

During his time in New York City, he also worked in the mailroom and as a messenger at ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref name=NPR-Buddy&JimTDC /> He often was assigned to pick up and drop off photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]]'s equipment.<ref name=DO-1999 />

Lauderdale joined the national touring production of ''[[Pump Boys & Dinettes]]'', which eventually reached Los Angeles where he met musicians [[Rosie Flores]], Billy Bremmer, [[Pete Anderson]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], and others.<ref name=DO-1999 /> John Ciambotti became Lauderdale's manager and Lauderdale relocated to Los Angeles in the late 1980s, recording an album for CBS (which was later released as ''The Point of No Return''). The record was influenced by the [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] sound of [[Buck Owens]].<ref name=DO-1999 />

Armed with a catalog of a few hundred songs he had written, Lauderdale was able to get a publishing deal with a small company called Blue Water Music (based in Houston, with a small office in Nashville). Living in Los Angeles he made a record with Anderson producing, but it was never released.<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 />

Lauderdale then got a publishing deal with Reprise and moved into the second floor of Buddy and Julie Miller's house until he got his own place in Nashville.<ref name=NPR-WorldCafe-2013 />

In 2013, Lauderdale started his own record label, Sky Crunch, so that he could release his many albums on a schedule that suited him.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode275 Americana Music Show #275], published December 1, 2015</ref>

In April 2018, Lauderdale signed to Yep Roc Records.<ref name=Yep-Roc-Records>{{cite web|title=Yep Roc Records Welcomes Jim Lauderdale!|url=http://www.yeproc.com/yep-roc-records-welcomes-jim-lauderdale|access-date=May 23, 2018|date=April 24, 2018}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===

Lauderdale's solo debut, ''Planet of Love'', was produced by [[Rodney Crowell]] and [[John Leventhal]] and released in 1991.<ref name=DO-1999 /><ref name=MusicMonitor-TurnLeft>{{cite web |last=Winkworth |first=Bruce |title=Go to the Country, Turn Left |url=http://www.penduluminc.com/MM/articles/lauderdale.html |work=The Music Monitor|access-date=December 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106152010/http://www.penduluminc.com/MM/articles/lauderdale.html|archive-date=November 6, 2006}}</ref> ''Lost in the Lonesome Pines'', a 2002 collaboration with [[Ralph Stanley]], won the [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]].

''Could We Get Any Closer?'' was nominated for a Grammy in 2009.

In 2013, Lauderdale released ''Old Time Angels'' (a bluegrass album) and his first solo acoustic album, ''Blue Moon Junction'', followed by ''Black Roses,'' with the [[North Mississippi All-Stars]].<ref name=Bristol-NewTunes-2014>{{cite web|last=Netherland|first=Tom|title=Lauderdale brings new tunes, standbys to town|url=http://www.tricities.com/news/local/article_39009100-792c-11e3-bbd5-0019bb30f31a.html|work=Tri Cities – Bristol Herald Courier (Bristol, VA)|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Lauderdale appears on [[Laura Cantrell]]'s 2013 release ''No Way There From Here''.<ref name=BW-Cantrell-2014>{{cite web|title=Laura Cantrell to Release New Album No Way There From Here, 1/28; Plays Joe's Pub in NYC, 1/29|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Laura-Cantrell-to-Release-New-Album-NO-WAY-THERE-FROM-HERE-128-Plays-Joes-Pub-in-NYC-129-20140107|work=Broadway World|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 7, 2014}}</ref> 2014 saw the release of his album ''I'm A Song''.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014>{{cite news|last=Zimmerman|first=Lee|title=Jim Lauderdale: "Slugging Along and Slugging It Out"|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2014/02/jim_lauderdale_interview_grassroots_festival_miami_2014.php|access-date=February 25, 2014|newspaper=[[Miami New Times]]|date=February 19, 2014}}</ref> Lauderdale will release his new album ''Time Flies'' on August 3, 2018, along with ''Jim Lauderdale and Roland White.''<ref name=RollingStone-2018>{{cite news|last=Gage|first=Jeff|title=Hear Americana King Jim Lauderdale's Rippling New Ballad 'Time Flies'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/hear-americana-king-jim-lauderdales-new-song-time-flies-w520371|access-date=May 23, 2018|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 16, 2018}}</ref>

=== Collaborations ===
In 2007, he began a collaboration with [[Larry Campbell]], the band Olabelle, and others in the ''American Beauty Project,'' a loose collection of musicians dedicated to reimagining in performance the [[Grateful Dead]]'s two classic 1970 albums, ''[[Workingman's Dead]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]''.

In 2011, Lauderdale toured with [[Hot Tuna]], an ensemble act that included [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Jack Casady]], Barry Mitterhof, [[G.E. Smith]], and, for a time, [[Charlie Musselwhite]]. He has also toured with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rhonda Vincent]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and others.

==== Dr. Ralph Stanley ====
Lauderdale wrote and produced two bluegrass records with [[Ralph Stanley]]. Their first collaboration, ''I Feel Like Singing Today'', was nominated for a Grammy.

==== Buddy Miller ====

Lauderdale released a record called ''Buddy and Jim'' with long-time friend and collaborator [[Buddy Miller]] in 2013.<ref name=NPR-Buddy&JimTDC>{{cite web|title=Buddy Miller & Jim Lauderdale: Tiny Desk Concert|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/183595144/buddy-miller-jim-lauderdale-tiny-desk-concert|work=Tiny Desk Concert|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|format=video performance and interview|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref> Lauderdale said they recorded it in three days in Miller's home studio. Miller did the mixing and producing.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Robert Hunter ====
Lauderdale has often collaborated with [[Grateful Dead]] lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]].<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

Lauderdale's first collaboration with Hunter was ''Headed for the Hills'' and the second was ''Patchwork River'' in May 2010. The June 2011 release ''Reason and Rhyme'' was their third collaboration. Additionally, they wrote songs for a [[North Mississippi Allstars]] record that was released in the fall of 2013.<ref name=TwangNation2013 />

Two 2013 releases, ''Black Roses'' and ''Blue Moon Junction,'' were co-written with Hunter. ''Black Roses'' features North Mississippi Allstars' Cody and [[Luther Dickinson]], whom Lauderdale met in Nashville at the Americana Music Festival,<ref name=CMTEdge-2014>{{cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Brian T.|title=Jim Lauderdale Teams Up for New Albums, Grammy Nod|url=http://www.cmtedge.com/2014/01/09/jim-lauderdale-teams-up-for-new-albums-grammy-nod/|work=CMT Edge|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] / [[Country Music Television|Country Music Television, Inc.]]|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref> as well as [[Muscle Shoals]] musicians [[Spooner Oldham]] and [[David Hood]]. The album was recorded at their father [[Jim Dickinson]]'s studio, Zebra Ranch in Mississippi.<ref name=CMTEdge-2014 />

2013's ''Blue Moon Junction'' features Lauderdale's work as a singer and songwriter, some of them co-written with Hunter in a solo, acoustic format. Lauderdale produced the record.<ref name=CMTEdge-2014 /> Lauderdale says that they have more material that might make a good follow-up album, and hopes they will have time to collaborate again soon.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Nick Lowe ====
Lauderdale performed solo as the opening act for [[Nick Lowe]] on the latter's 1995 tour of the U.S. and Europe with the Impossible Birds. He later recorded with longtime members of Lowe's band and other British musicians at London's Goldtop Studio, sessions resulting in the 2017 album ''London Southern''.<ref name=MiamiNewTimes-2014 />

==== Roland White ====

On August 3, 2018, Lauderdale released ''Jim Lauderdale and Roland White,'' a previously lost record made with mandolin master [[Roland White]]. The disc was recorded in Earl Scruggs' basement in 1979, and the songs were only found recently by White's wife.<ref name=RollingStone-2018/>

=== The Jim Lauderdale Phenomenon ===
The term "the Jim Lauderdale Phenomenon", coined by singer-songwriter [[Kim Richey]] and cited in an April 2000 article in ''[[The Tennessean]]'' by writer Peter Cooper, is an ironic reference to the fact that Lauderdale was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for his work with Stanley but was released from a record deal with [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA]] not long after. He was also released from contracts with Warner Bros., Columbia, and Atlantic Records.<ref name=Tennessean-RCA-drop>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Peter|title=Without 'star-level' clout, Lauderdale released from RCA|url=http://www.insurgentcountry.com/jim_lauderdale_dropped_from_rca.txt|work=[[The Tennessean]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221172233/http://www.insurgentcountry.com/jim_lauderdale_dropped_from_rca.txt|archive-date=February 21, 2001}}</ref><ref name=CL-Whisper-review>{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=James|title=Music: Jim Lauderdale, Whisper|url=http://web.cln.com/archives/atlanta/newsstand/030798/v_rec7.htm|work=[[Creative Loafing]]|access-date=December 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010222041342/http://web.cln.com/archives/atlanta/newsstand/030798/v_rec7.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2001}}</ref> The article notes that many country artists that were signed to major labels in the 1990s failed to get radio airtime and had their contracts dropped after making one or two albums.<ref name=Tennessean-RCA-drop/> The problem became widespread in Nashville during this period, when a lot of good music was being created and recorded, but the megastars dominated the airwaves.<ref name=DO-PenPal-1998>{{cite news|last=Rowland|first=Hobart|title=Pen pal: Jim Lauderdale is the write man in the wrong place|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1998-05-21/music/pen-pal/|access-date=December 14, 2013|newspaper=Dallas Observer|date=May 21, 1998}}</ref>

===2011–2012: ''A Farmhouse Christmas'' and ''His and Hers''===
On August 29, 2011, Joey + Rory released a new single, titled "Headache," to country radio, though it failed to chart and was not included on an album.

Joey + Rory's third studio album, ''[[His and Hers (album)|His and Hers]]'', was released on July 31, 2012.

'''John Driskell Hopkins''' (born May 3, 1971) is an American musician best known for his role as a founding member, vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter for the Grammy Award-winning group [[Zac Brown Band]]. Hopkins co-wrote, with [[Zac Brown]], Wyatt Durette, and [[Shawn Mullins]], the [[Zac Brown Band]]'s third single, "Toes", from their 2008 major-label debut ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]''. It was the second number-one single for the band. 
Hopkins also co-wrote, with Zac Brown, Wyatt Durette, and [[Sonia Leigh]], the second single from the band's third major-label album ''[[Uncaged]]'', entitled "[[Goodbye in Her Eyes]]".
Hopkins co-wrote the band's first number=one hit on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock chart]], "[[Heavy Is the Head (Zac Brown Band song)|Heavy Is the Head]]", which featured [[Chris Cornell]] and was the second single from their fourth major-label studio album, 2015's ''[[Jekyll + Hyde]]''.

==Early life==
Hopkins was raised in [[Gainesville, Georgia]], the eldest of four brothers. He graduated from [[Florida State University]] 1993 with a degree in general theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johndriskellhopkins.com/press |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=John Driskell Hopkins |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>
During college at Florida State University, Hopkins was the front man of a band called The Woodpeckers.

==Career==
After college, Hopkins moved to Atlanta. In 1996, he formed his rock band Brighter Shade, with whom he still plays. Brighter Shade recorded two albums by the early 2000s. During that time, Hopkins got involved with the production end of the scene: producing, recording, and collaborating on several projects in the Atlanta area, including one with Zac Brown.
After several years of friendship with Brown, in 2005, Hopkins joined the Zac Brown Band on bass guitar and vocals.
In 2011, Hopkins joined forces with bluegrass band [[Balsam Range]].  In January 2013, they released their debut CD called ''Daylight'' to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zacbrownband.com/john-driskell-hopkins.html |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=Zac Brown Band |access-date=2014-06-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001053/http://www.zacbrownband.com/john-driskell-hopkins.html |archive-date=2014-05-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johndriskellhopkins.com |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=John Driskell Hopkins |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>

In 2019, Hopkins, along with fellow musicians Greg Lee, Mike Rizzi, Mark Dannells, and Mick Murphy, a formed heavy rock band, The Bloody Wolves of Venice.  The Bloody Wolves of Venice released a five-song EP, ''The Revelation EP'', which was featured in the 2018 film ''Adolescence''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-03-04 |title=John Driskell Hopkins' Heavy Revelation With The Bloody Wolves Of Venice |url=https://atlantamusicgrapevine.com/2019/03/04/john-driskell-hopkins-heavy-revelation-with-the-bloody-wolves-of-venice/ |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=Atlanta Music Grapevine |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Collaborations===
Hopkins heard Balsam Range on bluegrass radio in 2011 and was so impressed, he immediately bought all their music. They later met and made an immediate personal and musical connection. They decided to join forces and record a CD. In September 2012, the album ''Daylight'' was completed, and officially released January 2013.
{{blockquote|If you drew line graphs plotting the changes each song brings to a CD – tempo, subject, mood … – some CDs would flatline and the majority would show moderate spikes up and down. Daylight's graph would look like the EKG of a person on speed, and every song is a good one. I hope Hopkins is already planning his next CD.<ref>Larry Stephens, ''The lonesome Road Review''</ref>}}

Balsam Range is a five-piece bluegrass powerhouse from [[Haywood County, North Carolina]], and include members Buddy Melton (fiddle, vocals), Darren Nicholson (mandolin, vocals), Marc Pruett (banjo), Caleb Smith (guitar, vocals), and Tim Surrett (bass, dobro, vocals). Their accolades include being voted Best Old-Time/Bluegrass Band of 2012 in Asheville's Mountain Xpress and receiving the [[International Bluegrass Music Awards|IBMA]] Song of the Year award for "Trains I Missed 2011" and the 2013 IBMA "Album of the Year" award for ''Papertown'', and  the 2014 IBMA "Entertainer of the Year". Hopkins and Balsam Range continue to play shows together often.

Dobro master and 14-time Grammy winner [[Jerry Douglas]] was also featured on Hopkins' 2013 release, ''Daylight''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Daylight – John Driskell Hopkins |url=https://johndriskellhopkins.com/music/daylight/ |access-date=2022-05-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2014, Hopkins has also collaborated with Georgia native bluegrass group the "[[Dappled Grays]]" on several shows, including two sold-out nights at the [[Georgia Theater]] opening for [[The String Cheese Incident]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://balsamrange.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Balsam Range |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>

===Brighter Shade===
Hopkins formed aggressive songwriter band [[Brighter Shade]] in 1996. The original line-up consisted of Hopkins on vocals and guitar, Andy Birdsall on vocals and guitar, Sean McIntyre on bass, and Marcus Petruska on drums. They recorded their eponymous debut album in 1996.

Later, a second line-up followed, featuring Hopkins and Birsdall, but added Wilder Embry on bass, Damian Cartier on keyboards, and John Woodward and Eric Sanders on drums. They recorded Brighter Shade's sophomore album, ''Divine Ignorance'', in 2001. Brighter Shade still plays periodic gigs in and around the Atlanta area.

Hopkins' recording studio, Brighter Shade Studios, shares the name of his band, and was where the Zac Brown album ''Home Grown'' was recorded in 1998. Brighter Shade Studios was also used in the recording of first two major albums of the Zac Brown Band - ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'' and ''[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/brightershade |title=Brighter Shade &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/m/cd/brightershade/from/greatindiemusic |title=CD Baby Mobile |publisher=Cdbaby.com |access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>

Their debut, ''Return of the Hellecasters'' (1993) won both "Album of the Year" and "Country Album of the Year" from ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine.

In 1994 he was invited to join Elton John's band for an 18-month tour. He remained with the band for the next six years, performing both live and in the studio, occasionally on saxophone. In 2002 he played bass guitar in the All-star Bluegrass Celebration in Nashville. Two years later he portrayed jazz guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] in the film ''[[Head in the Clouds (film)|Head in the Clouds]]''.

Jorgenson collaborated with [[Brad Paisley]], [[James Burton]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Albert Lee]], [[Brent Mason]], [[Redd Volkaert]] and [[Steve Wariner]] on the song "Cluster Pluck", on Paisley's album ''[[Play (Brad Paisley album)|Play]]'' (2009). The song won a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best Country Instrumental Performance category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=Jorgenson&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All&=Search |title=Past Winners Search |work=Grammy.com |access-date=August 14, 2015}}</ref>

He is a patron for [[Guitar-X]] ([[Tech Music Schools]]) in London, where he regularly visits to hold master classes. He is also a patron for [[Le QuecumBar]], the world's only music venue dedicated to Gypsy swing in London.

His [[gypsy jazz]] ensemble, ''[[John Jorgenson Quintet]]'' includes Doug Martin (rhythm guitar), [[Jason Anick]] (violin), Simon Planting (bass), and Rick Reed (percussion).

==Custom guitars==
[[Image:Jorgenson.jpg|right|thumb|220px|John Jorgenson performs in Liverpool (2006) with his Fender Hellecaster guitar.]]
G&L Guitars made a very few signature John Jorgenson ASAT guitars in Silver Sparkle with Silver Sparkle Pickguard, rosewood fretboard and Black ASAT Pickups in 1995.  Fender made signature guitar models for Jorgensen in 1997 and 1998. The Fender Limited Edition John Jorgenson Hellecaster was made in Japan in 1997. It features a black sparkle-finished maple body, vintage-tinted, high-gloss maple neck with reversed large-style Strat headstock, rosewood fretboard with gold sparkle dot inlays, 22 jumbo frets and Schaller locking tuners. Refinements included three [[Seymour Duncan]] custom-voiced, split-coil, hum-cancelling pickups which allow players to get controlled feedback in distortion mode and a custom-wired, five-way pickup selector switch with an additional push/pull control allowing seven tone variations. Other touches included a custom two-pivot-point tremolo, a Wilkinson "Wilkaloid" self-lubricating nut, gold sparkle pickguard and gold hardware.

The Fender John Jorgenson Signature Custom Korina Telecaster was made at the Fender Custom Shop in 1998, sporting a solid Korina body, a maple neck with pearloid dot inlays and a 25.5" scale length, African rosewood or an ebony on black finish fretboard with 22 Dunlop 6130 frets. Other features included dual side-by-side Telecaster humbucking pickups, a modified vintage style Tele bridge, a special custom five-way pickup switching featuring five different combinations (each in humbucking mode), 1.688" width at the nut and Sperzel Trimlok locking tuners.

In 1994, he became the third artist to have a custom signature series guitar built by [[Takamine Guitars]]. The JJ325SRC and the twelve-string JJ325SRC-12, born from the EF325SRCA, feature a spruce top with bubinga back and sides in a gloss red satin finish, a rosewood fretboard on a mahogany neck with his signature J.J. inlay on the 12th fret, and gold tubes with white pearloid knobs.<ref>{{cite web |title=John Jorgensen JJ325SRC & JJ325SRC-12 |url=https://www.takamine.com/signature-stories-model3 |publisher=Takamine}}</ref>

The most recent John Jorgenson signature guitar is the [[Fret-King]] FKV25JJ in Arcadian and Versailles Green. Designed in conjunction with Trev Wilkinson, the guitar is packed with a whole host of features including a chambered body, three self-intonating brass saddles, a matched, calibrated set of Wilkinson WVT pickups and two auxiliary ‘ghost’ coils which provide both hum-cancelling and classic single coil tones at the turn of a dial, thanks to the unique ‘Vari-coil’ control. John's Fret-King signature model will be joined by the FKV25JCAR in Candy Apple Red in 2019. 2019 will also see both Fret-King Jorgenson models shift from chambered to solid body construction.

'''Joshua Otis Turner''' (born November 20, 1977) is an American [[Country music|country]] singer and songwriter. In 2003, he signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville Records]]. That same year, his [[Long Black Train|debut album]]'s title track, "[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]", was his breakthrough single release. His second album, ''[[Your Man (album)|Your Man]]'' (2006) accounted for his first two No.&nbsp;1 hits, "[[Your Man (Josh Turner song)|Your Man]]" and "[[Would You Go with Me]]", while 2007's ''[[Everything Is Fine]]'' included a No.&nbsp;2 hit, "[[Firecracker (song)|Firecracker]]". ''[[Haywire (Josh Turner album)|Haywire]]'', released in 2010, produced his biggest hit, the four-week No.&nbsp;1 hit "[[Why Don't We Just Dance]]" and another No.&nbsp;1 song, "[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]". It was followed by ''[[Punching Bag (album)|Punching Bag]]'' (2012), whose lead-off single, "[[Time Is Love]]", was the biggest country hit of 2012 according to [[Billboard Year-End]].

==Early life==
Turner was born in [[Hannah, South Carolina]]. Growing up in the church, he founded a gospel quartet called Thankful Hearts, where he sang [[Bass (voice type)|bass]],<ref name=allmusic/> in addition to singing the bass part in choirs.<ref name="Bass11">{{cite web |first=Laura|last=Macmillan|title=11 of the Greatest and Most Famous Bass Singers of All Time|publisher=Hello Music Theory|date=3 June 2022 |url=https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/famous-bass-singers/}}</ref>

In 1996, Turner developed a lesion on his right vocal cord. Turner was examined by the [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] voice clinic, where doctors advised him to let it heal on its own. Surgery was not needed, but he did have to rest his voice for a year. While Turner rested his voice back at home, he learned classical vocal technique and how to take care of his voice and avoid developing further problems. Turner states that he "learned how to whistle really well during that year".<ref name="cmt20">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1484630/01272004/turner_josh.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212163020/http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1484630/01272004/turner_josh.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 12, 2004 |title=20 Questions With Josh Turner |website=CMT.com |date=2004-01-27 |access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>

After Hannah-Pamplico High School, he spent some time at [[Francis Marion University]] before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to enroll in [[Belmont University]] and pursue a career in music. After college, his fledgling career got a boost on December 21, 2001, during his debut on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], when he performed a song he wrote titled "[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]", which was inspired by [[Hank Williams]].<ref name=allmusic/> He received a standing ovation in the middle of the song, then sang it again for an encore.

==Career==

===2001–2004: ''Long Black Train''===
On December 21, 2001, Turner debuted on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] with the song "[[Long Black Train (song)|Long Black Train]]".

In 2003, Turner released his debut album, also entitled ''[[Long Black Train]]''. Prior to its release, Turner had released 7" vinyl singles of "She'll Go on You" and "Long Black Train". Both singles featured ''Long Black Train'' album track "Backwoods Boy" as a B-side. While neither "Backwoods Boy" nor "She'll Go on You" were successful (the latter peaking at No.&nbsp;46 on the country charts), "Long Black Train" spent more than forty weeks on the ''Billboard'' country charts, reaching a peak of No.&nbsp;13 and receiving a gold certification. The third single, "What It Ain't", was less successful, reaching No.&nbsp;31.

===2005–2006: ''Your Man''===
In early 2006, Turner released his second album, ''[[Your Man (album)|Your Man]]''. The album's first single and title track, "[[Your Man (Josh Turner song)|Your Man]]", was written by [[Jace Everett]], [[Chris DuBois]] and [[Chris Stapleton]] and released in late 2005. "Your Man" also climbed the charts slowly, eventually reaching No.&nbsp;1 in early 2006. ''Your Man'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]] four weeks after its release, and went [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] six months later.<ref name="RIAASearch">{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Josh%20Turner&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924153944/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Josh%20Turner&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-09-24|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - September 24, 2015| website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] }}</ref>

"[[Would You Go with Me]]" was the second single released from ''Your Man''. Like the album's title track, "Would You Go with Me" also reached the top of the country singles charts, holding that position for two weeks; it also reached No.&nbsp;48 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|'' Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Turner also performed it on the [[CMA Awards]] in November 2006.

Shortly after the album's release, a song called "[[Me and God]]" was released as a single to [[Christian radio]]. A duet with bluegrass musician [[Ralph Stanley]], the song also featured members of the band [[Diamond Rio]] on background vocals. "Me and God" reached a peak of No.&nbsp;16 on the country charts.

In December 2006, the 49th Annual [[Grammy Award]] nominations were announced. Turner received nods for [[Best Male Country Vocal Performance]] and for [[Best Country Album]]. That same month, a featurette on [[Country Music Television|CMT Insider]] showed Turner in the studio working on the album. He mentioned that he wanted it to sound like music in the 18th and 19th centuries. Turner performed at the Ryman Auditorium where a live album was recorded, singing a song called, "Church in the Holler". Turner's album ''Josh Turner: Live At The Ryman'' was recorded in April and is available exclusively through [[Cracker Barrel]] restaurants.

Turner, along with veteran songwriters [[Brett James]] and [[Don Schlitz]], wrote a song entitled "Say Yes"; recorded and released by singer [[Dusty Drake]] in 2007, the song was a minor Top 40 country hit for Drake, peaking at No.&nbsp;36.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dustydrake.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id%3D3683 |title=Dusty Drake |access-date=2007-04-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123163315/http://dustydrake.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=3683 |archive-date=2006-11-23 }}</ref>

He was inducted by [[Vince Gill]] on October 27, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryhound.com/News/Article.aspx?p%3D476%26AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3D1 |title=Country Hound - Josh Turner to Become Grand Ole Opry Member |access-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025025450/http://www.countryhound.com/News/Article.aspx?p=476 |archive-date=2007-10-25 }}</ref> At the time, he and [[Carrie Underwood]] were the youngest members of the Opry.

==Career==
===1984–1986: First two albums===
Mattea's [[Kathy Mattea (album)|self-titled debut album]] came out in 1984,<ref name="allmusic"/> with Hill and Rick Peoples as the album's producers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1984/07/21/page/14/article/italian-american-mattea-moves-into-hit-country|title=Italian-American Mattea moves into hit country|last=Hurst|first=Jack|date=July 21, 1984|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|pages=14, 16|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref> Mattea later noted that "there were no budgets" when she was recording the album, as she was unable to afford a $75 makeup session, and the front cover featured her wearing a jacket which she had purchased at [[Kmart (United States)|Kmart]].<ref name="definitive"/> In addition, Mattea was given advice from image consultants on her musical persona. According to Mattea, she did not have an "artistic vision" at the time, which accounted for a lack of artistic identity.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=415-416}}

Four of its singles made the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, starting with "[[Street Talk (song)|Street Talk]]", which charted at number 25.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=210}} Mattea had originally recorded a demo of the song with the intent of having [[Terri Gibbs]] record it, but Mattea kept it for herself when Gibbs declined the song.<ref name="definitive"/> Followup "[[Someone Is Falling in Love]]" (written by [[Pebe Sebert]]) made it to number 26 on the same chart, while "You've Got a Soft Place to Fall" and "That's Easy for You to Say" fell short of the top 40.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=210}} Other notable cuts on the album included "God Ain't No Stained Glass Window", which was released as a 12" promotional single for the Christmas season;<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kirby|first=Kip|date=December 22, 1984|title=Nashville Scene|magazine=Billboard|page=47|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/80s/1984/BB-1984-12-22.pdf}}</ref> a cover version of [[Barry Manilow]]'s 1981 hit "[[Somewhere Down the Road (Barry Manilow song)|Somewhere Down the Road]]";<ref name="mattea people">{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-kathy-mattea-vol-21-no-14/|title=Picks and Pans Review: Kathy Mattea|last=Novak|first=Ralph|date=April 9, 1984|work=People|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref> and "[[(Back to the) Heartbreak Kid]]", which later became a Top 10 hit on the country charts for [[Restless Heart]] in late 1985 to early 1986.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=279}} [[Allmusic]] reviewer William Ruhlmann wrote of the album that it was "a fairly representative sampling of Nashville formula country writing", while praising the "feisty" nature of "Street Talk" and Mattea's vocals on "Heartbreak Kid".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/kathy-mattea-mw0000197442|title=''Kathy Mattea'' review|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|work=Allmusic|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref> ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' reviewer Ralph Novak compared Mattea's voice favorably to [[Anne Murray]] and said that "Mattea may not have the most revolutionary sound around, but her material is especially good."<ref name="mattea people"/>

Her second album, ''[[From My Heart]]'', was also her first under the production of [[Allen Reynolds]],<ref name="heart billboard"/><ref name="heart">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/from-my-heart-mw0000315603|title=''From My Heart''|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|work=Allmusic|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref> who is best known for his work with [[Crystal Gayle]] and [[Garth Brooks]]. Released in 1985, it produced the chart singles "[[It's Your Reputation Talkin']]", "[[He Won't Give In]]", and "Heart of the Country", which peaked at numbers 34, 22, and 46 respectively on Hot Country Songs.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=210}} It also featured a cover of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Ball and Chain (Elton John song)|Ball and Chain]]", from his 1982 album ''[[Jump Up! (Elton John album)|Jump Up!]]''<ref name="heart"/> Ruhlmann found this album superior to its predecessor, stating that Reynolds "seems to have shaped the song selections to the singer's talents and given her the opportunity to sing in a more individual manner."<ref name="heart"/> A review of the album in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' was also positive, noting the "more focused direction and a simpler, purer sound".<ref name="heart billboard">{{cite magazine|date=March 30, 1985|title=Reviews|magazine=Billboard|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yMEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22kathy+mattea%22+%22From+my+heart%22&pg=PT149}}</ref>

===1986–1990: Breakthrough===
Mattea's artistic vision developed with the making of her third album, which brought in folk and acoustic sounds (inspired by her childhood).{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=416}} Her third album, ''[[Walk the Way the Wind Blows]]'' (1986) was (according to AllMusic) "her breakthrough both critically and commercially".<ref name="allmusic"/> Four singles were released from the album.

===1990{{ndash}}1993: Continued success===
Later in 1990, Mattea released her first greatest hits album, ''[[A Collection of Hits]]''. The album included eight of her previous singles, plus "The Battle Hymn of Love" from ''Untasted Honey'' and the new recording "[[A Few Good Things Remain]]". Both were released as singles in 1990 and reached the Top 10 of Hot Country Songs, with "The Battle Hymn of Love" representing O'Brien's only chart entry to date.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=210}} "A Few Good Things Remain" was also featured on her next studio album, 1991's ''[[Time Passes By]]''.

Her 1992 album, ''[[Lonesome Standard Time]]'', produced a number 11 country hit in its [[Lonesome Standard Time (song)|title track]], plus the Top 20 "[[Standing Knee Deep in a River (Dying of Thirst)]]". Yet its followups ("Seeds" and "Listen to the Radio") failed to enter the country top 40.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=210}} This was also her first album to be produced by [[Brent Maher]], best known for his work with [[The Judds]].<ref name="cd">{{cite journal|title=Lonesome Standard Time|journal=CD Review|volume=9|issue=1–6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSU9AQAAIAAJ&q=%22kathy+mattea%22+%22Lonesome+standard+time%22+%22maher%22|year=1992}}</ref> Nash rated it "B", saying that "not even the driving bluegrass of the title tune is enough to transcend the album’s ultrareflective mood.

After recovering, she issued her first Christmas album, ''[[Good News (Kathy Mattea album)|Good News]]'', in September 1993. It featured largely original compositions, plus renditions of the hymn "[[Brightest and Best]]" and the contemporary Christian tune "[[Mary, Did You Know?]]" Thom Jurek wrote of its sound, "This doesn't feel like any Christmas record you've ever heard before...It sounds like a well-crafted, gorgeously wrought folk/country/Celtic-flavored Kathy Mattea record."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/good-news-mw0000103930|title=''Good News''|last=Jurek|first=Thom|work=Allmusic|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref> This album won that year's [[Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album]].<ref name="Grammy">{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/kathy-mattea|title=Grammy results for Kathy Mattea|work=grammy.com|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref> Maher again served as producer, with further production from Reynolds on one track.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Good News |others=Kathy Mattea |year=1993 |publisher=Mercury Records |id=314 518 059 2}}</ref>

It was followed by the [[Love Travels (song)|title track]], which reached the top 40.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=210}} Mattea noted that in the process of recording "455 Rocket," the band recorded multiple takes but chose to keep the first one because "no one thought they were being recorded, and everyone was just playing with abandon."<ref name="definitive"/> Musicians on this album included bassist [[Hutch Hutchinson]], drummers [[Abe Laboriel Jr.]] and [[Jim Keltner]], and guitarist [[Duke Levine]]; contributing backing vocalists included [[Kim Richey]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Jonatha Brooke]], and [[Mary Ann Kennedy (American singer)|Mary Ann Kennedy]].

Her last Mercury album was ''[[The Innocent Years]]'' in 2000. Before the album's release, Mattea returned to West Virginia to care for her father, who had been diagnosed with colon cancer.

I think this is an album about those things."<ref name="cst"/> Although Mattea rarely writes her material, she wrote two songs on the album with Vezner.<ref name="cst"/> The album's final track, a novelty song called "BFD", was included as a bonus track because it was popular with fans, but she was unsure of how to sequence it with the rest of the album.<ref name="cst">{{cite journal|title=Kathy Mattea lives through the innocent years|last=Remz|first=Jeffrey B.|journal=Country Standard Time}} [http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=587 Page 1], [http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/articlex.asp?xid=587&p=2 page 2], [http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/articlex.asp?xid=587&p=3 page 3]</ref> "The Trouble with Angels" and "BFD" made the Hot Country Songs charts in 2000, although neither made Top 40.{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=210}} ''Country Standard Time'' reviewer Eli Messinger wrote that "though the smooth sound and heart-on-her-sleeve lyrics may not be for the country roots fan...Mattea's superb voice and mature readings are clearly the work of an accomplished artist chasing her musical muse."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1616|title=''The Innocent Years''|last=Messinger|first=Eli|work=Country Standard Time|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref>

===2002–present: Music transition and bluegrass===
For 2002's ''[[Roses (Kathy Mattea album)|Roses]]'', Mattea moved to [[Narada Productions]]. She said that she chose to work with this label after leaving Mercury because she felt that the label would "give [her] alternative marketing ideas" and "didn't see [her] musical restlessness as a liability". She said that she wanted to keep a contemporary folk and Celtic influence. Mattea supported the album with a tour largely focused on performing arts centers.

The bluegrass album ''[[Coal (Kathy Mattea album)|Coal]]'' followed in 2008. Mattea released this album independently on her own Captain Potato Records.

In the mid 2010s, Mattea began having problems with gaining control of her singing voice.

Mattea is known for her roles in AIDS activism. In 1992, many televised awards shows were handing out red ribbons to participants in honor of AIDS awareness, but the [[Country Music Association]] chose to hand out green ribbons promoting environmental awareness instead. Mattea chose to wear three red ribbons that night, each one honoring a friend of hers who had died of the disease, along with the green ribbon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2006/7/23/229961/-|title=Liberal Country Artist of the Week: Kathy Mattea|date=July 23, 2006|work=Daily KOS|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> A 1994 article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' noted that a Nashville newspaper interpreted a comment she had made on wearing both color ribbons as a confrontation, and that Mattea was often questioned as to whether her activism had a negative impact on sales of her then-current album.<ref name="cameo"/> Besides her participation in the ''Red Hot + Country'' charity album series, Mattea also participated in charity concerts and made public appearances in activism campaigns.

'''Jackie Keith Whitley''' (July 1, 1954 – May 9, 1989) was an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. During his career, he released only two albums but charted 12 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, and 7 more after his death.

Born in [[Ashland, Kentucky]], Whitley grew up in nearby [[Sandy Hook, Kentucky]]. He began his career there in 1970, performing in [[Ralph Stanley]]'s band. Establishing himself as a lead singer in bluegrass music, Whitley moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1983 and began his recording career there. His first Top 20 Country Hit single, "[[Miami, My Amy]]", was released in 1986. In 1988, his first three singles from his studio album ''[[Don't Close Your Eyes (album)|Don't Close Your Eyes]]'', the [[Don't Close Your Eyes (Keith Whitley song)|title song]], "[[When You Say Nothing at All]]" and "[[I'm No Stranger to the Rain]]" were number one hits. Years of alcoholism severely compromised his health and he died of alcohol intoxication in 1989 at his Goodlettsville home at the age of 34. His later singles, "[[I Wonder Do You Think of Me (song)|I Wonder Do You Think of Me]]",  "[[It Ain't Nothin']]", and "[[I'm Over You (Keith Whitley song)|I'm Over You]]", were released after his death.

In 2022, Whitley was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name="cmhof">{{cite web | url=https://eu.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/country-music-hall-fame-class-2022-inductees/9805843002/ | title=Keith Whitley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Joe Galante are headed to the Country Music Hall of Fame }}</ref>

==Early life==
Whitley was born to Faye Ferguson (editor of ''The Elliott County News'') and Elmer Whitley (an electrician) in [[Ashland, Kentucky]], but was raised 46 miles away in [[Sandy Hook, Kentucky|Sandy Hook]], and attended Sandy Hook High School.<ref name=HicksJ-TKP-1991-09-25>Hicks, Jack. – "Singer Keith Whitley's Memory Alive Through Songs, Love in Home Town". – ''[[The Cincinnati Post|The Kentucky Post]]''. – September 25, 1991.</ref><ref name=LH-L-1989-05-10>"Country Music Star Keith Whitley Dead at 33". – ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]''. – May 10, 1989.</ref> He had two brothers, Randy and Dwight, and a sister, Mary.<ref name=LockwoodFE-LH-L-1998-06-27>Lockwood, Frank E. – "Bikers, Sandy Hook Pay Tribute to Favorite Son". – Lexington Herald-Leader (KY) – Saturday, June 27, 1998.</ref><ref name=LockwoodFE-LH-L-1999-06-28>Lockwood, Frank E. – "Singing in Rain". – Lexington Herald-Leader (KY) – Saturday, June 28, 1999.</ref> The Whitley family is of [[English Americans|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] descent and has lived in the [[Elliott County, Kentucky|Elliott County]] area since the 1840s.

While Whitley was a teenager in Sandy Hook, he and his friends would pass the time drinking [[Rum-running|bootleg]] [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] and racing their cars down mountain roads at dangerous speeds. Whitley was once in a car whose driver attempted to round a curve at {{convert|120|mph|kph}}. The car wrecked, killing his friend and almost breaking Whitley's neck. In another incident, he drove his car off a {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=on}} cliff into a frozen river, escaping with only a broken [[collar bone]].<ref name=AP>Associated Press – "Whitley Just Getting Started Despite 18-Year Music Career". – Salina Journal (KS) – Thursday, October 27, 1988.</ref>

Whitley's older brother Randy was killed in an October 1983 motorcycle accident.<ref name="HicksJ-TKP-1991-09-25" /><ref name="LockwoodFE-LH-L-1998-06-27" />

==Musical career==
Whitley is known for his neotraditional brand of country popularized by hit artists such as [[George Strait]] and [[Randy Travis]].

In 1969, he performed in a musical contest in [[Ezel, Kentucky]], with brother Dwight on five-string banjo. [[Ricky Skaggs]] was also in the contest. Skaggs and Whitley instantly bonded and subsequently became close friends.<ref name=RoweN-RT-D-1986-04-20>Rowe, Norman. – Album Echoes Country Classics". – ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''. – April 20, 1986</ref>

Whitley and Skaggs, both sixteen years old, were discovered in Ft. Gay, West Virginia, by [[Ralph Stanley]], who was 45 minutes late for a gig due to a flat tire.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Stanley opened the door of the club and heard what he thought was the [[Stanley Brothers]] playing on a jukebox. However, it was Whitley and Skaggs, who "sounded just like me and Carter in the early days".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The two soon joined Stanley's band. Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Whitley also played with [[J.D. Crowe & the New South]] in the mid-1970s.<ref name=AP/> During this period, he established himself as one of the most versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass. His singing was heavily influenced by [[Carter Stanley]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]]. He moved to [[Nashville]] in 1983 to pursue a country music career and soon signed a record deal with [[RCA Records]].<ref name=AP/>

Whitley's first solo album, ''A Hard Act to Follow'', was released in 1984, and featured a more mainstream country style. While Whitley was working hard to achieve his own style, the songs he produced were inconsistent. Critics regarded the album as too erratic. Whitley honed his sound within the next few years for his next album, ''L.A. to Miami''.

''L.A. to Miami'', released in 1985, would give him his first Top 20 country hit single, "Miami, My Amy". The song was followed by three more hit songs: "Ten Feet Away", "Homecoming '63", and "Hard Livin'", The album also included "[[On the Other Hand]]" and "[[Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her]]". "On the Other Hand" was pitched to Whitley before [[Randy Travis]] released the song as a single and when Whitley's version wasn't released as a single, Travis released his in 1986, as did [[George Strait]] with "Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her".

During his tour to promote ''L.A. to Miami'', he met and began a romantic relationship with country singer [[Lorrie Morgan]]. They were married in November 1986 and  had their only child, a son, Jesse Keith Whitley in June 1987. Whitley also adopted Lorrie's daughter, Morgan, from her first marriage.

During the new recording sessions in 1987, Whitley began feeling that the songs he was  were not up to his standards, so he approached RCA and asked if the project of 15 songs could be shelved. He also asked if he could take a major role in creating the songs and in production. The new album, titled ''[[Don't Close Your Eyes (album)|Don't Close Your Eyes]]'', was released in 1988, and the album sold extremely well. The album contained one of the many songs that Whitley had a hand in writing in his years at Tree Publishing, "It's All Coming Back to Me Now". On the album was a remake of [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s classic standard "I Never Go Around Mirrors," and the song became a huge hit at Whitley's concerts. The first three singles from the album—"When You Say Nothing at All," "I'm No Stranger to the Rain," and the title cut—all reached No. 1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s country charts during the autumn of 1988 and the winter of 1989, with the title track "Don't Close Your Eyes" being ranked as ''Billboard''’s No. 1 Country song of 1988. Shortly thereafter, "I'm No Stranger to the Rain" also earned Whitley his first and only [[Country Music Association]] award as a solo artist and a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]].

In early 1989, Whitley approached RCA chairman [[Joe Galante]] with the intention of releasing "I Never Go Around Mirrors" as a single. Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song; however, he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat. The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called ''[[I Wonder Do You Think of Me]]'', and was to result in his next album release.

Whitley was scheduled to be invited to join the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in late May 1989. He was posthumously inducted as a former member on October 14, 2023, in a tribute concert held during that night's ''Opry'' broadcast.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Keith Whitley to be celebrated by Garth Brooks, more, at October Opry event |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/09/15/keith-whitley-to-be-celebrated-by-garth-brooks-more-at-october-opry-event/70863977007/ |access-date=2023-10-15 |website=The Tennessean |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Death==
On May 9, 1989, Whitley had a brief phone call with his mother and was later visited by his brother-in-law, Lane Palmer.  The two had coffee and were planning a day of golf and lunch, after which Whitley planned to start writing songs for him and Lorrie Morgan to record when she returned from her concert tour. Palmer left at approximately {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.}},<ref name=JinkinsS-FWST-1997-10-14>Jinkins, Shirley. – "A country music love story of death, drinking and devotion". – ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''. – October 14, 1997.</ref> asking Whitley to be ready to leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley unresponsive on his bed and called an ambulance. Whitley was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. He was 34.

The official cause of death was acute ethanolism ([[alcohol poisoning]]).<ref name=LH-L-1989-05-10 /> [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] Medical Examiner Charles Harlan stated that Whitley's blood alcohol level was 0.47 (the equivalent of 20 one-ounce shots of 100-[[proof (alcohol)|proof]] whiskey).<ref>"Alcohol Cuts Short a promising career". – [[Associated Press]]. – (c/o ''[[Salina Journal]]''). – August 10, 1989.</ref><ref>Edwards, Joe. – "Keith Whitley discovered dead – Alcohol overdose cause of death". – ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''. – May 10, 1989.</ref><ref name=AP-CT-1989-05-10>"Country Singer Keith Whitley, 33". – [[Associated Press]]. – (c/o ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''). – May 10, 1989.</ref><ref>Hurst, Jack. – "Whitley's Last Days". – ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. – May 14, 1989.</ref><ref>Green, Barbara. – "Whitley Fans Hate 'To See a Good Man Go To Waste". – ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''. – May 17, 1989.</ref> He was born in 1954 per his birth certificate and passport, but RCA and his [[Headstone|grave marker]] erroneously recorded his birth year as 1955.<ref name=WhitburnJ-TBBofT40CH-p382>Whitburn, Joel (2006). – ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits''. – Second Edition. – New York: Billboard Books. – p.382. – {{ISBN|978-0-8230-8291-9}}.</ref><ref name="Birth-Year">Stambler, Irwin, and Grelun Landon (2000). – ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia''. – New York: St. Martin's Press. – p.533. – {{ISBN|978-0-312-26487-1}}.<br />—Carlin, Richard (2003). – ''Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary''. – New York: Routledge – p.427. – {{ISBN|978-0-415-93802-0}}.<br />—Larkin, Colin (1995). – ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. – New York: Stockton Press – P.4462. – {{ISBN|978-0-85112-662-3}}.<br />—Stanton, Scott (2003). – ''The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians''. – New York: Pocket Books. – p.395. – {{ISBN|978-0-7434-6330-0}}.<br />—Hicks, Jack. – "Singer Keith Whitley's Memory Alive Through Songs, Love in Home Town". – ''[[The Cincinnati Post|The Kentucky Post]]''. – September 25, 1991.<br />—"Country Music Star Keith Whitley Dead at 33". – ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]''. – May 10, 1989.<br />—Hurst, Jack. – "Whitley's Last Days". – ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. – May 14, 1989.<br />—"Alcohol Kills Country Singer Keith Whitley". – [[United Press International]]. – (c/o ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''). – May 10, 1989.</ref>

The day after his death, [[Music Row]] was lined with black ribbons in memory of Whitley. He is buried in the [[Spring Hill Cemetery (Nashville)|Spring Hill Cemetery]] outside [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. His gravestone reads, "Forever yours faithfully" (part one) and "His being was my reason" (part two).

==Posthumous releases==
At the time of his death, Whitley had just finished work on his third and final studio album, ''[[I Wonder Do You Think of Me]]''. The album was released three months after his death, on August 1, 1989. The album produced two more No.&nbsp;1 hits, with the title track and "It Ain't Nothin'." "I'm Over You" also was in the Top 5 in early 1990, reaching No. 3.

Two new songs were added to "Greatest Hits": The first, "Tell Lorrie I Love Her" was written and recorded at home by Whitley for Morgan, originally intended as a work tape for Whitley's friend Curtis 'Mr. Harmony' Young to sing at Whitley's wedding. The second was "'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose", a 1987 demo taken from Tree that originally featured harmony vocals by childhood friend Ricky Skaggs. Lorrie Morgan, with creative control and license to Whitley's namesake, recorded her voice alongside Whitley's, and released it as a single, which rose to No. 13 and won them 1990's CMA award for Best Vocal Collaboration as well as a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].

RCA also released a compilation of performance clips (from his days in the Ralph Stanley-Fronted Clinch Mountain Boys), interviews, and some previously unreleased material under the title "Kentucky Bluebird". The album produced hits for Whitley as well, including a duet with [[Earl Thomas Conley]], named "Brotherly Love," which peaked at No. 2 in late 1991 and gave Whitley his second consecutive posthumous Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].

In 1994, Whitley's widow, Lorrie Morgan, organized several of Whitley's friends in bluegrass and some of the big names in country at the time to record a [[tribute]] album to Whitley. The album, ''[[Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album]]'', was released in September 1994 via BNA. It included covers of Whitley's songs from artists such as [[Alan Jackson]], [[Diamond Rio]], and Ricky Skaggs. The album also included four previously unreleased tracks recorded by Whitley in 1987, one of which had Morgan dubbed in as a duet partner. The album also included two original songs: "Little Boy Lost", co-written and sung by [[Daron Norwood]], and "A Voice Still Rings True", a multi-artist song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1994/08/11/crowning-touch-3/|title=Crowning Touch 'Red Hot + Country' Album Delayed To Include Crosby, Stills And Nash|last=Hurst|first=Jack|date=August 11, 1994|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=February 17, 2014}}</ref> [[Alison Krauss]]'s rendition of "When You Say Nothing at All" was released as a single from the album, reaching number 3 on the country charts in 1995.

In 1995, the album ''Wherever You Are Tonight'' was released, produced by Lorrie Morgan, featuring restored demos of 1986–1988, with crisper 1990s recording techniques and a full orchestra. The album and single of the same name both did very well on the Billboard and R&R charts and "Super Hits" and "The Essential Keith Whitley" followed in 1996. "The Essential" contained the remastered and long since unavailable LP and Whitley's debut, the 6-Track "A Hard Act to Follow", and a scrapped song from 1986's "LA to Miami", "I Wonder Where You Are Tonight".

==Legacy==
Several film projects depicting Whitley's life were slated, but none have come to fruition. One idea was a film version of the George Vescey-Lorrie Morgan-penned ''Forever Yours, Faithfully''. While Morgan's book was a benchmark in piecing together Whitley's final moments, perhaps the most research went into a project titled ''Kentucky Bluebird'', which was to star writer/actor/director [[David L. Keith|David Keith]]. This project was in [[development hell]] for several years, and was halted in late 2006 after difficulties with casting and funding. Another film project, started in 2004 by songwriter Jeff Swope, was a biopic chronicling Whitley's life and passing. The last information about the project came in 2010, when he announced that pre-production was set to begin, pending investors.<ref>Mirrors, The Keith Whitley Story – [[WordPress]], April 13, 2010</ref>

Whitley is the only person to be posthumously recognized as a former member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]], without ever being an active member. Management had scheduled Whitley for an appearance in late May 1989, where he was to be invited to join, but his death on May 9 interrupted those plans. As the Opry has a policy only inducting living artists as members, Whitley's induction was scrapped. During a Keith Whitley tribute show at the Opry on October 14, 2023, [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Lorrie Morgan]] announced that Whitley's name would be engraved on a plaque and included in the Opry's Member Gallery backstage, alongside every act who has held Opry membership at some point in the show's history, dating to 1925.

==Biography and career==
Leslie grew up in her birthplace of [[Paris, Texas|Paris]], Texas, United States, where she sang in local churches and schools – an experience which she lists as one of her biggest influences.<ref>{{cite web| title = Letters From Leslie| publisher = [[Country Music Television]]| year = 2001| url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472356/20030606/satcher_leslie.jhtml| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040721/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472356/20030606/satcher_leslie.jhtml| url-status = dead| archive-date = September 30, 2007| accessdate = June 21, 2007  }}</ref> In 1989, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue her dream of being a country music singer, but found a niche writing the songs for which she is most well known – including many by notable country music acts like [[Patty Loveless]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Reba McEntire]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Tarradell| first = Mario| title = This train is bound for glory| publisher = [[Dallas Morning News]]| date = April 2, 2002}}</ref><ref name="leg">{{cite web| title = H.C.R.

In 2002, [[Martina McBride]]'s performance of her song "[[When God-Fearin' Women Get the Blues]]" reached No.&nbsp;8 in the United States, while her 2006 song "Politically Uncorrect", performed by [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Gretchen Wilson]], reached No.&nbsp;23 and was nominated for a Grammy award.<ref>{{cite web| title = Students to perform at Country Music Hall of Fame| publisher = [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]| date = April 2, 2006| url = http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/news_detail.aspx?cid=2025| accessdate = June 21, 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070501201911/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/news_detail.aspx?cid=2025| archivedate = May 1, 2007}}</ref>

'''Lester Raymond Flatt''' (June 19, 1914 – May 11, 1979)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lester-Flatt|title=Lester Flatt &#124; American musician|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|access-date=August 28, 2021}}</ref> was an American [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]] guitarist and mandolinist, best known for his collaboration with banjo picker [[Earl Scruggs]] in the duo [[Flatt and Scruggs]].

Flatt's career spanned multiple decades, breaking out as a member of [[Bill Monroe]]'s band during the 1940s and including multiple solo and collaboration works exclusive of Scruggs. He first reached a mainstream audience through his performance on "[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]", the theme for the network television series ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', in the early 1960s.

==Biography==
[[File:Earl Scruggs and Lester Flatt.jpg|thumb|left|Lester Flatt (right) with [[Earl Scruggs]] (left) as part of [[Flatt and Scruggs]] in 1949]]
Flatt was born in Duncan's Chapel, [[Overton County, Tennessee]], United States,<ref name=browne>{{cite book |editor1-last=Browne |editor1-first=Ray B. |editor2-last=Browne |editor2-first=Pat |url={{Google books|U3rJxPYT32MC|page=284|plainurl=yes}} |chapter=Flatt and Scruggs |title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture |publisher=[[Popular Press]] |year=2001 |page=284 |isbn=978-0879728212}}</ref> to Nannie Mae Haney and Isaac Columbus Flatt. In 1943, he played [[mandolin]] and sang [[tenor]] in The Kentucky Pardners, the band of [[Bill Monroe]]'s older brother [[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flatt-and-scruggs.com/lesterbio.html |title=Biography: Lester Flatt |website=Flatt-and-scruggs.com |access-date=June 6, 2020}}</ref> He first came to prominence as a member of [[Bill Monroe]]'s Blue Grass Boys in 1945 and played a thumb-and-index guitar style that was in part derived from the playing of Charlie Monroe and Clyde Moody. In 1948, he started a band with fellow Monroe alumnus [[Earl Scruggs]], and for the next 20 years, [[Flatt and Scruggs]] and the Foggy Mountain Boys were one of the most successful bands in bluegrass.<ref name=ecm>{{cite book |last=Rosenberg |first=Neil V. |year=1998 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLZz02EzmBYC&pg=PT504 |chapter=Flatt & Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys |title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=173–4 |isbn=978-0195395631}}</ref> When they parted ways in 1969, Flatt formed a new group, the [[Nashville Grass]], hiring many of the Foggy Mountain Boys. He continued to record and perform with that group until his death in 1979.<ref name=ecm2>{{cite book |last=Samuelson |first=Dave |year=1998 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLZz02EzmBYC&pg=PT504 |chapter=Lester Flatt & the Nashville Grass |title= The Encyclopedia of Country Music |editor-first=Paul |editor-last=Kingsbury |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=173 |isbn=978-0195395631}}</ref> His role as rhythm guitarist and vocalist in each of these seminal ensembles helped define the sound of traditional bluegrass music. His solid guitar playing and rich lead voice are unmistakable in hundreds of bluegrass standards. He is also remembered for his library of compositions.

==Death and legacy==
Flatt died of heart failure in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 64.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/12/archives/lester-flatt-singer-and-guitarist-in-duo-with-earl-scruggs-dies.html |title=Lester Flatt, Singer and Guitarist in Duo With Earl Scruggs, Dies |first=John |last=Rockwell |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=26 |date=May 12, 1979}}</ref>

He was posthumously inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1985 along with Scruggs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/flatt-and-scruggs |title=Flatt and Scruggs |website=[[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] |access-date=August 15, 2016}}</ref> Flatt was also posthumously inducted as an inaugural member of the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] in 1991.

Lester's hometown of [[Sparta, Tennessee]], held a bluegrass festival in his honor for a number of years, before being discontinued a few years prior to the death of the traditional host, resident Everette Paul England; Lester Flatt Memorial Bluegrass Day remains part of the annual Liberty Square Celebration held in Sparta.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastpublicrelations.com/lester_flatt_memorial_bluegrass.htm |title=Lester Flatt Memorial Bluegrass Day |website=East Public Relations |date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205192520/http://www.eastpublicrelations.com/lester_flatt_memorial_bluegrass.htm |archive-date=December 5, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Flatt and Scruggs were ranked No. 24 on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music in 2003.

'''Lloyd Wayne Maines''' (born June 28, 1951) is an American [[country music]] record producer, musician and songwriter. He was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame as one of the first three members, the other two being [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. He is the father of [[Natalie Maines]] who is best known as the lead singer of [[The Chicks]].

==Life and career==
Maines was born and raised in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]], and is now based in [[Bulverde, Texas|Austin, Texas]].

Arguably best known as a [[pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] player, Maines is a multi-instrumentalist who has also performed and/or recorded playing [[dobro]], electric and acoustic guitar, [[mandolin]], [[lap steel guitar]], [[banjo]] and [[bell tree]]. He toured and recorded as a member of the [[Joe Ely]] Band and has also played with [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Butch Hancock]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]], [[Golden Bear (band)|Golden Bear]],<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r846134/credits|pure_url=yes}} Golden Bear album credits], [[AllMusic]]</ref> and other Texas musicians.  Maines was a member of [[The Maines Brothers Band]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s and has contributed to [[alt-country]] releases, including [[Uncle Tupelo]]'s ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'' and [[Wilco]]'s debut, ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|AM]]''.

Maines began producing some of his own music, branching out beginning with other country artists, early on starting with [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]]'s seminal 1979 album, ''[[Lubbock (On Everything)]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lloyd Maines: A Driving Force In Texas Music |author=Harrington, AnnMarie |date=April 2002 |publisher=Take Country Back |url=http://www.takecountryback.com/features/lloydmaines.htm |access-date=September 3, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811203441/http://www.takecountryback.com/features/lloydmaines.htm |archive-date=August 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He has produced and worked on recording projects with numerous artists, including the [[Bad Livers]], [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]], [[Roger Creager]], [[Anna Fermin]]'s Trigger Gospel, [[Pat Green]], [[Butch Hancock]], [[Wayne Hancock]], [[Terri Hendrix]],<ref name=TerriHendrix_WebsiteHome>{{cite web| publisher=Terri Hendrix| title=Live from Wilory Farm Tonight!| url=https://www.terrihendrix.com/| date=April 29, 2020| accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref> [[Rita Hosking]], [[Ray Wylie Hubbard]], [[Intocable]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], the [[Lost Gonzo Band]], [[Bob Livingston (musician)|Bob Livingston]], [[Charlie Robison]], [[Owen Temple]], [[Two Tons of Steel]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[The Waybacks]], [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]] and [[Martin Zellar]]. He frequently tours with Terri Hendrix throughout the United States, and is a major part of her band and production as an artist.

Maines won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album]] in 2003 as producer of the album ''[[Home (The Chicks album)|Home]]'' by [[The Chicks]]' (formerly known as the [[Dixie Chicks]]). As the father of [[Natalie Maines]], lead singer of The Chicks, he was instrumental in bringing the current lineup of bandmates together in 1995, which jump-started their sudden popularity and change in sound. [[Susan Gibson]]'s "[[Wide Open Spaces (song)|Wide Open Spaces]]", which had been sent to Maines, proved to be a hit from their debut album, and has remained their [[signature song]].

As of 2020, Lloyd Maines, on guitars, has accompanied singer/songwriter [[Terri Hendrix]] live and in recordings since 1997 and her second album.<ref name=TerriHendrix_WebsiteHome/>{{Better source needed|reason=This source is a video that might no longer be on Hendrix's website|date=October 2021}}

Maines has twice been inducted into the [[West Texas Walk of Fame]] — in 1993 as a member of the Maines Brothers Band and in 2012 in his own name.

'''Lonnie McIntosh''' (July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016), known as '''Lonnie Mack''', was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. He was influential in the development of [[blues rock]] music and [[rock music|rock]] [[guitar solo]]ing.

Mack emerged in 1963 with his breakthrough LP, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. It earned him lasting renown as both a [[blue-eyed soul]] singer<ref name="Davidson">{{Cite web |last=Davidson |first=Merric |date=2016-05-18 |title=Lonnie Mack |url=https://www.toppermost.co.uk/lonnie-mack/ |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Toppermost |language=en-US}}</ref> and a [[lead guitar]] innovator. The album's instrumental tracks included two hit singles, "Memphis" and "Wham". In them, Mack, using "top-quality technique" and "pristine" phrasing,<ref>{{Citation |title=British guitarist analyses Lonnie Mack and Stevie Ray Vaughan live in 1986! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaE2tN8dUx0 |access-date=2023-12-13 |language=en}}</ref> added "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" melodies and runs to the predominant chords-and-riffs pattern of early rock guitar.<ref name="auto">Hagood, "[https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ Lonnie Mack: Remembering His Trailblazing Blues-Rock Guitar Virtuosity]", Website:"Keeping the Blues Alive", April 29, 2016. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826121524/https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ |date=August 26, 2018 }}</ref> These tracks raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency,<ref>Interviewed for [[Duane Allman]]'s 2006 biography, guitarist Mike Johnstone recalled sixteen-year-old Allman's fascination with ''Memphis'', saying: "Now, at that time, there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.'"

Music historian [[Dick Shurman]], as quoted McCardle, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74]", Washington Post, April 25, 2016. Mack was a strong influence on several founders of Southern rock: (1) [[Allman Brothers]] lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]]: "People like Dickey Betts would tell you that without Lonnie they wouldn't be who they were. That goes for all of us." April 23, 2016, posting on Official Warren Haynes website, preserved at http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack; (2) Before finding fame as lead guitarist of the Allman Brothers, seventeen-year-old [[Duane Allman]] honed his soloing skills by playing ''Memphis'' along with Mack's record, repeatedly stopping and starting the record with his foot, until he had mastered Mack's technique. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, p. 10 ''et seq''.). (3) Remembering the unchallenging simplicity of early rock guitar, Allman Brothers co-lead guitarist, Dickey Betts, observed: "I was really gettin' tired of all the beach songs, and "Louie, Louie". Those are great songs, but I'm talkin' about ''guitar-playing''. And then, here come Lonnie Mack, right down the middle of it all. God, what a breath of fresh air that was for me." Betts video commentary at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij-LTAFB9o8; (4) Mack was a significant influence on two founders of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Steve Gaines]] and [[Ed King]]. Odom, ''Lynyrd Skynyrd: Remembering The Free Birds Of Southern Rock'', Broadway Books 2002, at p. 142. Before Gaines' rise to Skynyrd fame, he practiced "playing (''Memphis'') by ear until he could imitate" Mack, who was one of Gaines' "favorite artists". ''Id.'' Gaines can be heard singing and playing Mack's "Why" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAXU_-q3srs.</ref> that soon followed.

Shortly after the album's release, however, the [[British Invasion]] hit American shores, and Mack's recording career "withered on the vine".<ref>Puterbaugh, "[https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-british-invasion-from-the-beatles-to-the-stones-the-sixties-belonged-to-britain-244870/ The British Invasion: From the Beatles to the Stones, The Sixties Belonged to Britain]", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', July 14, 1988.

He was soon performing in major venues, but his multi-genre Elektra albums downplayed his lead guitar and blues rock appeal and record sales were modest. During this period, he became increasingly unhappy with the music business. He left Elektra in 1971, and for the next fourteen years he functioned as a low-profile multi-genre recording artist, roadhouse performer, sideman, and music-venue proprietor.

He continued to perform, mostly in small venues, until 2004.<ref name="auto1">See section below entitled "Career chronology".</ref>

== Early life and musical influences ==

Shortly before Mack's birth, his family moved from [[Appalachia]]n (eastern) [[Kentucky]] to [[Dearborn County]], [[Indiana]], on the banks of the Ohio River.<ref>During the migration of refugees from the coal mine closures in Southern Appalachia before World War II, most sought jobs in industrialized cities.  However, Mack's parents settled twenty miles downriver from Cincinnati, living and working on sharecropping farms.</ref> One of five children, he was born to parents Robert and Sarah Sizemore McIntosh on July 18, 1941, in [[West Harrison]], Indiana,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Mack, July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016|url=http://www.alligator.com/news/index.cfm/nid/689/t/Lonnie-Mack|website=Alligator.com}}</ref> near Cincinnati, Ohio. He was raised on a series of nearby [[sharecropping]] farms.

Using a floor-model radio powered by a truck battery, his family routinely listened to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' [[country music]] show. Continuing to listen after the rest of the family had retired for the night, Mack became a fan of [[rhythm and blues]] and [[traditional black gospel]] music.<ref>Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back of the Track", Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56.</ref>

He began playing guitar at the age of seven, after trading his bicycle for a [[Lone Ranger]] model acoustic guitar.<ref>(1) Forte, "Lonnie Mack: That Memphis Man is Back", 1978, p. 20; (2) Murrells, The Book of Golden Discs, Barrie & Jenkins, 1978, p.163</ref> His mother taught him basic chords,<ref name="Grimes" /> and he was soon playing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] guitar in the family band.<ref name="McArdle">{{Cite news |last=McArdle |first=Terence |date=2016-04-25 |title=Lonnie Mack, guitarist and singer who influenced blues and rock acts, dies at 74 |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html |access-date=2022-07-29 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Mack recalled that when he was "seven or eight years old" an uncle from Texas introduced him to [[blues]] guitar<ref name="merged1">{{cite AV media |date=March 13, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |title=Lonnie Mack Interview |publisher=John Broughton |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=October 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210105133502/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |archive-date=January 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> and that when he was about ten years of age, an "old black man" named Wayne Clark introduced him to "[[Robert Johnson]] style guitar". He soon taught himself to merge finger-picking country guitar with acoustic blues-picking, to produce a hybrid style which, Mack said, "sounded like [[rockabilly]], but before rockabilly".<ref>(1) Hear Mack interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYxmVf6Xik (2) Van Matre, "Lonnie Mack Back In The Swing Of Things", Chicago Tribune, May 2, 1985, at [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-05-0]{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 2/features/8501270055_1_mack-doesn-t-stevie-ray-vaughan-lonnie-mack. Chicago Tribune, Lifestyle Section. Retrieved July 11, 2014.</ref>

His musical influences remained diverse as he refined his playing and singing styles. In his pre-teen years, Mack was mentored by blind singer-guitarist Ralph Trotto, a [[country music|country]]-[[Gospel music|gospel]] performer.<ref name="liner notes to Memphis Wham!">(1) Bill Millar, liner notes to Ace (UK) early Mack compilation album entitled "Memphis Wham!".

== Career ==

Mack's career-long pattern of switching and mixing within the entire range of white and black Southern roots music genres<ref>His most popular albums, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963), ''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985), and ''Attack of the Killer V'' (1990) were blues-oriented with a rock instrumental bent and a [[traditional black gospel]] vocal bent.

In the early 1960s he became a [[session musicians|session guitarist]] with [[Fraternity Records]], a small Cincinnati label. In 1963, he recorded two hit singles for Fraternity, the proto-blues-rock guitar instrumentals "Memphis" and "Wham!". He soon recorded additional tunes to flesh out his debut album, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. Mack made some notable recordings later, particularly in the 1980s,<ref>''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985) and ''Lonnie Mack Live: Attack of the Killer V'' (1990), were commercially successful and drew critical acclaim.</ref> but his debut album (released October 1963) is widely considered the centerpiece of his career. It became a perennial critics' favorite:

*1968: Guitar: "...in a class by himself."...Vocals: "...sincerity and intensity that's hard to find anywhere."<ref>Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man",''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968</ref> – Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'', calling for re-issuance of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album.
*1987: "With so many trying to copy this same style, this album sounds surprisingly modern. Not many have done it this well, though."<ref>Himes, "Lonnie Mack", ''The Washington Post'', February 20, 1987</ref> – Gregory Himes, ''The Washington Post''
*1992: "The first of the guitar-hero records is also one of the best, and for perhaps the last time, the singing on such a disc is worthy of the guitar histrionics."<ref name="Guterman 1992, p. 34">Guterman, "The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time", Citadel Publishing, 1992, p. 34 (ranking the album No. 16).</ref> – Jimmy Guterman, ranking the album No. 16 in ''The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time''
*2007: "...a spectacular feast of down-home blues, gospel, R&B, and country chicken-pickin'...a unique vision of American roots music [that was] five years ahead of the British blues-rockers."<ref>Rubin, "Inside the Blues, 1942–1982", Hal Leonard, 2007, at page 124.</ref> – Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues, 1942–1982''
*2016: "Of all the Mack material available this is the one [album] I'd regard as absolutely essential."<ref name="Davidson" /> – Dave Stephens, ''Toppermost''

He recorded many additional sides for Fraternity between 1963 and 1967, but few, if any, were broadly released or strongly promoted, and none charted.<ref>Apart from "Memphis" (Billboard #5) and Wham!" (Billboard #24), only two additional Mack Fraternity singles charted: "Honky-Tonk '65" (#78) and "Baby, What's Wrong?" (#93).

"It looked like the guitar wizard was ready to bust out when the music world was turned on its ear. [In] February 1964, [[The Beatles]] appeared on the [[Ed Sullivan]] Show, and Mack's [recording] career withered on the vine."<ref>Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues: 1942–1982'', "Rockin' the Blues: Lonnie Mack & Michael Bloomfield", Hal Leonard (Updated Ed., 2007) at p. 124.</ref>

Although his recording career had stalled out, Mack stayed busy as a performer, criss-crossing the country with one-night stands. "The '60s, man, we was full of piss and vinegar, nothing bothered us. We had [[History and culture of substituted amphetamines#In music|bennies]], like the truckers had [and] we just stayed on the road all the time."<ref name="merged1" /> During that time, "[we] performed with just about everybody, [from] [[Jimi Hendrix]] [to] [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Dick and Dee Dee]]."<ref>McNutt, Guitar Towns, University of Indiana Press, 2002, at page 176.</ref> He also took on session work with [[James Brown]], [[Freddie King]], [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]], Albert Washington, and other R&B/soul artists.<ref>See, Mack discography at http://wdd.mbnet.fi/lonniemack.htm.

In 1968, at the height of the blues-rock era, [[Elektra Records]] bought out Mack's dormant Fraternity recording contract and moved him to Los Angeles to record three albums.<ref>Mack's three Elektra albums were ''[[Glad I'm in the Band]]'' (1969), ''[[Whatever's Right]]'' (1969), and ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'' (1971). These were eclectic collections of country and soul ballads, blues tunes, and updated versions of earlier recordings. Both 1969 albums emphasized Mack's vocals and de-emphasized his guitar work. They were modest commercial successes. Mack's final Elektra effort, ''The Hills of Indiana'', was a country album recorded in [[Nashville]] that attracted little attention.</ref> In November 1968, the newly founded ''Rolling Stone'' magazine published a rave review of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album, persuading Elektra to re-issue it.<ref>(a) Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968. (b) Elektra obliged, adding two bonus tracks from 1964 (''Farther On Down The Road'' and ''Chicken-Pickin''), under the title "For Collectors Only".</ref> He was soon performing in major rock venues, including the [[Fillmore East]], the [[Fillmore West]], and the [[Cow Palace]]. He opened for [[the Doors]]<ref>{{Citation |title=The Doors – Blues For Lonnie |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zpNnje-GRs |language=en |access-date=2022-07-29}}</ref> and [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] and shared the stage with [[Johnny Winter]], [[Elvin Bishop]] and other popular rock and blues artists of the time.<ref>(1) Deccio, "Lonnie Mack Dead", April 24, 2016, http://www.inquisitr.com/3029420/lonnie-mack-dead-guitarist-and-vocalist-who-pioneered-blues-rock-dies-at-74/; (2) Poster for Mack's six-day run at the Fillmore West in July 1969 at http://www.classicposters.com/Johnny_Winter/poster/Bill_Graham/180; (3) Poster of Mack's Cow Palace appearance with the Doors and Elvin Bishop at http://www.classicposters.com/Lonnie_Mack; (4) Mack's reference to appearing with C, S &N at the Fillmore East in his 1985 Carnegie Hall interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHAcMm8pxvo.</ref>

It was the [[hippie]] era, however, and Mack's rustic, blue-collar persona made for a rough fit with commercial rock's target demographic. John Morthland wrote: "[All] the superior chops in the world couldn't hide the fact that chubby, country Mack probably had more in common with Kentucky truck drivers than he did with the new rock audience."<ref>(1) Morthland, "Lonnie Mack", ''Output'', March 1984; (2) "Lonnie was a real country boy". Elektra producer Russ Miller, in Holzman, ''Follow the Music'', First Media, 1998, p. 367.</ref> In addition, after two multi-genre Elektra albums (both recorded in 1969) that downplayed his blues-rock strengths, including his guitar, Mack himself was dissatisfied: "My music wasn't working that good then. I ain’t really happy with a lot of the stuff I did there."<ref>Mack, as quoted in McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}.</ref>

At that point in his career, Mack took a break from performing and recording. According to [[Robbie Krieger]], lead guitarist of Elektra label-mate the Doors, Mack was seen during this period "selling Bibles out of the back of his car."<ref>Graff, Doors celebrate 50 years of "Morrison Hotel:" Q&A, The Oakland Press, Oct. 9, 2020, at https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/doors-celebrate-50-years-of-morrison-hotel-q-a/article_2a9bc814-0a4d-11eb-b11f-277180eb19ef.html</ref> He also worked for Elektra's A&R department, helping to recruit new talent.<ref>Upon completing his 1969 albums, Mack assumed a "[[Chet Atkins]]-[[Eric Clapton]] role at Elektra, doing studio dates, producing and A&R." (''Rolling Stone'', "Random Notes", February 7, 1970, p. 4,) In that role, he helped to recruit a number of country and blues artists from Nashville, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Elektra considered the launch of a specialty label to record them. (Holzman, ''Follow The Music'', First Media, 1998, pp. 366–67.) Mack was instrumental in signing [[Mickey Newbury]], but could not generate much interest in some other prospects, including [[Roberta Flack]]. (Houghton, ''Becoming Elektra'', 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246.) He then tried to sign [[Carole King]], but Elektra rejected her on the grounds that they already had [[Judy Collins]]. (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3.) Frustrated, he finally attempted to interest Elektra in gospel singer [[Dorothy Combs Morrison]], the former lead vocalist for the [[Edwin Hawkins Singers]] of "Oh Happy Day" fame. Mack had recorded Morrison singing a gospel-esque version of [[The Beatles]]' "Let It Be", and sought permission to release it; management's response was delayed, however, due to ongoing negotiations for the label's sale to Warner Brothers (Kot, Greg (December 13, 1989). "He Wrote The Book – tribunedigital-chicagotribune" (http://articles.chicagotribune.c{{dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} om/1989-12-13/features/8903170595_1_doors-morrison-hotel-memphis-man-lonnie-mack). Articles.chicagotribune.com. Retrieved August 18, 2015.), allowing a competing label to seize the initiative and release [[Aretha Franklin]]'s own gospel version first. "That bummed me out" (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3), Mack said. According to a close associate, Mack "had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business". (Hear, interview of Stuart Holman (Mack's bass-player in the early '70s), "Lonnie Mack Special", July 16, 2011, at
http://wvxu.org/post/lonnie-mack-special#stream/0.) Finally, Mack resigned from his A&R job. (Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back on the Track", ''Guitar World'', May 1984, pp. 59–60.)</ref> In 1971, with one album left to complete his contract with Elektra, Mack moved to [[Nashville]]. There, he recorded ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'', a multi-genre (but country-flavored) LP with a vocal emphasis.<ref name="Davidson" /> It included only one track showcasing his guitar virtuosity, "Asphalt Outlaw Hero". ''The Hills of Indiana'' attracted little attention.

Mack had begun missing the fun of small-town performance venues early in his time with Elektra<ref>Mary Campbell, "Blues Guitarist Mack Is Back", Terre Haute Tribune-Star, November 2, 1969, p. 66.</ref> and soon soured on the fantasy of rock celebrity status. "[It had] a lot to do with how much value you put on money as opposed to what makes you happy. I wasn't happy. So one of the best-feeling moments I ever had was when that L.A. sign was in my rear-view mirror and I was free again."<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train.&pg=PA73 Mack's departure from the LA rock scene apparently also involved a threatening premonition. Towards the end of Mack's time at Elektra, the label had put together a musical whistle-stop touring group, including Mack, Don Nix, and others, billed as "The Alabama State Troupers and Mount Zion Choir". (Holzman, Follow The Music, First Media, 2000, p. 36.) According to Elektra producer Russ Miller, Mack disappeared six days before the tour was to begin. Miller found him hiding out on his rustic Kentucky farm. Mack refused to join the tour, citing a nightmare during his last night in Los Angeles, in which he and his family had been pursued by Satan. He had awakened in a sweat, finding his Bible opened to a passage warning him to "flee from Mount Zion". Miller, a former evangelist preacher (Houghton, Becoming Elektra, 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246), knew Mack's mind. Returning to California alone, Miller explained: "[Lonnie's] a real country boy. [T]hat was it for Lonnie". (Holzman, ''supra''). Mack wrote a tune relating to this experience. In "A Song I Haven't Sung" (1986), he equated the pursuit of "fortune and fame" with selling one's soul to Satan, allowing the "body to live while your soul is left to rot". The tune appears on Mack's 1986 Alligator album, "Second Sight".</ref> On another occasion, Mack said: "Seems like every time I get close to really making it, to climbing to the top of the mountain, that's when I pull out. I just pull up and run."<ref>Mack, as quoted in Guralnick, Pickers, "Lonnie Mack: Fiery Picker Goes Country", 1977, pp. 16–18.</ref> Upon Mack's death in 2016, music historian [[Dick Shurman]] observed that Mack's temperament "wasn't suited to stardom. I think he'd rather have been hunting and fishing. He didn't like cities or the (music) business."<ref>(1) Dick Shurman, as quoted in McArdle, "Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74", [[Washington Post]] April 25, 2016, at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html.1]{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}). (2) Shurman's observation about Mack's dislike of cities finds support in the lyrics of two Mack tunes: (a) "L.A. made me sick." (''A Long Way From Memphis'', 1985); (b) (''Country'', 1976). (3) Shurman's observation about Mack's dislike of the music business was echoed by Stuart Holman, Mack's bass guitarist in the early 1970s: "Lonnie had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business."

In 1971, with his Elektra contract completed, Mack went home to southern Indiana, where, for more than a decade, he was a roadhouse performer, [[sideman]], and low-profile country/bluegrass recording artist.<ref>{{Citation |title=Hey Dixie by Dobie Gray – RYM/Sonemic |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/dobie-gray/hey-dixie/ |language=en |access-date=2022-07-29}}</ref> During this period, he also owned and operated a nightclub in Covington, Kentucky, and an outdoor country music venue in Friendship, Indiana.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lonnie Mack – April 21, 2016 – Obituary – Tributes.com |url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/print_selections/103505970?type=6 |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=www.tributes.com}}</ref>

In 1977, Mack was shot during an altercation with an off-duty police officer. The experience inspired Mack's tune, "Cincinnati Jail", a rowdy, guitar-and-vocal rock number that he favored in live performances later in his career.

In 1983, Mack relocated to [[Austin, Texas]], for a collaboration with his blues-rock disciple, guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].<ref>(1) Mack, as quoted in Gettleman, "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack Is A Low-Key Yet Major Influence On Many Musicians", Orlando Sentinel, as reproduced in Desert News/The Salt Lake Tribune, Tues. PM/Wed. AM, August 3–4, 1993 at p.3. (2) Vaughan idolized Mack, calling him "the baddest guitar player I know" (Vaughan, as heard on DVD entitled "American Caravan: Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble", recorded in 1986
at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis. It can be seen and heard ''here'': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkBqTWBIkKw.) and credited much of his own guitar style to Mack. ("Lonnie invented a lot of this stuff." Newton, "My First Interview With Stevie Ray Vaughan", at https://earofnewt.com/2015/08/26/my-first-interview- with-stevie-ray-vaughan-when-he-sang-me-three-lines-of-an-earl-king-song/.) Vaughan also said, "I got a lot of the fast things I do from Lonnie" (Menn, Secrets From The Masters, Miller-Freeman, Inc, 1992, p. 278, {{ISBN|0-87930-260-7}}). Three years before his death, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. (Vaughan interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcrkPrxj698). As a teen-ager, Vaughan honed his guitar skills by playing along with ''Wham!'', starting and stopping the record-player repeatedly as he attempted to copy Mack's guitar. (Vaughan interview, https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=GImi3eGVbSI, at counter 17:36; Patoski, "SRV: Caught in the Crossfire", 1993, Backbeat: 15–16.) In his teens, [[Duane Allman]] did the same with ''Memphis''. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10 ''et seq''.) Vaughan went on to record ''Wham!'' several times, and called his own instrumental, ''Scuttle-Buttin'', "just another way of playin' [Mack's 1964 instrumental] ''Chicken-Pickin''." (Vaughan, as quoted in review of the album ''Couldn't Stand The Weather'' at http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/stevie-ray-vaughan-couldnt-stand-the-weather-legacy-edition-album-review-265255.

Mack's early guitar recordings remain closely identified with the dawn of virtuoso blues-rock guitar.<ref name=talkinblues>See, e.g., (1) {{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/talkin-blues-lonnie-mack-and-birth-blues-rock |title=Talkin' Blues: Lonnie Mack and the Birth of Blues-Rock |magazine=[[Guitar World]]|access-date=May 18, 2014}}; (2) Guitar Player, "101 Forgotten Greats and Unsung Heroes", January 2, 2007, at https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/101-forgotten-greats-andamp-unsung-heroes; and (3) Brown & Newquist, ''Legends of Rock Guitar'', "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997 at p.25. (4) They were not his only early demonstrations of soloing skill, however. ''Suzie Q'' (1963) and ''Lonnie on the Move'' (1964) are often mentioned, but the former was not promoted as a single and the latter was lost in the tidal wave of the [[British Invasion]]. A third, ''Chicken-Pickin'' (1964), widely considered Mack's greatest early demonstration of fret-board speed, suffered a similar fate. More recently, Jeff Beck regularly performed ''Lonnie on the Move'' during his 2015 and 2016 tours.  It is a direct copy of Mack's own live, 1990 version. Beck probably first heard the tune when it was issued in Britain on the Stateside label in 1964.

Mack enhanced his guitar sound with [[vibrato]] effects. In his early recordings, he used a 1950s-era [[Magnatone]] amplifier to produce a constant, electronically generated, watery-sounding vibrato,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marcusohara@aol.com |date=2016-04-23 |title=The Unique Guitar Blog: Lonnie Mack – Dead at age 74 – Rock's First Guitar Heroes |url=https://uniqueguitar.blogspot.com/2016/04/lonnie-mack-dead-at-age-74-rocks-first.html |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=The Unique Guitar Blog}}</ref> in the style of R&B guitarist [[Robert Ward (blues musician)|Robert Ward]].<ref name="Davidson" /> Throughout his career, he also used a manually-operated Bigsby [[vibrato arm]] to bend the pitch selectively.

While some of Mack's signature performance elements had appeared in early rock saxophone and keyboard solos, a seamless combination of all was essentially unheard in rock guitar before Mack.<ref>(1) "Before Lonnie, the horn guys did all the lead work. He made the guitar the pre-eminent lead instrument". Former Elektra executive James Webber, in Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train%3B&pg=PA73 See also, Sandmel, Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56. (2) Mack's lead guitar style did not go mainstream overnight. As late as November 1968, a ''Rolling Stone'' reviewer found his use of bluegrass-style runs in his solos "peculiar". Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man!", Rolling Stone, November 23, 1968.</ref> Rock historian Dave Stephens rates Mack's overall guitar sound "highly distinctive, dare I say, unique; in the early rock era only Link Wray and Duane Eddy could match him for instant recognition."<ref name="Davidson" />

== Mack's role in the evolution of rock lead guitar ==

Although notable commercial success was periodic and fleeting, Mack's early-1960s recordings became rock guitar trendsetters. They raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency, helped propel the electric guitar to the top of soloing instruments in rock, and served as prototypes for the genres of blues rock and Southern rock.

Interviewed for a biography of Southern Rock guitar legend [[Duane Allman]], guitarist and early Allman associate Mike Johnstone recalled the professional impact of Mack's rock guitar proficiency when he and Allman were starting out:<ref>Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10.</ref>

{{blockquote | Now, [in 1963], there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.' }}

Another player of that era observed: "Lonnie Mack made the other guitar-slingers of the day – [[Duane Eddy]], [[Dick Dale]], [[the Ventures]] – sound tame by comparison. Only [[Travis Wammack]] and [[Link Wray]] came close."<ref>Windham, "REVIEW: Lonnie Mack made other guitarists in his day sound tame by comparison", Tuscaloosa News, 11/13/2003, preserved on-line at https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/story/news/2003/11/14/review-lonnie-mack-made-other-guitarists-in-his-day-sound-tame-by-comparison/27851967007/</ref>

Mack's "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" blues guitar sound is also credited with a key role in the electric guitar's rise to the top of soloing instruments in rock. Blues critic Shawn Hagood wrote:<ref name="auto" />

{{blockquote | His playing was faster, louder, more aggressive than anything people were used to hearing. He essentially paved the way for the electric guitar to become a soloing instrument in rock music. A true blues-rock pioneer, the genre would not have been the same – indeed, much of rock music might not have been the same – without his innovative way of treating the electric guitar as a lead soloing instrument in rock – edgy, aggressive, loud and fast. }}

Former Elektra [[A&R]] executive James Webber agrees:<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&dq=schaber+mule+train&pg=PA73</ref>

{{blockquote | Lonnie took rock guitar playing to a whole different level. You had to really play now. [B]efore Lonnie, the sax guys did all of the lead work. He made the guitar the preeminent lead instrument. }}

Mack's early-1960s guitar tracks are said to have set the stage for blues-rock guitar and Southern rock guitar, styles that first enjoyed broad popularity a few years later. From ''Legends of Rock Guitar'' (1997):<ref>Brown & Newquist, Legends of Rock Guitar, "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997, p. 24.</ref>

{{blockquote | [Mack] is essentially the missing guitar link between the twangy, multi-string riffing of rockabilly and the bluesy, string-pushing players of the mid-sixties. He also made the crucial bridge between the black blues and white hillbilly music via his lead work...In all, it is not an exaggeration to say that Lonnie Mack was well ahead of his time in 1963. His bluesy solos predated the pioneering blues-rock guitar work of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and Mike Bloomfield by nearly two years. [Since] ''they'' are considered "before their time", the chronological significance of Lonnie Mack for the world of rock guitar is that much more remarkable. }}

Southern rock ([[Allman Brothers]]) lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] expressed a similar assessment:<ref name="Warren Haynes">{{cite web|url=http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack|title=Warren Haynes – news|website=Warrenhaynes.net|access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>

{{blockquote | Guitar players, true musicians, and real music fans realize that Lonnie was the Jimi Hendrix of his time. Between the era of Chuck Berry and the era of Hendrix there were a handful of guitar players like Lonnie Mack who were making ground-breaking music that paved the way for the [lead guitar] Revolution. People like Dickey Betts and Stevie Ray Vaughan would tell you that without Lonnie they wouldn't be who they were. That goes for all of us. }}

Mack's 1963 debut album has been called "the first of the ''guitar hero'' records"<ref name="Guterman 1992, p. 34" /> for its introduction of flashy, technically challenging melodies and runs to rock [[guitar solo]]s.

== Mack's 1958 Gibson Flying V Guitar, "Number 7" ==
Mack was closely identified with the distinctive-looking [[Gibson Flying V]] guitar that first appeared in 1958. When he was seventeen, he bought the seventh Flying V off the first-year production line, naming it "Number 7".
Mack was viscerally attracted to the arrow-like shape of the guitar.<ref name="gibson.com">McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}</ref> Mack played "Number 7" almost exclusively throughout his career.<ref>McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson online at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}, May 9, 2007.</ref> The title of Mack's final album, ''Attack of the Killer V'', was a reference to his guitar.

Early in his career, Mack added a Bigsby vibrato bar to the guitar. It required mounting a steel crossbeam approximately six inches below the apex of the "V", giving the guitar a unique appearance. Mack favored thick (heavy) strings, i.e., .010, .012, .018w, .028, .038, .052. He typically only bent the first (higher) two, and used a wound string only for the third. He said that the wound third string was important to his sound.<ref>Russ House, Reverb.com, "Celebrity Owned Gibson Flying V" (detailed specifications of No. 7 and its Mack-approved replicas), 2017 (no month or day shown), at https://reverb.com/item/15750071-celebrity-owned-gibson-flying-v-personal-run-for-lonnie-mack</ref>

In 1993, Gibson Guitar Corporation issued a limited-run "Lonnie Mack Signature Edition" of Number 7.<ref name="Meiners, Larry p. 13">Meiners, Larry 2001-03-01, Flying V: The Illustrated History of the Modernistic Guitar, Flying Vintage Publishing, p. 13.</ref> In 2010, it was featured in ''Star Guitars: 101 Guitars That Rocked The World''.<ref>Hunter, ''Star Guitars: 101 Guitars That Rocked The World'', "Lonnie Mack: 1958 Flying V", Voyageur Press 2010, at pp. 152, ''et seq''.</ref> In 2011, Walter Carter, author of ''The Guitar Collection'', named Number 7 one of the world's "150 most elite guitars".<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Guitar Collection |url=https://uncrate.com/the-guitar-collection/ |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=uncrate.com |language=en}}</ref> In 2012, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine named it one of "20 iconic guitars".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Sullivan |first1=James |date=2019-11-16 |title=20 Iconic Guitars |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-iconic-guitars-18021/ |access-date=2022-07-29 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>

== "Blue-eyed soul" vocals ==

Throughout his career, Mack's vocals blended white and black Southern roots influences. One commentator dubbed his singing style "country-esque blues".<ref>Watrous, "Lonnie Mack in a Melange of Guitar Styles", New York Times, September 18, 1988. See also, Davis, ''The History of the Blues'', Da Capo Press, 1995, at p. 246, describing Mack's vocals as those of "a white Hoosier with a touch of black Memphis in his soul."</ref> His best-known vocals were gospel-inspired "blue-eyed soul" ballads. Most failed to chart,<ref>(1) "Baby, What's Wrong?" hit the low end of the charts at 93 in December 1963. See, Billboard's "Chart History" list for Mack at http://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719031335/https://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart |date=July 19, 2018 }}. (2) The blue-eyed soul vocals on Mack's debut album, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963) came at a time when the racial divide in American culture was epitomized by the difference between black and white pop music styles. (Kirkus Review of the book, ''Country Soul'', by Charles L. Hughes, U. of North Carolina Press, 2015, at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-i-hughes/country-soul/). When Mack's first vocal recordings were released in 1963, Mack's gospel-inspired version of the soul ballad "Where There's a Will" was played on R&B radio stations throughout the Deep South. Soon, he was invited to give a live radio interview with a prominent R&B disc jockey in racially polarized Birmingham, Alabama. Mack said that when he appeared at the
radio station, the DJ said, "Baby, you're the wrong color" and canceled the interview on the spot. After that, Mack's vocals received little play on R&B radio stations.

*1983: "Ultimately—for consistency and depth of feeling—the best blue-eyed soul is defined by Lonnie Mack's ballads and virtually everything The Righteous Brothers recorded. Lonnie Mack wailed a soul ballad as gutsily as any black gospel singer.

{{blockquote | He made a couple of adjustments and then proceeded to begin OFFICIALLY TEARING THE ROOF OFF THE PLACE. He peeled the paint off the walls with my rig. His (my?) guitar was smoking. Sounded like the breathing of a very large, wild animal. His band leading skills were also awesome. Lots of pointing at people to change dynamics and cue solos. He owned the stage and had everybody doing exactly what he wanted them to do. Crowd went nuts, people were taking pics with their camera phones. People were screaming, everybody started dancing, it was great. He cut my other lead player's head clean off when they were swapping licks, [which] was pretty funny, as [my other lead player] is a big [[Eddie Van Halen]]-style flash player.

'''Lynn René Anderson''' (September 26, 1947 – July 30, 2015) was an American [[country music|country]] singer and television personality. Her  [[crossover (music)|crossover]] [[list of signature songs|signature recording]], "[[Rose Garden (song)|Rose Garden]]," was a number one hit internationally.  She also charted five number one and 18 top-ten singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart.  Anderson is regarded as one of country music's most significant performers.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|2003|p=337-39}}<ref name="RS 100">{{cite magazine |last1=Johnston |first1=Maura |author-link=Maura Johnston |title=100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time (Lynn Anderson) |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-country-artists-of-all-time-195775/lynn-anderson-2-196673/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 15, 2017 |access-date=June 25, 2020}}</ref>

Born in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]], United States, she was raised in California by her mother, [[Liz Anderson]], who was also a country music artist. Daughter Lynn was signed to a recording contract to [[Chart Records]] in 1966 after she was heard singing along with her mother at an industry function. Previously she had recorded some demo tapes of her mother's songs and appeared on television in California on regional country music shows. In 1967, she had her first top ten hit with the single "[[If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away)]]". Soon after, Anderson joined the cast of ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', where she performed country music weekly to a national audience.

In 1970, Anderson signed with [[Columbia Records]], where she was produced by her first husband, [[Glenn Sutton]]. She had her biggest commercial success with "Rose Garden". The song reached positions on the ''Billboard'' country, pop, and adult contemporary charts, also charting in other countries and earning her a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]. Throughout the decade, Anderson also had number-one hits with "[[You're My Man]]", "[[How Can I Unlove You]]", "[[Keep Me in Mind (Lynn Anderson song)|Keep Me in Mind]]", and "[[What a Man My Man Is]]". She also became a television personality, with appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', specials with [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dean Martin]], and her own prime-time specials.

After a brief hiatus, Anderson returned with the studio album ''[[Back (Lynn Anderson album)|Back]]'' (1983). The album spawned three singles, including the top ten hit "[[You're Welcome to Tonight]]", with [[Gary Morris]]. She continued recording sporadically throughout the 1980s. This included a revival of the pop hit "[[Under the Boardwalk]]" and the studio album ''[[What She Does Best]]'' (1988). Anderson continued releasing new albums into the new millennium, such as 2004's ''[[The Bluegrass Sessions (Lynn Anderson album)|The Bluegrass Sessions]]''. Towards the end of her life, Anderson struggled with alcohol addiction, but continued performing until her death in 2015. For her work as a crossover artist, she was ranked on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of the "100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time" and ''[[Country Music Television|CMT]]''s "40 Greatest Women of Country Music".

==Early life==
Lynn Rene Anderson was born in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]], on September 26, 1947, to Casey and [[Liz Anderson]].<ref name="Billboard Obituary">{{cite magazine |last1=Dauphin |first1=Chuck |title=Lynn Anderson, Country Star Behind 'Rose Garden,' Dies at 67 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/obituary/6649400/lynn-anderson-country-star-rose-garden-dead |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=July 31, 2015 |access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref> Her grandparents were Scandinavian immigrants who established a North Dakota "saddle club". According to Anderson, she could ride horses before she could walk.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=176}} While she was still a young child, the family relocated to a subdivision in [[Fair Oaks, California]].{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}}<ref name="Billboard Obituary"/> 

However, Anderson insisted that her parents move to a [[ranch]], prompting the family to move to [[Sacramento, California]]. In Sacramento, the Anderson family bought a ranch with two acres of land. The family raised horses, which she learned how to ride and care for. At the age of 9, Anderson won second place at a local horse-racing event in [[San Francisco, California]].{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=176}} Lynn also became interested in performing from an early age. Both her parents were aspiring songwriters that had formed friendships with west country performers.{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}}<ref name="Billboard Bridges">{{cite magazine |last1=Dauphin |first1=Chuck |title=Lynn Anderson Talks 'Bridges' Album: 'You Never Know Where Your Next Deal Might Come From' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6613167/lynn-anderson-bridges-album-interview |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=June 30, 2015 |access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref> Her performing and musical interests continued into [[high school]].

While working full-time, Lynn continued entering equestrian competitions. Once winning several competitions, she was dubbed the "California Horse Show Queen" in 1966.<ref name="Billboard Obituary"/>{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} While watching her daughter at these events, Liz Anderson was also composing songs. She sent her compositions to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they were heard by music executives.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=176}} Among the songs heard was "[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]", which was recorded by [[Merle Haggard]] in 1964.{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} The song led producer [[Chet Atkins]] to sign Liz to a recording contract at RCA Victor. This prompted the family to relocate to Nashville.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=176}} Before officially moving, Liz took a brief trip with her daughter to Nashville in 1965. At a hotel, mother and daughter performed in an informal sing-along with several other artists. Also present at the sing-along was producer [[Slim Williamson]]. Impressed by her vocals, Williamson offered Lynn a recording contract of her own.{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} In 1966, she signed her first recording contract with [[Chart Records]].<ref name="Billboard Obituary"/>

==Music career==
===1966–1969: Early country success and ''The Lawrence Welk Show''===
During a car ride, Liz Anderson composed a song titled "Ride, Ride, Ride". Her daughter liked the song and had an interest in cutting it at her new label. It was cut at her first recording session.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=176-77}} Although her debut single was 1966's "In Person",<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> it was "[[Ride, Ride, Ride (song)|Ride, Ride, Ride]]" that became Anderson's first charting single.{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} Her next release was another Liz Anderson composition, "[[If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away)]]".<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> It was Anderson's first major hit as a music artist, reaching number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1967.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="If I Kiss You (Will Go Away)" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/lynn-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> Her [[Ride, Ride, Ride|debut studio album of the same name]] was also released in 1967 and peaked at number 25 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Ride, Ride, Ride'' [album] chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/lynn-anderson/chart-history/clp/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> She followed it with "[[Promises, Promises (Lynn Anderson song)|Promises, Promises]]", which reached number four on the country singles list in February 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Promises, Promises" chart history [single] |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/lynn-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> Her [[Promises, Promises (Lynn Anderson album)|second studio release of the same name]] reached number one on the country albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=''Promises, Promises'' chart history [album] |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/lynn-anderson/chart-history/clp/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref>

When reviewing her 1999 Chart compilation, Greg Adams of [[AllMusic]] gave the recording four-and-a-half out of five stars. "Lynn Anderson made some of the best music of her career during her late-'60s period on the Chart label", Adams commented.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Anthology: The Chart Years'': Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/anthology-the-chart-years-mw0000251721 |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> ''Billboard'' magazine also praised these early recordings. In reviewing ''Big Girls Don't Cry'', writers took note of her mass appeal.

In 1967, Anderson's career gained further momentum when she was cast on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]''.{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} Welk's son, Larry Welk, discovered an Anderson album cover and was drawn to her physicality. Larry's interest drew Lawrence Welk to audition and eventually cast her.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=177}} Anderson became the show's first country performer and toured with the cast nationwide.{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} However, she was dissatisfied with the material chosen for her to sing on the program and threatened to quit. After meeting with Welk, different arrangements were made for Anderson's performances.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=177}} The exposure led to continued music success. In 1967, she won the "Top Female Vocalist" award at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]].<ref name="ACM Awards">{{cite web |title=Academy of Country Music: ACM Winners (Lynn Anderson) |url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners |website=[[Academy of Country Music]] |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> She remained with ''The Lawrence Welk Show'' until 1968.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=177}}

While finding chart success and common ground with Welk, Anderson was not finding common ground with the Nashville establishment. "I was seen as a kid from California on the Welk show – not a real country artist", she stated. Thus, she chose to record more traditional material that would help associate her with Nashville's country music scene. Among these songs was a cover of the [[Osborne Brothers]]' "[[Rocky Top]]".{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=177}} Anderson's version became a bigger hit than the original, climbing to number 17 on the ''Billboard'' country singles list in 1970.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Rocky Top" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/lynn-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> She had country hits between 1968 and 1969 that further displayed a traditional country style, including "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (Lynn Anderson song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]", "[[That's a No No]]" and a cover of [[Hank Snow]]'s "[[I've Been Everywhere]]".{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} Anderson's sixth studio album was a tribute to the traditional female country performers that preceded her.

[[file:Lynn Anderson--Billboard 1971.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anderson in ''Billboard'' magazine, 1971]]
In 1970, Anderson's recording contract was bought by [[Columbia Records]] and she began recording for the new label that year. Two years prior, she married songwriter and producer [[Glenn Sutton]], who ultimately became her producer at the label. Her first Columbia release was the Sutton-penned "[[Stay There, Till I Get There]]".{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=178}} The song became her fifth top ten hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart, rising to number seven in 1970.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Stay There, Till I Get There" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/lynn-anderson/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref> Her eighth studio album of the same name was also released in 1970. According to writer Greg Adams, the album resembled the traditional country of her previous Chart recordings.{{sfn|Adams, Greg|2005|p=1}} Despite the success of Sutton's composition, Anderson claimed that it was hard for Sutton to provide additional material for her. His collaborator, [[Billy Sherrill]], oversaw Sutton and chose many of his compositions for [[Tammy Wynette]] to record. "Glen was very politically connected at Columbia and Epic...so I had to find songs from other sources, which is why a lot of my songs were written by other people", she commented in 2011.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2011|p=178}}

'''Martha Elenor Maguire''' (née '''Erwin''', previously '''Seidel'''; October 12, 1969) is an American musician who is a founding member of the country band [[the Chicks]] and the country bluegrass duo [[Court Yard Hounds]]. She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Maguire is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.

Maguire learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, [[Emily Strayer]] (born Emily Erwin) and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]] and Robin Lynn Macy, forming a bluegrass and country music band, [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer [[Natalie Maines]], the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with 19 singles hitting the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Charts]], 2 Diamond Albums, 2 Platinum albums, and 13 [[Grammy Awards]].  Maguire subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in a 2003 controversy for [[Dixie Chicks controversy|criticizing George W. Bush]], which led to the Chicks being [[blacklisted]] by many country radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |title=Chicks in the Line of Fire |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1196419,00.html |access-date=October 5, 2022 |publisher=Time Magazine |date=May 21, 2006}}</ref>

Encouraged by her parents &ndash; educators at private schools &ndash; Maguire began playing violin at age five, and by age 12, started to learn to play "[[fiddle]] style" after receiving a birthday gift of fiddle lessons.<ref name="Ladies Home Journal">[http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/martiemaguirecelebprofile_01132003.xml]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> She also was active in her school orchestra.<ref name="Gilchriest">[http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219045902/http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm|date=December 19, 2007}}</ref>

Her sister Emily shared her love and interest in music, and displayed early talent herself. The two sisters were provided musical instruction on several instruments, and their talent for [[vocal harmony]] continued to be nurtured. Although Maguire became famous for her harmony and mastery of the fiddle, she also plays a variety of [[String instrument|strings]] that include the [[viola]], guitar, [[mandolin]], and double bass.<ref name=Leggett>Leggett, Steve [https://archive.today/20130104003115/http://music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16649328&menu=bio All-Music Guide writer on MSN] (Retrieved March 9, 2008)</ref> Maguire [[Composer|compose]]s songs and [[arrangement|arrange]]s the use of [[stringed instrument]]s for concert and recording performances.

Upon graduation from high school, with Emily still in high school, she spent a year attending college at [[Southwestern University]] in [[Georgetown, Texas]], from 1988 to 1989.

==The Chicks==
[[File:Martie Maguire by ViVr.jpg|thumb|left| Maguire at [[Royal Albert Hall]], 2003]]
In 1989, Maguire and Strayer joined guitarist Robin Lynn Macy and [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]] on double bass in the [[Dixie Chicks]], playing what was at the time predominantly [[bluegrass music]] and a mix of [[Country music|country]] standards. Originally listed as Martha, and then Martie Erwin, Maguire played [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[viola]] and [[Harmony|harmonized]] with Strayer on backing vocals.<ref name="Superior">{{cite web |url=http://www.superiorpics.com/martie_maguire/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203175101/http://www.superiorpics.com/martie_maguire/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |title=The Martie Maguire Picture Pages |publisher=Superiorpics.com |access-date=2014-07-15 }}</ref>

Maguire had begun writing and recording songs on their debut independent album, ''[[Thank Heavens for Dale Evans]]'', and in 2001, one song co-written with Laura Lynch called "Pink Toenails" resurfaced. The song was featured in the film, ''[[Don't Say A Word]]'', with [[Skye McCole Bartusiak]] performing the song.<ref name="Yahoo review">(Retrieved March 22, 2008)[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1807438736/cast#Music Yahoo Movie Review for Don't Say a Word] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522135843/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1807438736/cast#Music |date=May 22, 2011 }}</ref>

When their second album had a more polished sound, Maguire commented, "I hope our fans won't be disappointed [in ''The Little Ol' Cowgirl'']; it's got drums on every track; it's no longer bluegrass, but we have to make a living and you can't do that playing bluegrass."<ref name="Clark">Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time?

Two albums later, after [[Natalie Maines]] became the lead vocalist of the Chicks, the band's commercial success skyrocketed. Maguire said of their music, "It's very rootsy, but then Natalie comes in with a rock and blues influence. That gave Emily and I{{sic}} a chance to branch out, because we loved those kinds of music but felt limited by our instruments."<ref name="Malkin">{{cite web|url=http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html |title=Martie Maguire |publisher=Chickoholic.tripod.com |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref>

[[File:Martie Maguire in Austin, Texas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Martie Maguire with the Dixie Chicks in Austin, TX, 2006]]
Maguire co-wrote the song, "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]" on the Chicks' album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' for her sister Emily. It was a tribute to Emily's [[courtship]] with [[country music]] writer/singer [[Charlie Robison]].<ref name="Ladies Home Journal" /> Maguire was singled out by [[Broadcast Music, Incorporated|BMI]] in 2000, and awarded Songwriter of the Year for writing and/or co-writing "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]", "Ready To Run" and "[[You Were Mine]]". "You Were Mine" was co-written by the sisters about their parents' divorce.<ref name="Hillman">Hillman, Chris [https://ew.com/article/1999/09/23/dixie-chicks-burn-billboard-pop-charts/ Entertainment Weekly]   (Retrieved April 21, 2008)</ref>

In 1999, the Dixie Chicks performed two songs, recording a [[Cover song|cover]] of the song, "[[You Can't Hurry Love]]" as well as Maguire's "[[Ready to Run (Dixie Chicks song)|Ready to Run]]" for the [[Julia Roberts]]/ [[Richard Gere]] film ''[[Runaway Bride (1999 film)|Runaway Bride]]''. In 2003, Maguire was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for co-composing the [[film score]] to ''[[Urban Cowboy (musical)|Urban Cowboy]]''; the musical used her "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]".<ref name="Frontpage Publicity">[http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/careeroverview.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226165207/http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/careeroverview.html|date=February 26, 2008}}</ref>

After the band achieved massive commercial success with its first two [[Sony Music|Sony]] studio albums with Maines, they struggled with their record company over artistic direction on the third. Maguire commented, "I don't think any of us ever trusted Nashville. When you're in that town you know everybody is talking about everybody else. Everybody is wishing for the other guy to fail."<ref name="Flippo">Martie Maguire, to ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 5/21/06. Flippo, Chet (May 25, 2006) [http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1532532/nashville-skyline-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks.jhtml  CMT News Nashville Skyline: Dixie Chicks, Dixie Chicks, Dixie Chicks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407062651/http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1532532/nashville-skyline-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks.jhtml |date=April 7, 2014 }}</ref>

Although Maguire and Strayer often appear quiet and demure compared to their animated bandmate Natalie Maines, the trio have stood united on controversial subjects since they banded together to play in 1995, even when their opinions have had the potential to serve them more harm than good. In 2006, Maguire said, "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Toby Keith]]. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |title=Chicks in the Line of Fire |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1196419,00.html |magazine=Time |date=May 21, 2006 |publisher=Time Magazine |access-date=October 5, 2022}}</ref>

With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, Maguire was working on a solo fiddle album; however, it was announced in January 2010 that she and sister [[Emily Strayer]] have formed a side project called the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], with Strayer on lead vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dixiechickshenhouse.com/ |title=Dixie Chicks Henhouse |publisher=Dixiechickshenhouse.com|access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=2485 |title=Dixie Chicks Martie Maguire records |publisher=Countrystandardtime.com |date=2007-10-23 |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref> The band made their live debut in March at [[South by Southwest]] with an album released in May 2010.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/01/15/dixie-chicks-plan-album-tour-with-court-yard-hounds-side-project/ |title=Which Band Will Reunite Next?

==Personal life==
Maguire married [[pharmaceutical]] [[sales representative|representative]] Ted Seidel on June 17, 1995, and changed her last name to Seidel. She also was stepmother to his son, Carter.

At bandmate [[Natalie Maines]]' sister Kim's wedding, Martie met Gareth Maguire, a [[Roman Catholic]] teacher and actor from [[Carnlough]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The couple became engaged in June 2001 and married on August 10, 2001, in a civil ceremony in Hawaii; as explained at one of their concerts, the Dixie Chicks' song "[[White Trash Wedding]]" is based on Martie's relationship with Gareth.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/EshGQDYBKyE Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150110122700/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EshGQDYBKyE Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EshGQDYBKyE |title=An evening with The Dixie Chicks - White Trash Wedding |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-11-25 |access-date=2014-07-15}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Later they had a Catholic "blessing" ceremony in the groom's hometown, [[Carnlough]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]], on March 9, 2002, for all the guests that were not able to attend the first wedding.

Maguire has been frank about using [[in vitro fertilization]] to conceive their daughters. In an interview in ''[[Conceive (magazine)|Conceive]]'', she said, "All my paperwork said 'unspecified origin.'  We spent three years of active trying before we went to IVF. First I went on [[Clomid]]. Then I had some dye tests and found I had a collapsed tube, so I had [[laparoscopic surgery]]; the tube wasn't blocked, just spasming."

In 2008, regarding the number of children the Dixie Chicks had produced in the past seven years, (Maines had two; Strayer had four in addition to Maguire's twins and newborn) Maguire told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' "We'll have to move over and let the little chicks take over! We've got a new band!"<ref name="People">''People Magazine'' (accessed January 28, 2008) [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20174066,00.html  Dixie Chick Martie Maguire Is Expecting]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914183801/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20174066%2C00.html |date=September 14, 2016 }}</ref>

Maguire and Strayer co-wrote a song, "So Hard", about their own personal experiences with infertility and their need to rely on other methods to conceive. They speak out about the difficulties they faced, but also their good fortune; both having options that for many women are financially prohibitive. Mentioning the [[social stigma|stigma]] attached to IVF, Maguire said, "I think we feel a responsibility to break down some barriers. It's much more of a common problem than people realize."<ref name="FrontpagePublicity">Frontpage Publicity [http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/bio.html  Dixie Chicks Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017015925/http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/bio.html |date=October 17, 2015 }}</ref> A final concern Maguire mentioned was the question of what to do with all the unused frozen [[embryos]].<blockquote>Now that I have children, I see those embryos as possible children. So I have to think about what my options are if there are leftovers again. I could keep them in storage, and maybe they will help my children some day. Or I can try to donate them to [[stem cell research]]. I don't think I could give them to another family. I would always worry: what if it's an abusive family? What if they don't get enough love?<ref name="common1"/>{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</blockquote>

'''Marlon "Marty" Raybon''' (born December 8, 1959) is an American [[country music]] artist. He is known primarily for his role as the lead singer of the country band [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], a role which he held from 1985 to 1997, until he rejoined the band in 2014. He recorded his first solo album, ''Marty Raybon'', in 1995 on [[Sparrow Records]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:09fuxqygldje~T1 |title=Marty Raybon biography |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |last=Hamilton |first=Andrew |work=[[Allmusic]]}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Before leaving Shenandoah in 1997, he and his brother Tim formed a duo known as the [[Raybon Brothers]], which had crossover success that year with the hit single "[[Butterfly Kisses (song)|Butterfly Kisses]]".

John Marty Stuart was born in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], on September 30, 1958.<ref name="whitburn"/> 

Stuart learned to play [[guitar]] and [[mandolin]] as a child, and by age 12, he had joined a gospel band called The Sullivans. While a member of this band, Stuart met mandolinist [[Roland White]], a member of [[Lester Flatt]]'s backing band; White invited Stuart to perform with Flatt at a concert in Delaware in 1972, which led to him becoming a regular member of that band. He continued to tour in this capacity until Flatt retired in 1978, and recorded an independent album called ''With a Little Help from My Friends'' that same year. After this, Stuart performed with [[Vassar Clements]] and [[Doc Watson]] before joining [[Johnny Cash]]'s band in 1980.<ref name="allmusic"/> 

In 1982, he released a second album called ''Busy Bee Cafe'' on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]]. The album was composed of a [[jam session]] that included a number of country and bluegrass performers such as Cash, Watson, and [[Earl Scruggs]]. In 1985, Stuart accompanied Johnny Cash to Memphis and played on the ''Class of '55'' album that also featured [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. At the end of the session, Perkins presented Stuart with his guitar.<ref>Dickerson, James L., ''Goin' Back to Memphis: A Century of Blues, Rock 'n' Roll and Glorious Soul'', Schirmer Books, 1996, pg. 12</ref> Later that year, Stuart left Cash's band and landed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/>

==Recording career==
Stuart released his [[Marty Stuart (album)|self-titled debut album]] on Columbia in 1985. The album accounted for Stuart's first chart entry on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts with his first single release, "[[Arlene (song)|Arlene]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> Three other singles charted from the album in 1986: "Honky Tonker" and "All Because of You", both written by [[Steve Forbert]], and Stuart's own "Do You Really Want My Lovin'". However, these songs were less successful on the charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> The success of "Arlene" helped Marty to receive a nomination by the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist]], losing to [[Randy Travis]]. [[AllMusic]] writer Jim Worbois gave the album a mixed review, stating that it was "Not a great album, but made somewhat more interesting by some of the people appearing on the record and the inclusion of two Steve Forbert songs."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/marty-stuart-mw0000083078 | title=''Marty Stuart'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=August 12, 2020 | author=Jim Worbois}}</ref> He recorded a second album for Columbia titled ''[[Let There Be Country]]'', which charted two singles in 1988: the [[Merle Haggard]] composition "Mirrors Don't Lie" and "Matches".<ref name="whitburn"/> Due to the underperformance of the singles, Columbia chose not to release the album, and Stuart exited the label to return to Mississippi.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===1989-91: Beginning of MCA Records tenure===
After briefly rejoining the Sullivans, he returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1989.<ref name="allmusic"/> That label issued the album ''[[Hillbilly Rock]]'' that year. Co-produced by [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] and session guitarist [[Richard Bennett (guitarist)|Richard Bennett]], the album charted four singles on Hot Country Songs. First was a cover of Cash's "[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]", followed by "Don't Leave Her Lonely Too Long", which Stuart wrote with [[Kostas (songwriter)|Kostas]]. While these were unsuccessful on the charts, the album's [[Hillbilly Rock (song)|title track]] (written by [[Paul Kennerley]]) became Stuart's first top-ten country hit in 1990.<ref name="whitburn"/> The album's final release was "[[Western Girls (Marty Stuart song)|Western Girls]]", which Stuart also co-wrote.<ref name="whitburn"/> ''Hillbilly Rock'' was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 1997 for shipments of 500,000 copies.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web | url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=marty+stuart#search_section | title=Search results for Marty Stuart | publisher=Recording Industry Association of America | access-date=August 14, 2020}}</ref>

His second MCA album, ''[[Tempted (Marty Stuart album)|Tempted]]'', followed in 1991. The album charted four singles on Hot Country Songs between 1991 and 1992: "[[Little Things (Marty Stuart song)|Little Things]]", "[[Till I Found You]]", "[[Tempted (Marty Stuart song)|Tempted]]", and "[[Burn Me Down (Marty Stuart song)|Burn Me Down]]", of which all except "Till I Found You" reached the top ten.<ref name="whitburn"/> Bennett and Brown stayed on as producers, with the former also contributing alongside Stuart on both guitar and mandolin. Kennerley and Kostas contributed as both songwriters and backing vocalists; also performing backing vocals on some tracks were Billy Thomas and [[Ray Herndon]], who were also recording on MCA in [[McBride & the Ride]] at the time.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Tempted |others=Marty Stuart |year=1991 |type=CD inssert |publisher=MCA Records |id=MCAD-10106}}</ref> Jana Pendragon of AllMusic gave the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, comparing it to [[Dwight Yoakam]]'s ''[[Hillbilly Deluxe (Dwight Yoakam album)|Hillbilly Deluxe]]'' in style and saying, "Stuart kicks country-pop in its well-defined hindquarters[…]But Stuart is just as deadly when he slows things down and does a ballad."<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r123530|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Tempted'' review|last=Pendragon|first=Jana|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=August 12, 2020}}</ref>

Also in 1991, Stuart co-wrote a song with [[Travis Tritt]] called "[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]". Recorded on the latter's 1991 album ''[[It's All About to Change]]'', this song was released in between "Tempted" and "Burn Me Down". It would go on to become Stuart's highest chart entry, reaching number two on Hot Country Songs in early 1992.<ref name="whitburn"/> It also won Stuart his first [[Grammy Award]], for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] that year.<ref name="grammy">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/marty-stuart/6414 | title=Search results for Marty Stuart | publisher=Grammy.com | access-date=August 11, 2020}}</ref> This song's success also led to the two touring in 1992 as the No Hats Tour, a reference to the fact that unlike most contemporary country musicians, neither Tritt nor Stuart sported a [[cowboy hat]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://ew.com/article/1991/11/29/no-hats-tour/ | title=The No Hats Tour -- Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart refuse to wear cowboy headgear | magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date=November 29, 1991 | access-date=August 14, 2020 | author=Ron Givens}}</ref>

[[File:Travis Tritt concert 1-18-2014.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Stuart is a frequent collaborator of [[Travis Tritt]], pictured here in 2014.]]
His next MCA album, ''[[This One's Gonna Hurt You]]'', came out in 1992. The lead single "[[This One's Gonna Hurt You (For a Long, Long Time)]]", also a duet with Tritt, was a top-ten hit in 1992, but the followup singles "Now That's Country", "High on a Mountain Top", and "Hey Baby" were less successful.<ref name="whitburn"/> Kennerley and Cash were once again among the contributing vocalists, while [[Ashley Cleveland]] and [[Pam Tillis]] both sang backing vocals on "High on a Mountain Top".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/this-ones-gonna-hurt-you-mw0000081284 | title=''This One's Gonna Hurt You'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=August 12, 2020 | author=Thom Jurek}}</ref> Johnny Cash provided duet vocals on "Doin' My Time", while the track "Me and Hank and Jumpin' Jack Flash" [[sampling (music)|sampled]] voice recordings of Lester Flatt, [[Hank Williams]], and [[Ernest Tubb]].<ref name="ew hurt"/> [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated the album "A", finding the "stylistic mix" superior to preceding albums, noting influences of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Southern rock]], [[rockabilly]], and [[blues]] in his delivery and song choices.<ref name="ew hurt">{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/1992/07/24/this-ones-gonna-hurt-you/ | title=''This One's Gonna Hurt You'' | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=July 24, 1992 | access-date=August 14, 2020 | author=Alanna Nash}}</ref> Also in 1992, Columbia issued ''Let There Be Country''.<ref name="allmusic"/> ''This One's Gonna Hurt You'' was certified gold by the RIAA in 1993.<ref name="riaa"/> Stuart won his second Grammy Award in 1993, in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]], as one of several featured artists on [[Asleep at the Wheel]]'s cover of "[[Red Wing (song)|Red Wing]]" on their 1993 album ''[[Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys]]''.<ref name="grammy"/>

''[[Love and Luck (album)|Love and Luck]]'' was his next album, released in 1994.<ref name="allmusic"/> Only one single, "Kiss Me, I'm Gone", made top 40 from the project.<ref name="whitburn"/> Stuart co-produced the album with Brown, while also contributing on guitar, mandolin, and songwriting.

Following this album, MCA issued a compilation called ''[[The Marty Party Hit Pack]]'' in 1995, which contained singles from his previous MCA albums, as well as "The Whiskey Ain't Workin'", the previously-unreleased "The Likes of Me" and "If I Ain't Got You", and two cover songs previously found on multi-artist tribute albums released in 1994. These were a rendition of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Don't Be Cruel]]", featuring [[The Jordanaires]] and previously found on ''It's Now or Never: The Tribute to Elvis'', and [[The Band]]'s "[[The Weight]]", featuring [[The Staple Singers]] and previously found on ''[[Rhythm, Country and Blues]]''.

Stuart released ''[[Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best]]'' in 1996, which produced two more minor chart entries in [[Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best (song)|the title track]] (another duet with Tritt) and "You Can't Stop Love" that year.<ref name="whitburn"/> The title track also won Stuart a Vocal Event of the Year award from the [[Country Music Association]].<ref name="whitburn"/> Nash rated the album "A−", finding an influence of [[The Beatles]] in "Thanks to You" and of [[Delta blues]] in "The Mississippi Mudcat and Sister Sheryl Crow".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/1996/07/12/honky-tonkins-what-i-do-best/ | title=''Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best'' | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=July 12, 1996 | access-date=August 14, 2020 | author=Alanna Nash}}</ref>

==Career since the late 1990s==
Stuart released another album in 1999 called ''[[The Pilgrim (Marty Stuart album)|The Pilgrim]]''. It charted only one single that year with "Red, Red Wine and Cheatin' Songs".<ref name="allmusic"/> A [[concept album]] based around a [[love triangle]], the album featured vocal contributions from Pam Tillis, [[George Jones]], and [[Emmylou Harris]], as well as a poem recited by Johnny Cash. An uncredited review of the album in AllMusic was largely favorable, stating that "no one's idea of a commercial country album, one has to admire the sheer ambition of the project, as well as the guts it took MCA Records to release what amounts to a unique and deeply personal artistic vision."<ref name="allmusic pilgrim">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-pilgrim-mw0000239885 | title=''The Pilgrim'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=August 14, 2020}}</ref> After this album proved to be commercially unsuccessful, Stuart left MCA in 2000.<ref name="allmusic"/>

His next album was 2003's ''[[Country Music (Marty Stuart album)|Country Music]]'', released on [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> For this album, Stuart assembled a new backing band called Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives, consisting of Harry Stinson on drums, [[Kenny Vaughan]] on guitar, and Brian Glenn on bass guitar.<ref name="freep super">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/361942751/ | title=Reviews | work=[[Detroit Free Press]] | date=July 6, 2003 | access-date=August 14, 2020}}</ref> Included on the albums were covers of [[Porter Wagoner]]'s "[[A Satisfied Mind]]", [[Carl Butler and Pearl]]'s "Sundown in Nashville",<ref name="freep super"/> and Johnny Cash's "Walls of a Prison", as well as the [[Merle Haggard]] duet "Farmer's Blues".<ref name="jurek"/> Two singles from the album both charted: "If There Ain't, There Ought'a Be" and "Too Much Month (At the End of the Money)".<ref name="whitburn"/> Thom Jurek of AllMusic wrote that the album "is relentless in both its attack and in the pleasure it provides to the listener. There are hot licks everywhere, with great songs, vocals, and a tapestry of moods, textures, and shades that serve to leave one impression: Stuart's radical experimentation of the last ten years has resulted in his finest moment thus far."<ref name="jurek">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/country-music-mw0000036484 | title=''Country Music'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=August 14, 2020}}</ref>

In 2005, Stuart launched a custom record label, Superlatone Records, to issue overlooked Southern [[Gospel music|Gospel]] and Roots music recordings. Stuart released three critically acclaimed collections on Superlatone, ''Souls' Chapel'', ''Badlands'', and ''Live at the Ryman''. In October 2005, Stuart released a concept album, ''Badlands: Ballads of the Lakota'', which pays tribute to the [[Sioux]] culture in what is now [[South Dakota]].  In 2007, Stuart produced [[Porter Wagoner]]'s final album on the predominantly punk label [[Epitaph Records]].

==The Fabulous Superlatives==

==Musical style==
In a 1992 article for ''Entertainment Weekly'', Kate Meyers wrote that Stuart "considers himself more a stylist than a singer, meaning he gets by with a mix of approaches...rather than relying on a fantastic voice of his own", citing Johnny Cash, [[Bill Monroe]], and [[Muddy Waters]] as his main musical influences.<ref name="meyers">{{cite magazine | url=https://ew.com/article/1992/09/18/road-marty-stuart/ | title=On the road with Marty Stuart | magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date=September 18, 1992 | access-date=August 14, 2020 | author=Kate Meyers}}</ref> Stuart's musical image in the 1990s was also defined by his distinct clothing and hairstyle. Meyers described him as having a "striking black mane, speckled with well-earned gray...[o]ften tied in a black or pink [[bandana]] headband", faded jeans from [[Levi Strauss & Co.]], a black T-shirt, [[cowboy boots]], a [[concho belt]], and a [[rhinestone]]-studded suit jacket designed by [[Nudie Cohn]] (sometimes termed the "Nudie suit").<ref name="meyers"/>

==Equipment and memorabilia==
Stuart is known for his extensive collection of country music memorabilia. Some of his collection was exhibited at the [[Tennessee State Museum]] in 2007 as "Sparkle & Twang: Marty Stuart's American Musical Odyssey." The  exhibit later appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, and at the Arkansas Statehouse Museum.  In early 2018, Stuart co-curated, along with the [[Grammy Museum]], an exhibit at the [[Woody Guthrie Center]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], entitled "Marty Stuart's Way Out West: A Country Music Odyssey". The exhibit highlighted the West Coast impact on country music, featuring items by artists including Johnny Cash, [[Merle Haggard]], [[Buck Owens]], and Stuart himself. Many of the items in the exhibit came from the private collection of Stuart, including the last portrait of Cash (taken by Stuart four days before Cash died).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/music/marty-stuart-launches-way-out-west-exhibit-at-woody-guthrie/article_3f6a0138-8fb6-59f8-ab44-0eb4365f4183.html|title=Marty Stuart launches 'Way Out West' exhibit at Woody Guthrie Center|first=Jimmie Tramel Tulsa|last=World|date=24 January 2018 }}</ref>

==History==
The band was formed in 1998 by Barry Abernathy, [[Steve Gulley]] (vocals, guitar), [[Adam Steffey]] (mandolin), and [[Jim Van Cleve|Jim VanCleve]]. Johnny Dowdle was introduced early as the band's original bassist. For a short period, Adam Steffey left the band to play with bluegrass/gospel group [[The Isaacs]], during which Steffey was replaced by Alan Perdue. Early in 2000, Dowdle left the group and was replaced by Jason Moore, the former bassist for the James King Band. In 2001, Steffey returned to the group, and Mountain Heart added virtuoso guitarist, Clay Jones,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mountain-tradition-mw0000346426 |title=Mountain Tradition - Clay Jones &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2005-06-28 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> in 2003.

Mountain Heart performed in Scarborough, Ontario as part of the Bluegrass Sundays Winter Concert Series in 2000 and 2001.<ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, February 2000</ref><ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, April 2001</ref> In 2005, they took part in the Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival.<ref>"Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival", ''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, October 2005</ref> Later, in 2007, the band revisited Canada when they played the [[Tottenham Bluegrass Festival]] in Ontario.<ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, June 2007</ref>

The band released their first, eponymous project in 1999, on [[Doobie Shea Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1434148/doobie-shea-records-shutters |title=Doobie Shea Records Shutters |publisher=Billboard |date=2004-07-06 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> following it quickly with an all-gospel release, ''The Journey''.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://ibmaawards.org/node/42#gospe |title=Recipient History &#124; IBMA Awards |accessdate=February 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225135634/http://ibmaawards.org/node/42 |archivedate=February 25, 2013 }}</ref> In 2001, the band signed with Skaggs Family Records and soon released ''No Other Way'', their first for the label.<ref>{{cite web|author=Erik Hage |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/no-other-way-mw0000662137 |title=No Other Way - Mountain Heart &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2002-09-17 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> The project was nominated for Album of the Year by the IBMA, with Mountain Heart being nominated for Entertainer of the Year. In 2004, they released ''Force Of Nature'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/force-of-nature-mw0000453418 |title=Force of Nature - Mountain Heart &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2004-05-11 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> which again earned the band nominations for Album of the Year and Entertainer of the Year. The group released their final Skaggs Family Records recording in 2005, entitled ''Wide Open''.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Christopher Monger |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wide-open-mw0000344993 |title=Wide Open - Mountain Heart &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> The album, produced by [[Mark Bright (record producer)|Mark Bright]], was notable for a stylistic departure for the band into the americana/folk/country sound.

In December 2006, the band announced that lead singer, [[Steve Gulley]], would be leaving the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/mountain-heart-announcement-expected-soon/ |title=Mountain Heart announcement expected soon |publisher=Bluegrass Today |date=2007-01-04 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> In January 2007, [[Josh Shilling]] debuted as the band's new lead singer at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in Nashville, TN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/the-new-guy-with-mountain-heart/ |title=The 'new guy' with Mountain Heart |publisher=Bluegrass Today |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> In September of that year, Jones was replaced by Grammy Award winning guitarist, Clay Hess.

The '''Nashville Bluegrass Band''' is an American [[bluegrass music]] ensemble founded in 1984.

The group's members first played together in 1984 as a backing band for [[Vernon Oxford]] and [[Minnie Pearl]]; each of the members was an established musician from the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] bluegrass community.<ref name="agent">{{cite web|url=http://www.keithcase.com/profiles/Nash/index.htm|title=Nashville Bluegrass Band Biography|publisher=Keith Case & Associates|accessdate=August 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806025254/http://www.keithcase.com/profiles/Nash/index.htm|archivedate=August 6, 2010}}</ref> They signed to [[Rounder Records]] and recorded their [[Béla Fleck]]-produced debut, ''My Native Home'', in 1985. Incorporating elements of black [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s, then a rarity in bluegrass, they became critical and popular successes both in America and abroad. The group toured in some 20 countries and were the first bluegrass band to ever play in [[China]].<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p665/biography|pure_url=yes}} Nashville Bluegrass Band] at [[Allmusic]]</ref>

The group continued to record for Rounder and [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill]] into the 1990s; two of the albums, 1993's ''Waitin' for the Hard Times to Go'' and 1995's ''Unleashed'', won [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album|Grammy Awards for Best Bluegrass Album]].<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p665/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Grammy Awards], Allmusic.com</ref> Other albums were nominated for Grammys in the same category in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1998, and 2004.<ref name=amg/> After the departure of bassist Gene Libbea and mandolinist [[Roland White]] in 1998, the group went on a brief hiatus, but after vocalist Pat Enright sang as one of the [[Soggy Bottom Boys]] from ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', the group's career had a revival. They played as the backing group for many performers on the ''[[Down from the Mountain]]'' tour and album, and toured again on their own in the 2000s.

She is the lead vocalist for the country band [[the Chicks]].

In 1995, after leaving [[Berklee College of Music]], Maines was recruited by the Dixie Chicks to replace their lead singer, Laura Lynch. With Maines as lead vocalist, the band earned 10 [[Country Music Association Awards]] and 13 [[Grammy Award]]s for their work between 1998 and 2007.

In 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''. The album subsequently won five [[Grammy Awards]] (including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]). After dropping the "Dixie", the Chicks new album ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]]'' was released on July 17, 2020. As a solo artist, Maines released the album, ''[[Mother (Natalie Maines album)|Mother]]'', on May 7, 2013.

== Early life ==
Maines was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to country musician and producer [[Lloyd Maines]] and Tina May Maines. She attended Nat Williams Elementary School in Lubbock, where her second grade teacher recalls being told by Maines during a math lesson, "Teacher, I don't need to learn this stuff—I'm gonna be a star."<ref name="Dickerson" /> Maines was a cheerleader while attending O. L. Slaton Junior High School,<ref name="Dickerson" />  and graduated in 1992 from [[Lubbock High School]] where she had participated in the school [[choir]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amc-music.com/musicmaking/play@school/artists.htm |title=Play at School |publisher=American Music Conference |access-date=April 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928211031/http://www.amc-music.com/musicmaking/play@school/artists.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> Maines has described growing up in conservative [[Texas]], saying "I always rebelled against that. My parents sent me and my sister to public minority schools so I always felt like a hippie and a rebel. ... As a teenager I always loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought. I always stood up for minorities. ... I've always stood up for homosexuals. I just always had these really strong convictions about doing so."<ref name="Heysen">Heysen, Kristen. (October 8, 2006) [http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20541859-5006343,00.html Not ready to make nice] AdelaideNow. Retrieved April 3, 2007.</ref>

Following the completion of high school, Maines attended several colleges. She spent two semesters pursuing an undeclared major at [[West Texas A&M University|West Texas A&M]] where her studies focused heavily on radio, then a year and a half at [[South Plains College]]. One of Maines's instructors at South Plains, and a former member of [[The Maines Brothers Band]], Cary Banks, recalled "She was mostly into [[rock'n'roll]], [[rhythm and blues]] ... [[alternative rock]]." When Banks encountered Maines on campus, he said that she usually needed to vent a little steam. "She would get into a lot of political arguments" at the predominantly Republican school, and was a fan of Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]]. "She's always been opinionated and hardheaded like her dad."<ref name="Dickerson" />  In December 1994, Maines auditioned for and received a full vocal scholarship to Berklee College of Music. She pursued the diploma program at Berklee but dropped out before the completion of her studies. Even though Maines is from Lubbock, home of [[Texas Tech University]], she attended only one class at the school, a 1995 summer course in "Introductory Wildlife".<ref name="Dickerson" />

== Career ==
Maines's first professional recording was lead vocals on the song "White Women's Clothes" on Andy Wilkinson's album "Charlie Goodnight's Life in Poetry and Song." Maines's first commercially released work was [[backing vocalist|background vocals]] on [[Pat Green]]'s debut album, ''Dancehall Dreamer'', produced by her father Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. At the end of 1995, at age 21, Maines joined the all-female [[country music]] band, the then named [[Dixie Chicks]], which had been performing since 1989, but which had been unsuccessful in gaining more than local attention. Maines replaced founding lead singer Laura Lynch.  She plays guitar and bass in concert in the band.<ref>{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Rob |url=http://dixiechicksfaq.homestead.com/files/chicks.htm#_28.__What |title=Dixie Chicks FAQ No.&nbsp;30 |access-date=April 12, 2007}}</ref>

Maines co-wrote four tracks for The Chicks' first three albums, including the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart number one hit "[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]" on ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]''. Maines was a primary songwriter on all 14 tracks of the band's 2006 album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' which peaked on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart at No.&nbsp;1. ''Taking the Long Way'' has the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]", (Maines, Strayer, Erwin, Wilson) hitting No.&nbsp;4<ref name="Billboard">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dixie chicks|chart=all}} |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125545/http://{{billboardurlbyname|artist=dixie/}} |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |title=Dixie Chicks: Singles |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and for which the band won the songwriting Grammy Award, for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. Maines considers the songwriting she did for ''Taking the Long Way'' "pure therapy" after the controversy that ensued over a comment Maines made from the stage in London that criticized U.S. President [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="Burkeman">{{cite news |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |date=March 25, 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,1739311,00.html |title=Dixie Chicks turn death threats to song |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=March 18, 2007}}</ref> "Everything felt more personal this time", Maines said about the album, "there's just more maturity, depth, intelligence. ... [These songs] feel more grown-up."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |date=March 10, 2006 |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/59125/dixie-chicks-get-personal-on-long-way |title=Dixie Chicks Get Personal On 'Long Way' |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>

Maines collaborates with other musical artists, both as a member of the Chicks and an individual singer. The Chicks first worked with [[Sheryl Crow]] in 1999 while performing for the concert tour [[Lilith Fair]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=December 3, 1999 |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12032703 |title=Dixie Chicks And Sheryl Crow Prove They're Gutsy Women |publisher=Yahoo!Music |access-date=June 1, 2007}}</ref> Since then, the Chicks have worked with Crow on her ''[[Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park]]'' album, a Crow remixed version of "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]" performed by the Chicks, and the Chicks' song "Favorite Year" from ''Taking the Long Way''.  Maines has performed with artists including Pat Green, [[Charlie Robison]], [[Yellowcard]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Patty Griffin]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Pete Yorn]] and [[Ben Harper]].

On May 7, 2013, Maines released a solo album entitled ''[[Mother (Natalie Maines album)|Mother]]''.<ref name="tasteofcountry.com">{{Cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/dixie-chicks-natalie-maines-pink-floyd-mother-video/|title=Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines Covers Pink Floyd's 'Mother'|first=Cory|last=Stromblad|website=Taste of Country|date=July 19, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="twitter.com">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/1NatalieMaines/status/281263948551057408|title=@JRig2010 @tray2276 May 7th.|first=Natalie|last=Maines|date=December 18, 2012}}</ref> This was Maines's first album since the Chicks hiatus started in 2007.

On May 21, 2006, while promoting the release of the album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', Maines recanted her 2003 apology to President Bush, saying, "I don't feel that way anymore.

Maines says she is not looking for more battles but that "The Incident," as it is referred to by the Dixie Chicks, reminded her of how she "felt in high school: to be angry, to be sure that you're right and that the things you do matter. You don't realize that you're not feeling those feelings until you do. And then you realize how much more interesting life is."<ref name="Tryangiel" />

Two 2006 documentaries, ''[[Protesting the Dixie Chicks]]'' and ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing|Shut Up And Sing]]'', deal with the controversy surrounding Maines's comment and the ensuing fallout. In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' on June 15, 2006, regarding the fallout from her comment, Maines again stirred up controversy by stating:<blockquote>The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism; Why do you have to be a patriot?

In 2007, the Dixie Chicks won three Grammys for "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]" and two Grammys for ''Taking the Long Way'', receiving all five Grammys for which they were nominated. This was seen by some as vindication for the Dixie Chicks, who were shunned by country radio programmers after Maines's remarks about President Bush. As the Dixie Chicks accepted the album of the year award, Maines said, "I think people are using their freedom of speech with all these awards.

Maines publicly criticized Keith's song "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" by saying, "I hate it. It's ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant. It targets an entire culture—and not just the bad people who did bad things. You've got to have some tact. Anybody can write, 'We'll put a boot in your ass.'"<ref>''LA Daily News''.

After Maines commented at a March 2003 Dixie Chicks concert at the Shepherd's Bush Empire theatre in London that the Dixie Chicks didn't want the [[Iraq War]] and were "ashamed" President Bush "was from Texas", Keith's 2003 "[[Shock'n Y'all]]" tour began displaying a backdrop showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name="BBCfreshrow">BBC News.

In the 2006 documentary ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]'', backstage footage prior to her appearance wearing the F.U.T.K. shirt recorded the conversation between Maines and Simon Renshaw and confirmed that the original intent of the shirt was in response to Keith's criticism of her: the letters stood for "Fuck You Toby Keith".<ref name="Kopple" /> As of January 2007, Keith continued to refuse to say Maines's name and argues that the doctored photos displayed during his concerts were intended to express his feeling that Maines's criticism was tyrannical and a dictator-like attempt to squelch Keith's free speech.<ref>Guzman, Rafer.

'''Nitty Gritty Dirt Band''' (sometimes abbreviated '''NGDB'''), known as '''the Dirt Band''' from 1978 to 1983, is an American band founded in [[Long Beach, California]], in 1966. Since 2018, the band has consisted of [[Jeff Hanna]] and his son Jaime Hanna, both guitarists and vocalists, along with Jimmie Fadden (drums, harmonica, vocals), Bob Carpenter (keyboards, accordion, vocals), [[Ross Holmes]] (fiddle, mandolin, vocals), and [[Jim Photoglo]] (bass guitar, vocals).

Jeff Hanna and Fadden founded the band in 1966 with a lineup initially consisting of Bruce Kunkel, Ralph Barr, Les Thompson, and [[Jackson Browne]], who quit early on and was replaced by longtime member [[John McEuen]] (vocals, guitar, banjo). The band had its first hit single in 1967 with "Buy for Me the Rain" on [[Liberty Records]]. Their earliest work featured [[jug band]] and traditional [[folk music|folk]] elements. In 1970, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had their biggest pop hit with a cover of [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]'s "[[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]". The band's sound took on elements of [[soft rock]] in the latter half of the 1970s and early 1980s, including the hit singles "[[An American Dream (song)|An American Dream]]" and "Make a Little Magic".

Starting in 1983, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band began a shift toward [[country music]], led off by the singles "Shot Full of Love" and "[[Dance Little Jean]]". By this point, the band consisted of Jeff Hanna, McEuen, Fadden, Carpenter, and [[Jimmy Ibbotson]] (bass guitar, vocals). This lineup recorded several country albums for [[Warner Records]] throughout the 1980s and charted multiple singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]]. Of these, "[[Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper's Dream)]]", "[[Modern Day Romance]]", and "[[Fishin' in the Dark]]" all went to number one, with the latter becoming their [[signature song]]. After leaving Warner in the late 1980s, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recorded for several other labels, including [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal]], [[MCA Nashville]], [[Rising Tide Records|Rising Tide]], and [[DreamWorks Records]]. The band has collaborated with a number of artists, including [[Doc Watson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[John Denver]], and [[Steve Martin]]. In addition, Hanna co-wrote [[Rascal Flatts]]'s 2005 single "[[Bless the Broken Road]]", which was originally recorded by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band has released three collaborative albums: ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken (album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' (1972), ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two]]'' in 1989, and ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III]]'' in 2002. All three albums featured a large number of guests from folk, rock, country, and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. They have also won three [[Grammy Awards]]. The band's sound draws influence from country, pop, rock, bluegrass, and folk music, and has seen generally positive critical reception.

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded in [[Long Beach, California]], in 1966. Founding guitarist [[Jeff Hanna]] was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, but his family had moved to Long Beach four years prior.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> While in high school, he befriended guitarist Bruce Kunkel, and the two played in a local duo called the New Coast Two.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-nitty-gritty-dirt-band-mn0000718907 | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band biography | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=July 8, 2024 | author=Mark Deming}}</ref> As they wanted to form a larger group, the two began playing impromptu jam sessions at a Long Beach music shop called McCabe's Guitar Shop. Through these performances, they recruited four other musicians. These were Jimmie Fadden, who at the time played [[washtub bass]], harmonica, and guitar, along with Ralph Barr (guitar, clarinet), Les Thompson (guitar, [[mandolin]]), and [[Jackson Browne]] (guitar). All six members also served as vocalists. Browne quit the group after only a few months,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hinton |first=Brian |title=Country Roads: How Country Came to Nashville |date=June 26, 2012 |location=London, England |publisher=Bobcat Books |isbn=978-0857128447 |page=574 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jzYDAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT574 |access-date=November 25, 2019 }}</ref> and was replaced by [[John McEuen]], who contributed on guitar, mandolin, banjo, and washtub bass.<ref name="allmusic"/> They briefly called themselves the Illegitimate Jug Band, due to their playing [[jug band]] music without actually having a member who played the [[jug (instrument)|jug]]. Soon afteward, they selected Nitty Gritty Dirt Band as a name.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> This name was inspired by their observation that many bands at the time had names which they considered long and unusual, such as [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]].<ref name="oklahoman">{{cite news | url=https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/1986/09/21/dirt-band-getting-down-to-nitty-gritty/62714337007/ | title=Dirt Band Getting Down to Nitty Gritty | work=[[The Oklahoman]] | date=September 21, 1986 | accessdate=July 11, 2024 | author=Tony Frazier}}</ref>

===1967{{ndash}}1971: Early years===
John's older brother [[William E. McEuen]] served as the band's manager, helping to book them as opening acts for artists such as [[Joan Baez]]. He also helped the band sign a contract with [[Liberty Records]], who released the band's [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1967.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> "Buy for Me the Rain" was released as a single from this project, and it reached number 45 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="whitburn2010">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Top Pop Singles 1955–2010|publisher=Record Research, Inc|page=653|year=2011|isbn=978-0-89820-188-8}}</ref> The band released another album for Liberty, ''[[Ricochet (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Ricochet]]'', later in 1967. After this album, Kunkel quit over creative differences in the band's sound, and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist [[Chris Darrow]], formerly a member of [[Kaleidoscope (American band)|Kaleidoscope]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Dirt Band Drops Ork-Rock, Gets Back To Nitty Gritty |magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]] |volume=29 |issue=21 |date=December 16, 1967 |location=New York City|page=46 |url=https://americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/60s/1967/CB-1967-12-16-OCR-Page-0044.pdf |access-date=November 25, 2019 }}</ref><ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="virgin">{{cite book | title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music | publisher=Virgin Books | author=Colin Larkin | year=1998 | pages=306–307 | isbn=0-7535-0236-4}}</ref> Of their style at the time, Mary Campbell of the [[Associated Press]] noted the band's use of acoustic instruments and rudimentary traditional folk instruments such as washtub bass, [[kazoo]], and [[comb and paper]]. She also noted that their clothing and song choices, such as a cover of "[[Teddy Bears' Picnic]]", reflected the music and mindset of the 1920s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/114660103/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band mixes then and now | work=[[Poughkeepsie Journal]] | date=October 14, 1967 | accessdate=July 8, 2024 | author=Mary Campbell | pages=1, 3}}</ref>

Their third album, 1968's ''[[Rare Junk]]'', was their first to feature electric guitar, electric bass, and drums.<ref name="allmusic"/> Although Browne had left the band by this point, they covered his "[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]" on it.

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band reunited in 1970, although Darrow and Barr declined to rejoin.

Colin Larkin, in the ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', wrote that this album marked a shift in the band's sound from "jokey elements" to a more [[country rock]] sound.<ref name="virgin"/> It featured a cover of [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]'s "[[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]".

[[File:Doc Watson Sugar Grove.jpg|125px|thumb|left|Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1972 album ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' featured a number of collaborators, including Doc Watson.|alt=Doc Watson playing an acoustic guitar.]]
Liberty Records merged with [[United Artists Records]] in 1972. The band's first project for this label was 1972's ''[[All the Good Times]]''. The album had further cover songs on it, including [[Hank Williams]]'s "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]" and [[Doug Kershaw]]'s "[[Diggy Liggy Lo]]",<ref name="encyclopedia"/> as well as another Jackson Browne cover, "Jamaica".<ref name="shine">{{cite news |author=Henry McNulty | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/368444876/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band shines on | work=[[Hartford Courant]] | date=February 19, 1972 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | pages=18}}</ref> The former of these was issued as a single, but peaked in the lower end of the Hot 100.<ref name="whitburn2010"/> ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' writer Henry McNulty found the cover songs superior to the original cuts on the album, but criticized the band for including fake applause between tracks.<ref name="shine"/>

Also in 1972, the band traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to record the album ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken (album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]''. This was a collaborative three-disc album featuring a number of country and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artists, such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Maybelle Carter]], [[Earl Scruggs]], and [[Doc Watson]].<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="encyclopedia"/> Writing for ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', Robert Hillburn thought that the band showed appreciation for the music of the collaborators, and that the album would appeal to music fans who did not like the then-contemporary [[Nashville sound]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/385794163/ | title=If you're dreaming of a Phil Spector Christmas | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 17, 1972 | accessdate=July 9, 2024 | author=Robert Hillburn | pages=70}}</ref> The album also accounted for the band's first entries on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: a cover of Hank Williams's "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]" and the original "Grand Ole Opry Song", respectively featuring guest vocals from Roy Acuff and [[Jimmy Martin]].<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=260|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref> Following the commercial success of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'', the band began touring across the United States and internationally. McEuen also began recording as a solo artist at this point while maintaining his membership with the band.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> Larkin noted that critical reception of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' "played an important role in breaking down mistrust between country's establishment and the emerging '[[hippie|long hair]]' practitioners."<ref name="virgin"/> Similarly, Watson later attributed the album's success to renewed interest in his music, particularly among fans of rock music who did not typically listen to folk and bluegrass.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/77492612/ | title=Guitars forever duel in Doc Watson's soul | work=Herald and Review | date=June 17, 1978 | accessdate=July 11, 2024 | pages=16}}</ref> The "I Saw the Light" cover accounted for the band's first [[Grammy Award]] nomination, in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]; a year later, the album itself was nominated in the same category.<ref name="grammy">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/nitty-gritty-dirt-band/14642 | title=Search results for Nitty Gritty Dirt Band | publisher=Grammy.com | accessdate=July 12, 2024}}</ref> In 1997, the project became the band's first album to be certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name="riaa">{{cite web | url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=nitty+gritty+dirt+band#search_section | title=Search results for Nitty Gritty Dirt Band | publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] | accessdate=July 9, 2024}}</ref>

Their next album for United Artists was 1974's ''[[Stars & Stripes Forever (album)|Stars & Stripes Forever]]''. By this point, Thompson had left as well, leaving the band as a quartet.<ref name="allmusic"/> A cover of [[Johnny Horton]]'s "[[The Battle of New Orleans]]" charted from this project.<ref name="whitburn2010"/> The album, composed of both live and studio recordings, also featured interview segments by fiddle player [[Vassar Clements]]. Bruce Eder thought these elements made the album "more than its money's worth" and capable of showing the band's mix of country and rock influences.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/stars-stripes-forever-mw0000644758 | title=''Stars & Stripes Forever'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Bruce Eder}}</ref> A year later, they released ''[[Symphonion Dream]]'', led off by a cover of [[the Everly Brothers]]' "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]".<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="whitburn2010"/> The album featured guest contributions from [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Leon Russell]], and actor [[Gary Busey]].

===1978{{ndash}}1981: The Dirt Band and shift to soft rock===
In 1978, both Clark and Cable left the band, which by this point had shortened its name to just the Dirt Band.<ref name="allmusic"/> McEuen said that the decision to become just the Dirt Band was due to disc jockeys not being comfortable with the longer name.{{sfn|McEuen|2017|pp=163-164}} Conversely, music writer Tom Roland attributed the name change to Chuck Morris, who had taken over as the band's manager due to William E. McEuen becoming overwhelmed by the role.{{sfn|Roland|1991|pp=394-395}} Also according to John McEuen, Clark left voluntarily, while he believes that Hanna "got rid" of Cable because he felt "threatened" by Cable's songwriting ability.{{sfn|McEuen|2017|p=155}} Joining Hanna, John McEuen, and Fadden as members were drummer Merel Bergante, bassist Richard Hathaway, and Al Garth, who played multiple instruments including saxophone and keyboards.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Herbeck |first=Ray Jr. |title=The Dirt Band, Le Roux, Roxy, Los Angeles |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=90 |issue=27 |date=July 8, 1978 |location=New York City |page=40 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/70s/1978/Billboard%201978-07-08-OCR-Page-0040.pdf |access-date=November 25, 2019 }}</ref> The band's first release under the shortened name was 1978's ''[[The Dirt Band (album)|The Dirt Band]]''.<ref name="erlewine dirt">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dirt-band-mw0000345438 | title=''The Dirt Band'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=July 11, 2024 | author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]}}</ref> "In for the Night" reached the lower regions of the Hot 100 as a single from this project.<ref name="whitburn2010"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic thought the album marked a shift in the band's sound to a [[soft rock]] style. He thought the songs on the album were consistent in quality, but also thought that the album would not appeal to fans of their earlier works.<ref name="erlewine dirt"/> Also during 1978, the band appeared under the pseudonym the Toot Uncommons as backing musicians on comedian and actor [[Steve Martin]]'s novelty hit single "[[King Tut (song)|King Tut]]". This appearance was due to William E. McEuen serving as producer on the track.<ref name="allmusic"/>

After this album, [[EMI]] eliminated the United Artists label and reopened Liberty Records, transferring the band back to that label after a decade. Their first release upon returning to Liberty was 1981's ''[[Jealousy (Dirt Band album)|Jealousy]]''. Most of the band members wrote the songs on the album by themselves and Hanna co-produced the album.

[[File:Rodney Crowell 1.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Rodney Crowell wrote the band's singles "An American Dream" and "Long Hard Road".|alt=Rodney Crowell, playing an acoustic guitar while seated on a stool.]]
In 1983, the band reverted its name to Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Al Garth and Vic Mastrionni both quit the band at this point and Ibbotson rejoined as a vocalist and bass guitarist; as a result, Fadden began playing drums in addition to his existing role as harmonica player. At this point, the band began finding success in [[country music]], a move which McEuen attributed to changing tastes among fans of rock and pop music.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/622388616/ | title=Changing times find Dirt Band walking country road | work=[[The Charlotte Observer]] | date=September 30, 1983 | accessdate=July 11, 2024 | pages=4D}}</ref> Roland also attributes the shift in sound and reversion of their name to Morris;{{sfn|Roland|1991|pp=394-395}} McEuen also attributed both of these and the return of Ibbotson to the lineup as being decisions made by Morris.<ref name="vincennes"/> The first release to be successful on the country charts was "Shot Full of Love", which went to number 19 on the Hot Country Songs charts in 1983. This was followed by Ibbotson's composition "[[Dance Little Jean]]", which went to number nine.<ref name="whitburn"/> Both were included on the album ''[[Let's Go (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Let's Go]]'', their last after rejoining Liberty.<Ref name="allmusic"/> This album was produced by [[Norbert Putnam]] and [[Richard Landis]].<ref name="vincennes">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/437831667/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recognized as 'country' | work=[[Vincennes Sun-Commercial]] | date=August 19, 1984 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Mary Campbell | pages=7}}</ref>

The band began recording their next album, ''[[Plain Dirt Fashion]]'', while still on Liberty. However, Morris was uncertain if the label would promote the album properly, as it was the last one in their contract. As a result, the band transferred to [[Warner Records]], who released it in 1984. Furthering their move to country music, they also switched booking agents, which resulted in them opening shows for [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]]<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/80s/1984/BB-1984-08-25.pdf | title='Long Hard Road' to top for Nitty Gritty Dirt Band | author=Kip Kirby | magazine=Billboard | pages=54 | date=August 25, 1984}}</ref> [[Paul Worley]] and Marshall Morgan served as producers on the project. According to Ibbotson, the band chose to switch producers after moving to Warner, as they thought Putnam and Landis, despite working in country music, "thought they had to cover all bases."<ref name="vincennes"/> In addition to the five members of the band, other contributors included Skaggs and [[Jerry Douglas]].

===1985{{ndash}}1987: Middle years with Warner===
Next on Warner was ''[[Partners, Brothers and Friends (album)|Partners, Brothers and Friends]]'' in 1985. The album's lead single was "[[Modern Day Romance]]", written by [[Kix Brooks]], who would later become one-half of [[Brooks & Dunn]]. Upon release, this song became Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's second number-one on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Although Hanna or Carpenter usually sang lead vocals on singles, "Modern Day Romance" was one of several in this timespan to feature Ibbotson on lead vocals instead. Worley noted that the song had originally been submitted to the band for inclusion on ''Plain Dirt Fashion'' but was rejected, and they chose to record it after it was submitted to them a second time.{{sfn|Roland|1991|pp=430-431}} Also charting in the top ten from this album were "[[Home Again in My Heart]]" and the [[Partners, Brothers and Friends (song)|title track]], which Hanna and Ibbotson co-wrote.<ref name="whitburn"/> While not released as a single, the album track "Telluride" (also written by Ibbotson) was made into a music video. Robert K. Oermann of ''[[The Tennessean]]'' noted that the lyrics of "Partners, Brothers and Friends" contained several references to the band's career up to that point.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112438068/ | title=It's been a long haul for the Dirt Band | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=September 28, 1985 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Robert K.

This was followed in 1987 by ''[[Hold On (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Hold On]]'', led off by the single "[[Baby's Got a Hold on Me]]". It reached number two on the country charts upon release.

In 1989, the band transferred to [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal Records]], then a new country label started by producer [[Jimmy Bowen]]. Their only release for the label was ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two]]'', a sequel album to their 1972 album ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken''.

Next on Liberty was 1994's ''[[Acoustic (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Acoustic]]'', composed entirely of acoustic songs.

An uncredited ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' review stated that the original release  "helped knock down barriers then separating the traditional country and rock music communities, setting the stage for the eventual emergence of what came to be known as Americana music".<ref name="LA Times Lewis">{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Randy|title=Premiere: Jackson Browne joins Nitty Gritty Dirt Band for 50th|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-jackson-browne-nitty-gritty-dirt-band-20160909-snap-htmlstory.html|access-date=November 9, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|issue=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105901/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-jackson-browne-nitty-gritty-dirt-band-20160909-snap-htmlstory.html|archive-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref>

==Musical styles==
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's music encompasses a wide variety of styles. Colin Larkin, in ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', wrote that their early albums contained [[jug band]] and [[Vaudeville]] influences, while by the release of ''Uncle Charlie and His Dog Teddy'', the band "abandoned the jokey elements...[and] pursued a career as purveyors of superior [[country rock]]."<ref name="virgin"/> Mark Deming spoke similarly of their early material, noting influences of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] in the "Mr. Bojangles" cover as well as the tracks from the first ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' album. He also defined the band's late-1970s output as [[soft rock]], and that their 1990s and 21st-century material was indebted to [[American folk music]].<ref name="allmusic"/> On the same site, Stephen Thomas Erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on ''The Dirt Band''.<ref name="erlewine dirt"/> Rickey Ferguson thought the band's country influences were more evident on ''Plain Dirt Fashion'' due to the use of instruments such as [[Dobro]], [[fiddle]], and [[mandolin]].<ref name="rickey"/> Holly Gleason noted the [[twang]] evident in Hanna's and Ibbotson's singing voices, and thought the band's [[rhythm section]]s were stronger than usual for a country band.<ref name="gleason"/>

During the release of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'', the band members were noted for their long-haired appearance, which at the time was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time. [[Bill Monroe]] was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album, and [[Roy Acuff]] was initially apprehensive before joining.<ref name="gone"/> The band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after "An American Dream" and "Make a Little Magic", followed by a realization that members of the country music community in Nashville were still fans of their music.<ref name="gone"/> They also thought that the first two ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' projects helped to "dim the lines" between pop and country, especially since the genre of [[country rock]] was still new when the first one was recorded.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/212741105/ | title='The Circle' still unbroken | work=The Times | date=October 4, 1989 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Troy Moon | pages=6C}}</ref> Walter Tunis of the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' thought that the band was an early example of the California-based country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and that such a comparison was furthered when former Eagles member Bernie Leadon joined. He also thought that the band's success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself. Leadon also stated that he heard influences of the Eagles within the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's songs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/689099284/ | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band music still has its flavor of '70s | work=Lexington Herald-Leader | date=October 21, 1987 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Walter Tunis | pages=38}}</ref> Jim Wensits of ''[[The South Bend Tribune]]'' described the band as a "coming force in country rock" during the success of "Mr. Bojangles", and added that they "confounded critics by refusing to be categorized." He also thought that the band's sound during the 1970s was comparable to the Eagles, and that some songs such as their cover of "Jambalaya" featured influences of [[Cajun music]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/518398575/ | title=After 20 years, 'Nitty Gritty Band' continues to hit paydirt | work=The South Bend Tribune | date=September 14, 1986 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Jim Wensits | pages=C6}}</ref>

In a 2022 concert review, Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time opined that Jeff Hanna's "voice was well intact at 75" and that he had "an affable, easy going stage presence." He also noted that Jaime Hanna, Carpenter, and Fadden occasionally sang lead vocals as well. He also praised the use of fiddle and mandolin in their live settings.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://countrystandardtime.com/d/concertreview.asp?xid=1640 | title=Nitty Gritty Dirt Band is forever young | publisher=Country Standard Time | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Jeffrey B.

'''Norman L. Blake''' (born March 10, 1938) is a traditional American stringed instrument artist and songwriter. He is half of the eponymous '''Norman & Nancy Blake''' band with his wife, Nancy Blake.

==Music career==

===Early performing===
Blake was born in [[Chattanooga]], Tennessee, and grew up in [[Sulphur Springs, Alabama]]. He listened to old-time and country music on the radio by [[the Carter Family]], the [[Skillet Lickers]], [[Roy Acuff]], and the Monroe Brothers ([[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]] and [[Bill Monroe]]).<ref name="ND">{{cite web|title=Norman & Nancy Blake - The old-fashioned way|url=https://www.nodepression.com/norman-nancy-blake-the-old-fashioned-way/|website=No Depression|access-date=20 May 2019|date=1 January 2006}}</ref> He learned guitar at age 11 or 12, then [[mandolin]], [[dobro]], and [[fiddle]] in his teens. When he was 16, he dropped out of school to play music professionally.<ref name="Stone">{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Steven|title=Norman Blake|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/2902/norman-blake/|website=Vintage Guitar|access-date=26 November 2016|date=12 December 2003}}</ref>

In the 1950s, Blake joined the Dixieland Drifters and performed on radio broadcasts, then joined the Lonesome Travelers. When he was drafted in 1961, he served as an Army radio operator in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. He started a popular band known as the [[Fort Kobbe|Kobbe]] Mountaineers.<ref name="Stambler">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Stambler|first2=Lyndon|title=Folk and blues : the encyclopedia|date=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312200579|pages=34–35|edition=1}}</ref> A year later, while he was on leave, he recorded the album ''Twelve Shades of Bluegrass'' with the Lonesome Travelers.<ref name="Wolff">{{cite web|last1=Wolff|first1=Kurt|title=Norman Blake {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/norman-blake-mn0000387352/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref>

===Nashville and Johnny Cash===
After being discharged from the Army, Blake moved to Nashville and became a [[studio musician]].<ref name="Stambler" /> For ten years, he toured and recorded with country singer [[Johnny Cash]]<ref name="Wolff" /> and continued to play with Cash  intermittently over the next thirty.<ref name="Stone" /> He met Nancy Short, a cellist with a [[classical music]] background who was playing in a folk group. He was asked by [[Bob Dylan]] to play on the country-folk album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'', then became a member of the house band on Johnny Cash's TV show.<ref name="ND" /><ref name="Stambler" /> [[Kris Kristofferson]], one of the guests, hired Blake to tour with him. Blake recorded with folk singer [[Joan Baez]] and appeared on her hit song "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]".<ref name="Wolff" /> In 1971, he became a member of the bluegrass group Aero-plain, led by multi-instrumentalist [[John Hartford]] with fiddler [[Vassar Clements]], a short-lived project.<ref name="Stambler" /><ref name="Wolff" />

Blake also played dobro on the 1972 album ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]].<ref name="circle">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/will-the-circle-be-unbroken-mw0000193505/credits |title=Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Credits |website=AllMusic |access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref>

In 1972, Blake recorded his first solo album, ''[[Home in Sulphur Springs]]'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1972).<ref name="Wolff" /> Soon after his debut, he and Nancy recorded their first album, ''[[The Fields of November]]'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1974), with Nancy on hillbilly cello. They married in 1975 and performed together for twenty years.<ref name="ND" /><ref name="Stambler" />

===Style===
Most of the music that Norman Blake plays could be described as neo-traditionalist Americana folk and roots music (folk, bluegrass, country, blues), and many of the songs he plays are [[Traditional music|traditional]], but he plays this acoustic type of music with a style, speed, and quality that has evolved and progressed in the modern age. Though probably best known for his fluid renditions of classic fiddle tunes transcribed for the guitar ("Fiddler's Dram/Whiskey Before Breakfast"), Blake has also written songs that have become bluegrass and folk standards, such as "Ginseng Sullivan", "Slow Train through Georgia", "Billy Gray", and "Church Street Blues".

Blake has also written and published songs of a political nature, such as "Don’t Be Afraid of the Neo-Cons."<ref name=":0" />

Blake is known for his tastefully simple-sounding style, saying, "I’m more interested in the music and the tone than I am the licks."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Phil |date=2007-11-21 |title=Interview: Norman Blake |url=https://www.fretboardjournal.com/features/interview-norman-blake/ |access-date=2022-11-28 |website=Fretboard Journal |language=en}}</ref>

Although known as one of the most prominent steel-string guitar [[flatpicking|flatpickers]], Blake is a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist. Other instruments he plays include the [[mandolin]], [[Guitjo (six-string)|6-string banjo]], [[fiddle]], [[dobro]], [[banjo]] and [[viola]].<ref>CD liner notes from ''The Fields of November'', Flying Fish Records, 1992</ref> He is known for his loose, right-hand guitar technique, which arose out of his mandolin technique. Also well known is his devotion to 12-fret guitars, including Martin 00s, 000s, D18s, D28s, and Gibsons, like his 1929 12-fret Nick Lucas special.

=== Collaborations ===
Blake has collaborated with [[Tony Rice]] on the albums, "Blake and Rice," and "Blake and Rice 2," which include many tunes, including some of Blake's originals.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Rice |title=Blake & Rice |date=1992 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Blake-Rice-Tony-Norman/dp/B0000002HV |publisher=Rounder |language=English |access-date=2022-12-06 |last2=Norman Blake |last3=Norman Blake & Tony Rice}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Rice |title=Blake & Rice 2 |date=1992 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Blake-Rice-2-Norman-Tony/dp/B0000002JB |publisher=Rounder |language=English |access-date=2022-12-06 |last2=Norman Blake |last3=Norman Blake & Tony Rice}}</ref> Blake also released an album with Mike Compton called, "Gallop to Georgia," which showcases many Old-Time tunes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mike Compton |url=https://www.mikecompton.net/ |access-date=2022-12-06 |website=Mike Compton |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Awards and honors===
Blake played on the album ''[[Raising Sand]]'' by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Alison Krauss]], which won five Grammy Awards, and on the soundtrack ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', which won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].

Norman & Nancy Blake received Grammy nominations in the Best Traditional Folk Recording category for ''Blind Dog'', ''Just Gimme Somethin' I'm Used To'', ''While Passing Along This Way'', and ''The Hobo's Last Ride''. In 1986 Norman Blake was chosen Best Multi-Instrumentalist by the readers of ''Frets'' magazine.<ref>[http://www.flatpick.com/Pages/Featured_Artist/norman.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055726/http://www.flatpick.com/Pages/Featured_Artist/norman.html|date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>

'''Nothin' Fancy'''<ref name=belleville>[http://www.insidebelleville.com/whatson-story/3956437-nothing-fancy-is-fancy-perfection/ "Nothing Fancy is fancy perfection"]. ''Inside Belleville'', May 03, 2012</ref> is a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[musical group|band]] based in [[Buena Vista, Virginia]] and was formed in September 1994. Its "parent band"{{clarify|date=June 2022}} East Coast Bluegrass Band was formed Summer 1985 to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in [[Crimora, Virginia]].<ref>*[http://bluegrasscountry.org/programs/aotm/nothin-fancy/ Bluegrass Country] profile "October 2004: Nothin' Fancy".</ref>

== History ==
=== East Coast Bluegrass Band ===
The East Coast Bluegrass Band was the predecessor to Nothin' Fancy formed in 1985. It was formed to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in [[Crimora, Virginia]].<ref name=belleville /> In 1986 the group won the Virginia Folk Music Society State Bluegrass Band Championship.<ref name="samhillbands.com">[http://www.samhillbands.com/bands/eastcoast/index.shtml "Biography: East Coast Bluegrass Band"] Sam Hill Entertainment.</ref> After winning the contest, the band continued to play together at local functions.   The members of the band developed some original material, but remained true to the traditional style of the great [[bluegrass band]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name="samhillbands.com"/> Nothin' Fancy was formed in 1994. Mike Andes and Mitchell Davis joined forces with Gary Farris on guitar, Tony Shorter on bass, and Guy Carawan on fiddle to play the same East Coast Bluegrass Championship in September 1994 that East Coast Bluegrass Band had once played almost a decade earlier. Nothin' Fancy released their first project "Bluegrass in a Plain Brown Wrapper" shortly afterwards.

Nothin' Fancy and East Coast Bluegrass Band continued to coexist until 2000 when East Coast Bluegrass Band's members drifted apart and had to reorganize.

=== Notable Changes ===
Chris Sexton, who had appeared with Nothin' Fancy for their first-place victory in the band competition at the Maury River Fiddler's Convention in 1998 and recorded as a guest fiddler on the band's second and third releases ("Earn Your Ticket" and "Field of Dreams," respectively), officially became the newest member of Nothin' Fancy in 2000.  The fourth project, ''Now and Then'' is the first album to feature the five-piece group as it is today.

Shorter departed from the group in 2005, and was replaced by Eli Johnston of [[Branson, MO]].  Nothin' Fancy released "Album No.&nbsp;7" under Pinecastle with Johnston and featured him as the lead vocal on the song "Tupelo County Jail," but Johnston only stayed with the group for 13 months.  Citing artistic differences, he left the group and joined the band Pine Mountain Railroad.  Nothin' Fancy's members called Shorter back into service in time for the 6th Annual Nothin' Fancy Bluegrass Festival.  Shorter, who at the time was playing bass for country star [[Keith Bryant]], happily agreed and the band was re-united with its original cast and has stayed as such since.

Gary Farris, the guitar player, also departed the group in July 2012 and was replaced by Justin Tomlin.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/justin-tomlin-to-nothin-fancy/ "Justin Tomlin to Nothin’ Fancy"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> Tomlin left in March 2014, and Jesse Smathers joined the group in his place.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/jesse-smathers-to-nothin-fancy "Jesse Smathers to Nothin Fancy"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> In June 2015, Jesse Smathers departed the group and was replaced by guitar and dobro player, Caleb Cox.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/jesse-smathers-to-lonesome-river-band "Jesse Smathers to Lonesome River Band"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> A month later, the band signed a recording contract with Mountain Fever Records and released their first project for the label "By Any Other Name" in August 2015.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/nothin-fancy-to-mountain-fever "Nothin’ Fancy to Mountain Fever"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>

In 2019, founding member Mitchell Davis announced that he would be leaving the band. Following his departure, the band announced in March of that year that it had signed on Jacob Flick to take up Davis' role on the banjo.<ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/jacob-flick-to-nothin-fancy "Jacob Flick to Nothin’ Fancy"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>

In June 2021, it was announced that Jacobe "Jake" Lauzon would be joining the band to play guitar and provide vocals. Jake, originally from Ontario, Canada, was a welcome addition to the group, having been was recognized as the Bluegrass Guitar Player of the Year in 2018 and 2019 at the Central Canadian Bluegrass Awards.<ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/jake-lauzon-to-nothin-fancy-on-guitar/ "Jake Lauzon to Nothin’ Fancy"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>

In September 2022, it was announced that Jake Lauzon would be departing from the band to pursue new musical interests after playing one final set at the 20th Nothin' Fancy Festival.

In December 2022, the band announced that it had found its new guitar player, Curt Gausman. Curt, who got his bluegrass start in the 1980s, was part of Hobbs and Partners, which was led by Arnold Hobbs. The group also included John Paganoni, John’s son Chris (who filled in as a substitute with Nothin’ Fancy on more than one occasion), and Mark Delaney. From his work with Hobbs, he later formed the Hazel River Band, which he led through 1996 and recorded two albums with the Hay Holler label. <ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/curt-gausman-to-nothin-fancy/ "Curt Gausman to Nothin’ Fancy"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>

== Recordings ==

East Coast Bluegrass Band released four self-produced albums.  They then contracted [[Tim Austin]] of [[Doobie Shea Records|Doobie Shea Studios]] to produce and record the project. Recording began in February 1996. Later that spring, lightning struck and destroyed the studio and all the recorded sessions. Once it was up and running again they were one of the first acts to record in the new studio.<ref name="samhillbands.com"/> After four albums, thirteen years, and hundreds of performances, the band released their first nationally distributed recording project, ''Life's Mysteries'' on [[Copper Creek Records]].

The group, now appearing as Nothin' Fancy, was approached by [[Pinecastle Records]] and signed to the label in 2002.  They recorded their fifth project, "Once Upon a Road" with the title song written for the band by [[Tom T. Hall]] and his wife Dixie.  "Once Upon a Road" rose to number 10 on the Bluegrass Charts as posted by [[Bluegrass Unlimited]].  Their bluegrass gospel song "When the Angels Take My Hand" rose to the Number 1 spot on the Bluegrass Gospel charts as posted by (the now-defunct) ''Bluegrass Now'' magazine.  The album also earned them a showcase at the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] (IBMA) Convention in October 2002 and a nomination for the [[International Bluegrass Music Awards|IBMA]] Emerging Artist of the Year Award.

Their sixth album, "Reflections," was a much more personal album, with Andes penning 10 of the 13 songs.  It featured the novelty single "I Met My Baby in the Porta-John Line" as a bonus track, also by Andes.  "Reflections" was not as commercially successful as "Once Upon a Road," but it was from these two albums and the performances from this period that Nothin' Fancy had found its highly unique voice, which paid homage to bands such as the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] and the [[Seldom Scene]].  The late [[Charlie Waller (American musician)|Charlie Waller]], a founding member of the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] who went on to lead that group until his death in 2004, met with Andes at the [http://www.spbgma.com/ Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America] annual convention and learned the song "Heaven Got an Angel" from Andes (that was recorded originally on "Field of Dreams") and recorded it on the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] album "Cryin' in the Chapel."

Their eighth album, ''Lord Bless This House'', the first all-gospel recording for the group, was officially released January 27, 2009 through [http://www.pinecastle.com/ Pinecastle].  Co-produced by Grammy-nominated bluegrass artist [[Rhonda Vincent]] and her brother Darrin Vincent (of Dailey and Vincent fame) with guest appearances from the both of them, it is frequently played on [[Sirius XM]] Radio's [[Bluegrass Junction]] station, along with other selections from their discography.

''Undeniable'' is the group's 16th studio recording, released in 2019 to celebrate their 25th year together. The album includes all-original songwriting by Mike Andes, Caleb Cox, and Chris Sexton. It features Mike Andes (mandolin, lead/harmony vocals), Chris Sexton (fiddle, harmony vocals), Caleb Cox (guitar, lead/harmony vocals), James Cox (bass), and Jacob Flick (banjo). Cello, viola, and string arrangements on “Here’s To My Life” were provided by Chris Sexton. The album was recorded, mixed, and mastered at Mountain Fever Studios in [[Willis, Floyd County, Virginia|Willis, Virginia]] and released by [[Mountain Fever Records]].

== Performance ==

East Coast Bluegrass Band paid their dues at lawn parties and bars in and around the [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] area and the [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] area for many years.  In years since, the band, as Nothin' Fancy, has played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] at the historic [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]],<ref>[http://www.bluegrassworks.com/profile.php?profileID=31 Bluegrass Works] interview "Nothin' Fancy" with Loretta Sawyer, 03/25/2004.</ref> and with the "Bluegrass Series with [[Rhonda Vincent]] & Nothin' Fancy".<ref>[http://nemr.net/~rhondav/ Official Website] Rhonda Vincent.</ref> They have played such other major venues as [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]], and [[The Birchmere]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].  Nothin' Fancy plays about 140 shows a year and is a staple on the bluegrass festival circuit.<ref>[http://journalstar.com/articles/2007/09/28/living/gz/performances/doc46fb0ee5f118e173797113.txt Lincoln Journal Star] "Members of Nothin' Fancy tell bluegrass listeners to expect something different" by L. Kent Wolgamott, September 28, 2007.</ref> The band has been known to take fans on bus trips to festivals and accompanying them on bluegrass cruises aboard the [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and [[Carnival]] cruises.<ref>[http://bluegrasscountry.org/programs/aotm/nothin-fancy/ Bluegrass Country] profile "October 2004: Nothin' Fancy".</ref> Nothin' Fancy performed in June 2010 at the Tottenhan Bluegrass Festival in [[Ontario, Canada]], and the band toured as part of the 2012 Bluegrass Sundays Winter Concert series organized by the Northern Bluegrass Committee in Scarborough, Ontario.<ref>"Bluegrass Sundays" concert program, Northern Bluegrass Committee, 2012</ref>

== Musical style and sound ==
The band seeks to remain "true to the traditional sounds of the great bluegrass bands of the 1940s and '50s",<ref name="samhillbands.com"/> while also performing and recording original songs by their prolific songwriter, lead singer Mike Andes.  Classic bluegrass material draws from [[Bill Monroe]], [[Ralph Stanley]], the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]], and the [[Seldom Scene]]; but song selection ranges from original material to gospel classics to covers of pop artists such as [[Bob Seger]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].

In live performance Nothin' Fancy has been noted for its strong vocals, four-part arrangements, and its high-energy shows well-seasoned with humor.  The quintet's early years saw the band gathering around one microphone, employing a shell-game choreography for solos and back-up which keeps the show visually active as well as aurally pleasing, although the most recent configuration is more traditional with individual microphones for instruments and vocals. Andes' clear singing style is attributed to the unique stylings of [[Charlie Waller (American musician)|Charlie Waller]], whose earthy bass-baritone voice sang with clear enunciation.  Farris sings a bold tenor harmony remarkable for its projection; his powerful delivery has been likened to the late [[John Duffey]] of the [[Seldom Scene]].  Shorter occasionally sings baritone harmonies an octave higher, while Davis sings bass vocals, more on gospel songs. In later recordings, Davis gave up singing bass and allowed Sexton to sing bass on gospel songs

==Nothin' Fancy Bluegrass Festival==
In 2001, a Rockbridge County entrepreneur, Morris O'Shields, created a bluegrass festival at the Glen Maury Park, the site of the Maury River Fiddler's Convention where Nothin' Fancy won its victory three years before.  The festival was named for Nothin' Fancy, who have served as the host act in years since.<ref>[http://www.rockbridgeweekly.com/rw_article.php?ndx=9737 Rockbridge Weekly] "Virginia Based Bluegrass Band Nothin' Fancy Garners National Music Award".</ref>  Just as the band originally named itself after the first music festival in which it competed—subsequently winning the prize—it then had a music festival, whose competition it had also won, subsequently named for it.

The so-named festival has become a much-loved annual event that brings scores of bluegrass fans to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and to the little town of [[Buena Vista, VA]], where Farris calls home (and from which the band operates).  Held each year at the Glen Maury Park in [[Buena Vista, Virginia]], the [[music festival|festival]] has perennially played host to major [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[musical group|band]]s.  The 2008 [[music festival|festival]], for example, included such names as [[Rhonda Vincent]], [[Michelle Nixon]], Blue Mountain Sunrise, The Deer Creek Boys, [[The Country Gentlemen|Randy Waller & the Country Gentlemen]], Blue Moon Rising, and the [http://www.thegarywaldrepband.com/ Gary Waldrep Band].<ref>*[http://www.cybergrass.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=5313 Cybergrass] "SPBGMA Entertaining Group Of The Year Nothin' Fancy To Host Bluegrass Fest" September 10, 2008.</ref>  It has also hosted bands and artists such as [[IIIrd Tyme Out]], the [http://www.lonesomeriverband.com/ Lonesome River Band], [[Missy Raines]], [[Marty Raybon]], [[The Dillards]], the [[Lewis Family]], [http://www.goldwingexpress.net/ Goldwing Express], [http://www.larrystephensonband.com/ Larry Stephenson], [http://www.marknewtonband.com/ Mark Newton], [[Doyle Lawson]], and [http://www.charliesizemoreband.com/ Charlie Sizemore].

The project doubles as the group's first release for the Columbia label, which also released ''Blonde on Blonde''. They announced their addition to the roster with an impromptu performance of "[[Rainy Day Women ♯12 & 35|Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]" from the Dylan album. In support of the album release, Secor states:

<blockquote>Fifty years is a long time for a place like Nashville, Tennessee. Time rolls on slowly around here like flotsam and jetsam in the muddy [[Cumberland River]].

=== ''Volunteer'' (2018) ===
Old Crow Medicine Show released their sixth studio album, ''Volunteer'', through Columbia Nashville on April 20, 2018—coinciding with their 20th anniversary as a group. The album was recorded at Nashville's "historic" RCA Studio A with Americana "super-producer" [[Dave Cobb]], known for his work with [[Jason Isbell]] and [[Chris Stapleton]].

"Look Away" is a "Rolling Stones-inspired tribute to the history of the American South," while "A World Away" is an "upbeat homage to refugees." "Dixie Avenue" is a wistful tribute to the place in Virginia where Secor and Fuqua first "fell in love with music." The closing song "Whirlwind" is a "bittersweet love song that could easily describe Old Crow Medicine's rise to prominence from the ground up."<ref name=":3" />

The lead single "Flicker & Shine" was released January 19, 2018.<ref name=":3" />

The band released their seventh studio album, ''[[Paint This Town]]'' on April 22, 2022.

===Influences===

An early Secor influence was [[John Hartford]] who performed for his first grade class in [[Missouri]], making him want "to play the banjo after that;"<ref name=Premo group=i>{{cite news|last=Premo|first=Cole|title=Curiocity Interview: Ketch Secor Of 'Old Crow Medicine Show'|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/curiocity-interview-ketch-secor-of-old-crow-medicine-show/|access-date=13 November 2012|newspaper=CBS Minnesota|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> and the first song he ever learned to play was [[Tom Paxton]]'s "[[Ramblin' Boy]]".<ref name=Goodman />{{rp|6}} [[Guns N' Roses]] was Fuqua's "first influence": when they released ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), while he was in seventh grade, he knew he wanted to be a musician.

Naming his major influences, Secor states: "Certainly, Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan... Bob Dylan. More than anything else. More than any book or song or story or play. The work and the recorded work of Bob Dylan. It's the most profound influence on me. And then the other people that really influenced me, tend to be the same people who influenced Bob Dylan."<ref name=Premo group=i/> Fuqua concurs on Dylan's influence:

{{blockquote|He's a link to Woody Guthrie, who's a link to an even earlier form of American music history. He's... a great doorway for all sorts of artists because he's not just folk or just rock ... I think bands like us, Mumford and Sons, and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are sort of doing what he has done before, in that we take our own experiences and observations and put them into songs made of traditional, American roots form. That form is still a great vehicle for songs, whether the song is about love, the Iraq War or anything else.<ref name=Dearmore group=i/>}}

The Dylan doorway led to the first recordings of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], the [[Jim Kweskin|Jim Kweskin Jug Band]], [[Canned Heat]], [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], Dylan and [[The Band]] in the basement, and the [[Grateful Dead]].<ref name=Mazor2004 />

|quote=It takes a lot to figure out how to keep one foot in old-time and one foot in all time. It's a bit of a dance to be rooted and modern at the same time.

Early on the group didn't perform songs they'd written, instead drawing on a storehouse of pre-war [[jug band]], string band, [[minstrel show]], blues, and folk fare. As with other young groups in the genre, driven by all that punk music energy, they played this old material "fast and hard".<ref name=Himes>{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|title=That Old-Time Feeling: The new wave of string bands evolves|url=http://citypaper.com/music/that-old-time-feeling-1.1371425|access-date=13 September 2012|newspaper=Baltimore City Paper|date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> When they started writing original material they distinguished themselves "from the crowded field of New Wave string bands as genuine stars. And both groups have done it by writing new songs more ambitious than mere rewrites of old [[Hillbilly music|hillbilly]] and blues numbers."<ref name=Himes /> Songs they write often have a socially conscious theme, such as  "I Hear Them All", "Ways Of Man", "Ain't It Enough", and "Levi".

Secor admits to developing "the habit of writing what he calls 'stolen melody songs'"—in much the same way he'd created "Wagon Wheel", carrying on in the folk tradition—"like when he penned fresh, war tax-themed lyrics to a tune that had already passed through other wholesale re-writes during its descent from old-time [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[balladry]]."<ref name="Hight" /> Dave Rawlings states: "I've always thought that a really important thing that the Old Crow Medicine Show brought to the table was new songs—some reinterpreted old ones, some really nicely written and brand new—with the old flavor, but also with that vitality."<ref name=Mazor>{{cite news|last=Mazor|first=Barry|title=Renegades on the Road|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574320383262997704 |access-date=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>

| quote = My relationship with the band is a bit like a Saturn 5 rocket.  For whatever reason, I need to leave sometimes. I achieve an escape vector from the gravitational pull of Old Crow, then I’m off into space, orbiting, floating in zero gravity in my capsule.

The '''Osborne Brothers''', [[Sonny Osborne|Sonny]] (October 29, 1937 – October 24, 2021) and [[Bobby Osborne|Bobby]] (December 7, 1931 – June 27, 2023), were an influential and popular [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] act during the 1960s and 1970s and until Sonny retired in 2005.<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=300}}</ref> They are probably best known for their No.&nbsp;33 1967 country hit song, "[[Rocky Top]]", written by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]] and named after a [[Tennessee]] location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=35.56389&lon=-83.71389&datum=nad27&zoom=4|title=Rocky Top, NC - N35.56389° W83.71389°|website=Topoquest.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

==Biography==
The Osbornes were born in [[Roark, Kentucky]], on Jack's Creek, but they moved to [[Hyden, Kentucky|Hyden]], after their house burned down. They then moved near [[Dayton, Ohio]], where they grew up and performed as entertainers in southwestern Ohio.<ref name=t237>Tribe 2006, p.&nbsp;237.</ref> In 1952, during the [[Korean War]], Bobby was drafted and served in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Sonny went to work with the "Father of Bluegrass Music" [[Bill Monroe]]. Following Bobby's discharge, the Osbornes teamed up with [[Jimmy Martin]], performing at radio stations WROL in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and [[WJR]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=t238>Tribe 2006, p.&nbsp;238.</ref><ref name=o2>Osborne 1964, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> At their only session together, on November 16, 1954, the Osbornes and Martin recorded six songs for RCA Victor.<ref>Booklet, Bear Family Records BCD 15705</ref> In late 1955, the Osbornes left Martin and moved to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], where they performed on [[WWVA Jamboree]] until Christmas, together with Charlie Bailey.<ref name=r155>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;155.</ref> They returned to Dayton in early 1956 playing the local clubs with guitarist Enos Johnson. When Johnson left, the Osbornes added guitarist [[Red Allen (bluegrass)|Red Allen]] and fiddler Art Stamper to form a new group.

The Osborne Brothers and Red Allen (under the pseudonym Stanley Alpine) recorded for Gateway Records in February or March 1956 cutting eight instrumentals. In the spring of 1956, Tommy Sutton, a local disc jockey, helped the Osborne Brothers get a recording contract with [[MGM Records]].<ref name=g67>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;67.</ref> The new group, with the Osbornes on banjo and mandolin, Allen on guitar, Ernie Newton on bass, Tommy Jackson and Art Stamper on fiddles, made their MGM recording debut on July 1, 1956.<ref name="ReferenceA">Booklet, Bear Family Records BCD 15598</ref> Their first released 45 RPM single for MGM containing "Ruby Are You Mad" became a huge success and led to the Osbornes being signed on as regular members of the WWVA Jamboree in October 1956.<ref name=r155/><ref name=g68>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;68.</ref> The "Jamboree version" of the group comprised Ricky Russell on dobro, Johnny Dacus on fiddle and Ray Anderson on bass. "Ruby Are You Mad" marks the first time twin banjos were used on a bluegrass recording.<ref name=g68/> On October 17, 1957, at their third session for MGM, the Osbornes, always experimenting with their sound, added a dobro and drums, also for the first time on a bluegrass recording. In April 1958, Red Allen, who was the last musician to receive billing next to the Osborne Brothers, left the group.<ref name=g69>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;69.</ref>

Upon their breaking into the bluegrass scene, the Osborne Brothers quickly became known for their virtuoso instrumentation and tight, melodic vocal harmonies. They first made the country chart in 1958 with "Once More", performing as a trio with [[Red Allen (bluegrass)|Red Allen]]. The song featured a novel inverted stacked harmony. Bobby sang the lead line highest, with Sonny singing baritone, and the third singer (Red Allen) singing tenor as the lowest part. This made Bobby's distinctive voice the lead, and the third voice was somewhat interchangeable. As a result, they could hire others guitarist and singers without changing the overall sound. The "high lead" vocal trio became their signature, and they used to great effect in the country market with songs like "Blame Me", "Sweethearts Again", and a remake of the Carter Family's "Fair and Tender Ladies".

During the 1960s, the Osbornes caused minor controversy among Bluegrass music purists by incorporating electronic and percussion instruments in their live acts and studio work. In 1960 they became the first bluegrass group to play on a college campus, performing at Antioch College.<ref name=wd243>Wolff, Duane 2000, p.&nbsp;243.</ref> In 1963 they signed with [[Decca Records]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> On August 8, 1964, the Osborne Brothers were inducted as members of the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/MeetTheOpry/Members.aspx?id=116|title=Grand Ole Opry: Members|website=Opry.com|access-date=August 8, 2021|archive-date=September 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911013352/http://www.opry.com/MeetTheOpry/Members.aspx?id=116|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Osborne Brothers recorded their hit “Rocky Top” in November 1967. Released on December 25, 1967, it sold 85,000 copies in only two weeks,<ref name="l30">Ledgin (2004), p. 30</ref> and was named an official Tennessee [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tn.gov/main/article/state-songs |title=State Songs |publisher=Tennessee State Government |access-date=2017-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626114840/http://www.tn.gov/main/article/state-songs |archive-date=2015-06-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1973 the Osborne Brothers became the first bluegrass group to perform at the White House.<ref name=l30/>

In 1994, The Osborne Brothers were inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]]'s Hall of Honor.

==Hits==
Their song "Ruby Are You Mad" came in 1956 after signing with MGM Records (1956) and began a string of hits through 1986. Among them were "Once More" (1958), "Up This Hill & Down" (1965), "Making Plans" (1965), "Rocky Top" (1967), "Tennessee Hound Dog" (1969), and "Midnight Flyer" (1972). The Osborne Brothers' final chart appearance came in late 1986 with a new version of "Rocky Top".

==Later years and deaths==
Bobby continued to perform with his band Rocky Top X-press, which includes two of his three sons. They performed May 31, 2013, at the rededication marking new ownership of The Gatlinburg Inn, where Boudleaux and Felice Bryant wrote "Rocky Top," and the couple's sons, Dane and Del Bryant, were on hand. Bobby died in 2023.

Sonny retired in 2005 and died in 2021.

She began performing in her teenaged years before signing her first recording contract with [[MCA Records]]' Nashville division in 1985. While her first few releases were unsuccessful, she broke through by decade's end with a cover of [[George Jones]]'s "[[If My Heart Had Windows (song)|If My Heart Had Windows]]". Loveless issued five albums on MCA before moving to [[Epic Records]] in 1993, where she released nine more albums. Four of her albums{{mdash}}''[[Honky Tonk Angel (Patty Loveless album)|Honky Tonk Angel]]'', ''[[Only What I Feel]]'', ''[[When Fallen Angels Fly]]'', and ''[[The Trouble with the Truth (album)|The Trouble with the Truth]]''{{mdash}}are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] in the United States. Loveless has charted 44 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including five which reached number one: "[[Timber, I'm Falling in Love]]", "[[Chains (Patty Loveless song)|Chains]]", "[[Blame It on Your Heart]]", "[[You Can Feel Bad]]", and "[[Lonely Too Long]]".

Loveless's music is defined by a mix of sounds, including [[neotraditional country]], [[country pop]], and [[bluegrass music]], with her singing voice garnering favorable comparisons to [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Emmylou Harris]]. Recurring songwriters whose work she has recorded include [[Matraca Berg]], [[Kostas (songwriter)|Kostas]], [[Jim Lauderdale]], and [[Steve Earle]]. She has collaborated with [[Vince Gill]], [[George Jones]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]], among others. Nearly all of her albums were produced by her husband, [[Emory Gordy Jr.]] Although she largely retired from performing in 2009, Loveless has sporadically contributed to other artists' works in subsequent years. She has won five awards from the [[Country Music Association]], two from the [[Academy of Country Music]], and two [[Grammy Awards]]. 

Loveless was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] on October 22, 2023.

===2000–2005: transition to bluegrass and final years with Epic===
Loveless returned in 2000 with the studio project ''[[Strong Heart (album)|Strong Heart]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> On recording the album, she said she wanted to find songs that appealed to young adults. Steve Earle contributed a harmonica part on the track "You're So Cool".<ref name="manitowoc"/> It spawned two top-20 country singles with "[[That's the Kind of Mood I'm In]]" and "[[The Last Thing on My Mind (Patty Loveless song)|The Last Thing on My Mind]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> Despite these chart entries, the album was commercially unsuccessful, with Steve Huey of AllMusic attributing its failure to a more country pop sound than the preceding albums.<ref name="allmusic"/> Alanna Nash shared a similar opinion in a review for ''Entertainment Weekly'', although she praised the track "My Heart Will Never Pass This Way Again" for the inclusion of [[fiddle]] music.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/2000/09/01/music-review-strong-heart/ | title=''Strong Heart'' review | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | work=September 1, 2000 | access-date=September 29, 2022 | author=Alanna Nash}}</ref> Country Standard Time reviewer Eli Messinger was more mixed toward the project, considering it inferior to ''Long Stretch of Lonesome'' while noting the inclusion of [[Jimmy Hall]] and [[Travis Tritt]] on various tracks.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2183 | title=''Strong Heart'' review | publisher=Country Standard Time | access-date=September 29, 2022 | author=Eli Messinger}}</ref>

She released a pair of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] albums between 2001 and 2002. The first of these was ''[[Mountain Soul]]'', which consisted of original content and cover songs. Loveless said she had wanted to do an acoustic bluegrass album since 1992 when she met [[Ralph Stanley]]. Epic Records executives agreed to let her release the project after noticing positive fan reactions whenever she sang bluegrass songs in concert. Another factor in this decision was the contemporary success of bluegrass-influenced albums such as the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' and the works of [[Nickel Creek]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/481105908/ | title=Patty Loveless goes home again with latest, the acoustic 'Mountain Soul' | work=Livingston County Daily Press and Argus | date=July 5, 2001 | access-date=September 29, 2022 | pages=3C}}</ref> The album included guest vocals from [[Earl Scruggs]] and [[Ricky Skaggs]], along with covers of songs originally recorded by [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Darrell Scott]].

Loveless's next album was 2003's ''[[On Your Way Home]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> Loveless later said that she and Emory Gordy wanted to mix the "traditional" bluegrass feel of ''Mountain Soul'' with more contemporary instruments such as drums and electric guitar.

The 2005 release ''[[Dreamin' My Dreams (Patty Loveless album)|Dreamin' My Dreams]]'' was Loveless's last release for Epic before the label closed its Nashville branch.

===2008–present: continued Bluegrass work and semi-retirement===
In 2006, Loveless appeared on rock singer [[Bob Seger]]'s ''[[Face the Promise]]'' as a duet partner on the track "The Answer's in the Question". [[David N. Cole]], Seger's [[audio engineer]], had recommended Loveless as a duet partner because he thought the song should be recorded as a duet. Seger was initially unsure if Loveless would approve, but the two agreed after realizing they were fans of each other's music.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/363934218 | title=Seger, track by track | work=[[Detroit Free Press]] | date=September 12, 2006 | access-date=September 29, 2022 | author=Brian McCollum | pages=1C, 2C}}</ref> She then took a hiatus from recording, due in part to Epic closing its Nashville branch.

A year later, Loveless released her last studio album to date called ''[[Mountain Soul II]]''. This was a follow-up to the original ''Mountain Soul'' project. Like its predecessor, it featured influences of acoustic and bluegrass music. Vince Gill, [[Del McCoury]], and Emmylou Harris were among the contributing vocalists, the latter doing so on a cover of her own "Diamond in My Crown". Loveless also included a number of traditional Christian songs such as "Children of Abraham", which she sang ''[[a cappella]]''.<ref name="craig">{{cite web | url=https://www.cmt.com/news/ypfe91/patty-loveless-finds-her-inner-rhythm-on-mountain-soul-ii | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220930005937/https://www.cmt.com/news/ypfe91/patty-loveless-finds-her-inner-rhythm-on-mountain-soul-ii | url-status=dead | archive-date=September 30, 2022 | title=Patty Loveless finds her inner rhythm on ''Mountain Soul II'' | publisher=CMT | date=October 1, 2009 | access-date=September 29, 2022 | author=Craig Shelburne}}</ref> Loveless chose to include Christian material on the project as she had previously sung "[[Amazing Grace]]" with Ralph Stanley and Emmylou Harris while on tour with them.<ref name="craig"/> The album's lead single was a cover of Harlan Howard's "[[Busted (Harlan Howard song)|Busted]]".

Although she largely retired from performing in 2009, Loveless has sporadically contributed to other artists' albums. She provided vocals to the track "Dear Diamond" on [[Miranda Lambert]]'s 2010 album ''[[Four the Record]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/four-the-record-mw0002186259 | title=''Four the Record'' | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 29, 2022 | author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]}}</ref> The same year, she joined with [[Danica Patrick]], [[Caitlyn Jenner]], and [[Michael Strahan]] in a program started by [[NASCAR]] titled Drive, which was done to raise awareness of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].

==Musical style==
The editors of ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'' describe Loveless as having a "straight-from-the-heart, strong yet vulnerable vocal style", which they compared favorably to Loretta Lynn and [[Kitty Wells]]. The same entry noted that Loveless had commercial success with both upbeat songs and ballads, and stated that she "may not be one of the more flashy personalities around; nevertheless, the songs she chooses to sing and the way she chooses to sing them are some of the best of what modern 'traditional' country music is all about."<ref name="stambler"/> Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that she "rose to stardom thanks to her blend of [[honky-tonk]] and [[country rock]], not to mention a plaintive, emotional ballad style...but most critics agreed that she truly came into her own as an artist when she moved to Epic in the early '90s."<ref name="allmusic"/> According to ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', she attributed her vocal tone to her upbringing in areas of Kentucky known for bluegrass music.<ref name="virgin"/>

In a review of ''Up Against My Heart'', Alanna Nash described Loveless as having a "wild-and-wounded voice". She also wrote that "[l]ike neo-traditionalist Emmylou Harris, she isn't afraid of a sassy country rock beat or progressive lyrics that paint her as a woman who knows what she wants from love".<ref name="up against">{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/1991/09/13/against-my-heart/ | title=''Up Against My Heart'' review | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=September 13, 1991 | access-date=September 29, 2022}}</ref> Nash also noted that Loveless had yet to win any industry awards at the time of the album's release, stating that "her lack of both flamboyance and any desire to play Nashville politics" may have been a factor.<ref name="up against"/> Carole L.

The same article also described "The Lonely Side of Love", "Hurt Me Bad (In a Real Good Way)", and "Can't Stop Myself from Loving You" as more traditional in style than "rock-oriented" material like "Jealous Bone" or "Chains".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/223718939/ | title=A '90s honky-tonk angel | work=The Courier-News | date=July 29, 1993 | access-date=September 29, 2022 | pages=D5}}</ref>

Nash described Gordy's production style as "lean but muscular".<ref name="up against"/>  Loveless told ''CMA Close Up'' in 1996 that production sessions usually began with Gordy recording just her vocals and an acoustic guitar track to determine her vocal tone for each track before adding in other instruments.<ref name="stambler"/> Remz stated in a review of ''Long Stretch of Lonesome'' that Gordy "knows just what to do with his wife's voice{{emdash}}let it rip, but he doesn't overmilk it either."<ref name="remz lonesome">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2185 | title=''Long Stretch of Lonesome'' | publisher=Country Standard Time | access-date=September 29, 2022 | author=Jeffrey B. Remz}}</ref> Loveless told ''The Los Angeles Times'' in 1995 that she looks for songs with "realism" in the lyrics.<ref name="heights"/> She also stated that she did not like recording songs about relationships if they cast men in a negative light; she said she initially rejected "You Don't Even Know Who I Am" for this reason until she realized the song's second verse showed the failing relationship from the male's perspective, as well.<ref name="heights"/> As Loveless almost never wrote songs, she often enlisted Gordy's help in song selection and arrangement.<ref name="gordy"/>

==Legacy==
Because of her prolificacy in the 1990s, Loveless has been cited by several publications as having an influence on the subsequent generations of country music. In 2017, [[Taste of Country]] ranked her the 29th "most powerful woman" in country music, noting the critical success of the ''Mountain Soul'' albums. In the same article, [[Lauren Lucas]] stated that ''The Trouble with the Truth'' was a "huge influence" on her.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://tasteofcountry.com/patty-loveless-powerful-female-country-singers/ | title=Patty Loveless: Country's Most Powerful Women of All Time | publisher=[[Taste of Country]] | date=September 2, 2017 | access-date=November 22, 2022}}</ref> Carly Pearce has also cited Loveless as a career influence.

[[File:Emory Gordy Jr.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Loveless has been married to [[Emory Gordy Jr.]] since 1989.|alt=Emory Gordy Jr. playing an upright bass]]
Loveless's first marriage was to Terry Lovelace, drummer for the Wilburn Brothers, in 1973. After marrying him, she altered the spelling of her surname to Loveless. According to the ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', this change came about because she thought it would help to keep her from being mistaken for pornographic actress [[Linda Lovelace]].<ref name="virgin"/> Loveless previously confirmed as such in a 1990 interview with the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/831705201/ | title=Honky-tonk angel flying high | work=Richmond Times-Dispatch | date=March 23, 1990 | access-date=October 10, 2022 | pages=D1, D3}}</ref> She divorced Terry Lovelace in 1986.<ref name="copd"/><ref name="virgin"/> Her second marriage was to Emory Gordy Jr. in February 1989.

== Various acts ==
[[File:PeterRowanTonyRice.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Rowan (left) performing with [[Tony Rice]] in 2008]]
'''Peter Rowan Bluegrass Band'''
 
Rowan's career in bluegrass started in 1964 as part of Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. Bluegrass legend Bill Monroe thought that Rowan sounded like himself. “When the two harmonized together, they were said to reach ‘heavenly heights.’"<ref name="Peter Rowan Discography">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peter-rowan.com/biography.html|title=Peter Rowan Discography|website=www.peter-rowan.com|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref> Rowan co-wrote ‘Walls Of Time’ with Monroe, which has since become a bluegrass standard. Peter Rowan's Bluegrass Band consists of Blaine Sprouse on fiddle, Christopher Henry on mandolin, Paul Knight on bass, Patrick Sauber on banjo, Jamie Oldaker on drums. The band plays Rowan's original tunes along with Bill Monroe and Carter Family classics. 

'''Peter Rowan's Big Twang Theory'''

Rowan leads Big Twang Theory with musicians Mike Witcher on dobro, Paul Knight on bass, [[Nina Gerber]] on electric guitar, and Rowan's son Michael Carter Rowan on guitar and vocals. Drummers Larry Attamanuik and Ken Owen and banjo player Jeff Mosier also appear with Rowan's Big Twang Theory when their schedules permit. "I have always wanted a band that was rooted in bluegrass, but could add the twang of Hank Williams, Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly. They all absorbed Bill Monroe's bluegrass into honky-tonk and rockabilly. I grew up dancing to that music.”<ref name="Peter Rowan Discography"/> – Peter Rowan.

'''Peter Rowan's Twang an' Groove'''

Twang an’ Groove is a blend of rhythm and blues, reggae, and bluegrass music. The band features Rowan on electric guitar and vocals, Blaine Sprouse on fiddle, Mike Morgan on bass, and virtuoso drummer, Jamie Oldaker.
<ref name="Peter Rowan Discography"/>

'''Peter Rowan & Crucial Reggae'''

This outfit is Rowan's nod to reggae music. Rowan's diversity in musical ability ventures beyond his bluegrass roots with Crucial Reggae to bring some of Rowan's most soulful original music to light. He is accompanied by reggae greats Tony Chin and Fully Fullwood, on guitar and bass respectively. Crucial Reggae is sometimes accompanied by other musicians to form an either five or six-piece band. They become a nine-piece band when they are joined by the Burning Spear horn section.

'''The Free Mexican Airforce'''

The Free Mexican Airforce features Rowan and some of his most beloved songs: "Come Back to Old Santa Fe", "Ride the Wild Mustang", "Midnight Moonlight", and "Free Mexican Airforce". This four-piece often features Cindy Cashdollar on pedal steel guitar along with players on bass and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peter-rowan.com/biography.html|title=Peter Rowan Discography|website=www.peter-rowan.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>

==History==
{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}
The band was originally formed in 2001, and was composed of vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Todd Sheaffer, violinist/vocalist Tim Carbone, mandolinist John Skehan, multi-instrumentalist Andy Goessling, drummer/vocalist Carey Harmon, and bassist Dave Von Dollen. Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and [[New Jersey]] rock outfit [[Kings in Disguise]]. When rehearsals of original music, mostly written by Sheaffer, began occurring, the band soon realized that something musically unique was happening. After three weeks of rehearsing, they went into a local recording studio to track a five-song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |title=Railroad Earth &#124; Pollstar - the Concert Hotwire |access-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810131640/http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and ''[[The Black Bear Sessions]]'' was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride. That album contains what are still some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including "Seven Story Mountain," "Head" and, of course, "Railroad Earth."

The band was approached by [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] after seeing their performance at Telluride. Right after their show, Railroad Earth was offered a record deal on the spot.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In June 2002, Railroad Earth released its follow-up album on Sugar Hill titled ''[[Bird in a House]]'', featuring such enduring songs as "Like A Buddha," "Mighty River," and the album's title track. Throughout that year Railroad Earth's touring schedule increased dramatically and their growing fanbase began to emerge as something tangible to promoters, radio stations and other media. They were garnering raves for their unique sound and exciting live shows and had become a staple act on the line-up of any roots, folk or [[jam-band]] festival. Their fans, who were now calling themselves "Hobos," began to grow quickly in number, and the venues were getting larger along with them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In late March 2003, Dave Von Dollen was replaced by Atlanta-based bassist Johnny Grubb. The following year, the band released its third studio effort, ''[[The Good Life (Railroad Earth album)|The Good Life]]'', featuring "Storms", "Mourning Flies" and "Goat".  The band continued to tour throughout the country, and its first live album, ''[[Elko (album)|Elko]]'', was issued in late January 2006. They performed at the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] on September 15, 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://livemusicblog.com/news/2007-austin-city-limits-music-festival-lineup/|title = 2007 Austin City Limits Music Festival Lineup - LIVE music blog|newspaper = Live Music Blog|date = 10 May 2007}}</ref>

The band's fourth studio album, titled ''Amen Corner'', was released on June 10, 2008. The album features songs such as "Been Down This Road," "Hard Livin'," "[[The Forecast]]," and "[[Lovin' You]]."

On November 11, 2009, Grubb announced his departure from the band after Railroad Earth's New Year's Eve run of shows in [[Portland, Oregon]]. In February 2010, Andrew Altman of the [[Codetalkers]] and Blueground Undergrass was named as his successor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notreble.com/buzz/2010/02/12/railroad-earth-recruits-andrew-altman/|title = Railroad Earth recruits Andrew Altman|date = 12 February 2010}}</ref>

The band's self-titled, fifth album was released on Oct 12, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/railroad-earth-take-my-hand|title = Railroad Earth: Take My Hand}}</ref> The album featured new songs from Todd Sheaffer including "Jupiter and the 119" and " Too Much Information"  plus an 11-minute instrumental, written by John Skehan, "Spring-Heeled Jack." It is the second-longest studio track to date for the band.

In February 2013 Railroad Earth performed at the Jefferson Theatre at the University of Virginia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2013/02/railroad-earth-chugs-into-charlottesville|title=Railroad Earth chugs into Charlottesville|website=Cavalierdaily.com|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> and at Workplay in Birmingham, Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/02/bluegrass_jamgrass_whatever_it.html|title=Bluegrass?

On January 14, 2014, Railroad Earth released their seventh album, ''Last of the Outlaws'', to rave reviews from media and fans alike. It featured the 21-minute-long "suite" of "All That's Dead May Live Again" and "Face With a Hole" both written by Todd Sheaffer, and featured instrumental movements written by John Skehan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relix.com/reviews/detail/railroad_earth_last_of_the_outlaws|title=Railroad Earth: Last of the Outlaws - Relix Media|date=10 January 2014|website=Relix.com|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> In the tour that followed Railroad Earth headlined [[Red Rocks]] for the second time, selling out, and with the help of the Mile High Horns (arranged by Jay Rattman). The result can be seen on the DVD ''Live at Red Rocks''.

Railroad Earth backed [[Warren Haynes]] on February 3, 2015 for a taping of the PBS series ''Front and Center'' for airing in May 2015. There were also studio Haynes tracks recorded with Railroad Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/123883/Warren-Haynes-and-Railroad-Earth-Front-and-Center-TV-Taping|title=Warren Haynes & Railroad Earth Front & Center TV Taping|date=29 January 2015|website=Jambase.com|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

In May 2018, Railroad Earth released a 7" vinyl EP in collaboration with the [[John Denver]] estate called ''Railroad Earth: The John Denver Letters''. The project included lyrics penned by [[John Denver]] with music composed by Todd Sheaffer and performed by Railroad Earth. The album was released on Earth Day and a portion of proceeds went to benefit Youth Climate Strike in honor of both artists commitment to the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://liveforlivemusic.com/news/railroad-earth-john-denver-2019/|title=Railroad Earth Announces 'The John Denver Letters', Shares New Single "If You Will be My Lady" &#91;Watch&#93;|date=18 April 2019}}</ref>

The members of Railroad Earth have also released numerous solo albums. In 2009, Skehan released a duet album with mandolinist Todd Collins, performing the eighteenth-century Italian sonatas of [[Emanuele Barbella]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2009/07/28/john-skehan-and-todd-collins-perform-mandolin-duets-of-emanuele-barbella|access-date=2015-04-27|website=Jambands.com|title=John Skehan and Todd Collins perform mandolin duets of Emanuele Barbella|date=28 July 2009}}</ref> In 2010 Carbone co-founded the jamband supergroup The Contribution with Keith Moseley and Jason Hann of [[String Cheese Incident]] along with Jeff Miller and Phil Ferlino of [[New Monsoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/21822/The-Contribution-Carbone-Miller-Moseley-Hann-Ferlino|access-date=2015-04-27|title=The Contribution: Carbone, Miller, Moseley, Hann, Ferlino|website=Jambase.com}}</ref> Carbone has also produced albums by many bands, including [[Greensky Bluegrass]] and [[Great American Taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/features/2009/03/26/tim-carbone-the-producer-serving-the-song|website=Jambands.com|title=Tim Carbone: Producer Serving the Song|date=26 March 2009|access-date=2015-04-27}}</ref> In 2015 Carbone contributed to ''[[Waywords and Meansigns]]'', a collaborative project setting James Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' to music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/jam-bands-experimental-music-and-james-joyce-finnegans-wake-set-music-unabridged|title=Jam Bands, Experimental Music, and James Joyce|website=Gratefulweb.com|access-date=2015-04-27}}</ref>

Andy Goessling (born Andrew James Goessling on February 5, 1959) died of cancer on October 12, 2018, at age 59, as announced by the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://railroad.earth/news/loving-memory-our-friend-family-and-bandmate-andy-goessling|title=Railroad Earth: In Loving Memory of Our Friend, Family, and Bandmate Andy Goessling|date=18 October 2018|access-date=21 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://baileyfuneral.com/tribute/details/2537/Andrew-Goessling/obituary.html|title=In Memory of Andrew James Goessling 1959 - 2018|date=October 2018|access-date=21 October 2018}}</ref>

After a succession of special guests throughout 2019, the band has settled on a new touring ensemble featuring [[Matt Slocum (keyboardist)|Matthew D.

'''Ralph Edmund Stanley''' (February 25, 1927 – June 23, 2016) was an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artist, known for his distinctive singing and [[banjo]] playing. He began playing music in 1946, originally with his older brother [[Carter Stanley]] as part of [[The Stanley Brothers]], and most often as the leader of his band, '''The Clinch Mountain Boys'''. Ralph was also known as '''Dr. Ralph Stanley'''.

He was part of the first generation of [[bluegrass music]]ians and was inducted into both the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]].

==Biography==
[[File:Ralph Stanley - Ralph Stanley II - Ron Baker 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Stanley and son Ralph II in 2008]]
Stanley was born, grew up, and lived in rural [[Southwest Virginia]]—"in a little town called [[McClure, Virginia|McClure]] at a place called Big Spraddle Creek, just up the holler" from where he moved in 1936. Before that he lived in another part of [[Dickenson County]].<ref name="virginia-living55">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 55.</ref> The son of Lee and Lucy Smith Stanley, Ralph did not grow up around a lot of music in his home.  As he said, his "daddy didn't play an instrument, but sometimes he would sing church music... I'd hear him sing songs like '[[Man of Constant Sorrow]],' '[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]' and '[[Omie Wise]].'"<ref name="virginia-living55"/>

{{blockquote|I got my first banjo when I was a teenager.  I guess I was 15, 16 years old.  My aunt had this old banjo, and Mother bought it for me ... paid $5 for it, which back then was probably like $5,000.  [My parents] had a little store, and I remember my aunt took it out in groceries.<ref name="virginia-living55"/>}}

He learned to play the [[banjo]], [[clawhammer]] style, from his mother:

{{blockquote|She had 11 brothers and sisters, and all of them could play the five-string banjo.  She played gatherings around the neighborhood, like bean stringin's. She tuned it up for me and played this tune, "Shout Little Luly," and I tried to play it like she did.  But I think I developed my own style of the banjo.<ref name="virginia-living55"/>}}

He graduated from high school on May 2, 1945, and was inducted into the [[United States Army|Army]] on May 16, serving for "little more than a year." When he got home he immediately began performing:

{{blockquote|... my daddy and Carter picked me up from the (station), and Carter was playing with another group, Roy Sykes and the Blue Ridge Mountain Boys, and they had a personal appearance that night.  So I sung a song with Carter on the radio before I even got home.<ref name="virginia-living56">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56.</ref>}}

===Clinch Mountain Boys===
[[File:Dr. Ralph Stanley Grass Valley CA February 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stanley in 2006]]
After considering a course in "veterinary", he decided instead to join his older guitar-playing brother [[Carter Stanley]] (1925–1966) to form the Clinch Mountain Boys in 1946. Drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area, which included the unique singing style of the [[Primitive Baptist Universalist]] church and the sweet down-home family harmonies of the [[Carter Family]], the two Stanley brothers began playing on local radio stations. They first performed at [[Norton, Virginia]]'s WNVA, but did not stay long there, moving on instead to [[Bristol, Virginia]], and [[WZAP|WCYB]] to start the show ''Farm and Fun Time'', where they stayed "off and on for 12 years".<ref name="virginia-living56"/>

At first they covered "a lot of [[Bill Monroe]] music" (one of the first groups to pick up the new "bluegrass" format).<ref name=trischka>Trischka, Tony, "Ralph Stanley", ''Banjo Song Book'', Oak Publications, 1977</ref> They soon "found out that didn't pay off—we needed something of our own. So we started writing songs in 1947, 1948. I guess I wrote 20 or so banjo tunes, but Carter was a better writer than me."<ref name="virginia-living56"/> When [[Columbia Records]] signed them as The Stanley Brothers, Monroe left in protest joining [[Decca Records]]. Later, Carter went back to sing for the "Father of Bluegrass", Monroe.

Ralph Stanley gave his opinion on Bill Monroe's apparent change of heart: "He [Monroe] knew Carter would make him a good singer... Bill Monroe loved our music and loved our singing."<ref name="virginia-living56"/>

The Stanley Brothers joined [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in the late '50s, a record company which was so eclectic that it included [[James Brown]] at the time. In fact, James Brown and his band were in the studio when the Stanley Brothers recorded "[[Finger Poppin' Time]]". "James and his band were poppin' their fingers on that" according to Ralph.<ref name="virginia-living56"/>  At King Records, they "went to a more 'Stanley style', the sound that people most know today."<ref name="virginia-living56"/>

Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo act after Carter's death, from 1967 until his death in 2016.

===Solo===
After Carter died of complications of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for "a year or so",<ref name="virginia-living56"/> Ralph Stanley faced a hard decision on whether to continue performing on his own. "I was worried, I didn't know if I could do it by myself. But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of 'em, and phone calls... I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted me to go on, and he said, 'Hell yes! You might be better than both of them.'"<ref name="virginia-living567">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56-7.</ref>

He decided to go it alone, eventually reviving The Clinch Mountain Boys. [[Larry Sparks]], Roy Lee Centers, and Charlie Sizemore were among those with whom he played in the revived band. He encountered [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Keith Whitley]] arriving late to his own show, "They were about 16 or 17, and they were holding the crowd 'til we got there... They sounded just exactly like (the Stanley Brothers)."<ref name="virginia-living57">"Old-Time Man" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 57.</ref> Seeing their potential, he hired them "to give 'em a chance", though that meant a seven-member band.<ref name="virginia-living56"/> Eventually, his son, Ralph Stanley II, took over as lead singer and rhythm guitarist for The Clinch Mountain Boys.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |title=Ralph Stanley II.|website=Ralphstanleyii.com |access-date=September 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005927/http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His grandson Nathan Stanley became the last lead singer and band leader for The Clinch Mountain Boys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

===Political career===
About 1970, Ralph Stanley ran for Clerk of Court and Commissioner of Revenue in [[Dickenson County, Virginia|Dickenson County]] and said:

{{blockquote|What happened is, somebody traded me off—[[dummy candidate|they used my popularity and money to elect somebody else]].  I was done dirty.  And I'm so proud that I was done dirty, because if I had been elected ... I woulda had a job to do ... maybe woulda finally quit.  So that's one time I was done dirty and I want to thank them for it now.<ref name="virginia-living57"/>}}

===''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''===
Stanley's work was featured in the very popular 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', in which he sings the Appalachian dirge "[[O Death]]". The soundtrack's producer was [[T-Bone Burnett]]. Stanley said the following about working with Burnett:

{{blockquote|T-Bone Burnett had several auditions for that song.  He wanted it in the [[Dock Boggs]] style.  So I got my banjo and learned it the way he did it.  You see, I had recorded "O Death" three times, done it with Carter. So I went down with my banjo to Nashville and I said, "T-Bone, let me sing it the way I want to sing it," and I laid my banjo down and sung it [[a cappella]].  After two or three verses, he stopped me and said, "That's it."<ref name="virginia-living57"/>}}

With that song, Stanley won a [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002 Grammy Award]] in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Male Country Vocal Performance]]. "That put the icing on the cake for me," he said. "It put me in a different category."<ref name="virginia-living57"/>

==Musical style==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Stanley created a unique style of [[banjo]] playing, sometimes called "Stanley style". It evolved from the [[Wade Mainer]] style two-finger technique and was later influenced by the [[Scruggs style]], which is a three-finger technique. "Stanley style" is distinguished by incredibly fast "forward rolls", led by the index finger (instead of the thumb, as in Scruggs style), sometimes in the higher registers using a [[Capo (musical device)|capo]]. In "Stanley style", the rolls of the banjo are continuous, while being picked fairly close to the bridge on the banjo, giving the tone of the instrument a very crisp, articulate snap to the strings as the player plays them.

In the late 1960s, Owen and his cousin, Teddy Gentry, began playing music together. They recruited another cousin, Jeff Cook, to form a band, which they called Wildcountry. Their first public performance was at a high school talent show, which they won.

Owen's music career was put on hiatus as he earned an English degree from [[Jacksonville State University]]. He was also a member of [[Pi Kappa Phi]], Delta Epsilon Chapter. Upon his graduation, however, the three cousins moved into an apartment in [[Anniston, Alabama]], and by 1973 were pursuing a full-time music career. In 1980, the band, now called [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], were signed to a recording contract by RCA Records and quickly reached country superstardom. For the next twenty-two years, Alabama had a tremendous impact on [[country music]], attracting a younger group of listeners, crossing over into pop radio, and paving the way for groups to be successful on country radio.

Alabama released 21 gold, platinum, and multi-platinum albums, 42 singles that topped the charts at #1, and sold over 75 million records in total.  They have a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and were named the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Artist of the Decade in 1989, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s Country Group of the Century in 1999.

In May 2002, the band announced their retirement during the [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards telecast.  For the rest of 2002 and 2003, they performed throughout the country in their American Farewell Tour.  In 2005, the band was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

Owen lives on his cattle ranch outside Fort Payne. He currently serves as an at-large member of the Board of Trustees of [[Jacksonville State University]]. In 2007, he was a judge on Season 5 of the country talent show ''[[Nashville Star]]''.

Owen took over hosting duties for ''Country Gold'', the Saturday night [[classic country]] request program on [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]], beginning July 21, 2012. The show was reformatted upon Owen's arrival, switching to a pre-recorded format (the show's predecessor, ''Country Gold Saturday Night'', was originally live; requests are handled, as they had been with Owen's immediate predecessor, by an [[answering machine]]) [[voice-tracking|voicetracked]] from Owen's home, drifting to a more open-ended "traditional country" format (one that includes more 1990s songs and even some 2000s songs along with country-pop tunes more commonly associated with the [[classic hits]] format while moving away from the core songs of the classic country format) and shortening the show from five hours to four. (In protest of the change of format, previous ''Country Gold'' host Rowdy Yates relaunched his version of the show as "The Original Country Gold" through [[Compass Media Networks]] a year later.) Owen ended his run as host on April 2, 2016, with [[Terri Clark]] replacing him the following weekend.

==Musical career==
[[File:Rhiannon Giddens TFF 03.JPG|thumb|right|Giddens at [[Rudolstadt]] in 2015]]

Giddens is a 1995 alumna of the [[North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tomlinson |first=Tommy |date=2015-09-02 |title=Rhiannon Giddens & The Making of NC's Most Beautiful Voice |url=https://www.ourstate.com/rhiannon-giddens/ |access-date=2017-08-14 |website=Our State Celebrating North Carolina}}</ref> and a 2000 graduate of [[Oberlin Conservatory]] at [[Oberlin College]], where she studied opera.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Menconi |first=David |date=Spring 2011 |title=Creating Old-Time Music for the 21st Century |url=http://oberlin.edu/alummag/spring2011/features/oldtime.html |access-date=2013-01-21 |website=Oberlin Alumni Magazine |archive-date=2012-10-13  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013005053/http://oberlin.edu/alummag/spring2011/features/oldtime.html }}</ref>

In 2005, Giddens, who at that time was spending time participating in [[Scottish traditional music]] competitions (specializing in the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[lilting]] tradition, also known as mouth music),<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wosahla |first=Steve |date=2008-04-30 |title=Carolina Chocolate Drops – Digging back, driving forward |url=http://nodepression.com/article/carolina-chocolate-drops-digging-back-driving-forward |access-date=2017-04-02 |publisher=No Depression}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Sullivan |first=John Jeremiah |date=2019-05-13 |title=Rhiannon Giddens and What Folk Music Means |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/rhiannon-giddens-and-what-folk-music-means |magazine=New Yorker |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> attended the Black Banjo Then and Now Gathering, in [[Boone, North Carolina]]. There she met [[Dom Flemons]] and Súle Greg Wilson. The three started playing together professionally as  a "postmodern string band", Sankofa Strings.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Epstein |first=Jon |title=Sankofa Strings: &#124; Features &#124; Creative Loafing Charlotte |url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/sankofa-strings/Content?oid=2141147 |access-date=2017-04-02 |website=Clclt.com}}</ref> During that same time period, Giddens was also a regular caller at local [[contra dance]]s and featured in a Celtic music band called Gaelwynd. Later in 2005, after both Gaelwynd and Sankofa Strings had released CD albums, Giddens and Flemons teamed up with other musicians and expanded the Sankofa Strings sound into what was to become the Grammy winning [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]].

In 2007, Giddens contributed fiddle, banjo, "flat-footin'" dancing and additional vocals to [[Talitha MacKenzie]]'s album ''Indian Summer''.

Performing as a soprano, Giddens and mezzo-soprano Cheryse McLeod Lewis formed a duo called Eleganza to release a CD in 2009. ''Because I Knew You...'' consists of classical, religious, theater, and movie music. Giddens and Lewis were middle school classmates who reconnected after college while working in the same office. The friends started singing together in 2003, but did not begin recording until 2008.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pandolfi |first=Elizabeth |title=Classical duo Eleganza mixes it up musically |work=Charleston City Paper |url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/classical-duo-eleganza-mixes-it-up-musically/Content?oid=3612268 |access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref>

On November 27, 2015, to coincide with the Black Friday [[Record Store Day]] event, Giddens released ''Factory Girl'' (EP) on Nonesuch Records, which contained music culled from the same T Bone Burnett–produced sessions that yielded ''Tomorrow Is My Turn''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nonesuch to Release Rhiannon Giddens's EP "Factory Girl" for Black Friday Record Store Day, November 27 &#124; Nonesuch Records |url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/nonesuch-rhiannon-giddens-ep-factory-girl-black-friday-record-store-day-november-27-2015-10-20 |access-date=2017-04-02 |website=Nonesuch.com|date=October 20, 2015 }}</ref> A digital version of Factory Girl was made available December 11, 2015.

Musicians on Factory Girl include Burnett; fiddle player [[Gabe Witcher]] and double bassist [[Paul Kowert]] of [[Punch Brothers]]; percussionist [[Jack Ashford]] of Motown's renowned [[Funk Brothers]]; drummer [[Jay Bellerose]]; guitarist [[Colin Linden]]; veteran Nashville session bassist Dennis Crouch; and Giddens's Carolina Chocolate Drops touring band-mates, multi-instrumentalist [[Hubby Jenkins]] and beat-boxer [[Adam Matta]].

Rhiannon appeared on ''[[Jools' Annual Hootenanny|Jools Holland's Hootenanny]]'' on December 31, 2015, shown on [[BBC Two]]. She performed songs from her 2015 album ''[[Tomorrow Is My Turn (album)|Tomorrow Is My Turn]]'', including "Waterboy" and a cover of "[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]" with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].

In January 2016, she was selected to take part in [[Transatlantic Sessions]].  This collaboration between American and Celtic musicians is a coveted honor. The ensemble performed as part of [[Celtic Connections]] in Glasgow, and a short UK/Irish tour.  Her performances on the tour included the stirring tribute to [[David Bowie]] "It Ain't Easy".  On October 8, 2016, Rhiannon was featured on [[Austin City Limits]].

'''Rhonda Lea Vincent''' (born July 13, 1962) is an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/vincent_rhonda/artist.jhtml|title=CMT.com : Rhonda Vincent : Artist Main|date=April 6, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406132753/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/vincent_rhonda/artist.jhtml |archive-date=April 6, 2004 }}</ref> 

Vincent's music career began when she was a child in her family's band The Sally Mountain Show, and it has spanned more than four decades. Vincent first achieved success in the bluegrass genre in the 1970s and 1980s, earning the respect of her mostly male peers for her mastery of the progressive chord structures and multi-range, fast-paced vocals intrinsic to bluegrass music. In media, Vincent has been dubbed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Bluegrass]]" by several sources.<ref name='old-bio'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kvmo.net/~rhondav/rhondavincentbio.html | title = Biography | access-date = January 15, 2012 | publisher = Rhonda Vincent | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120207113834/http://www.kvmo.net/~rhondav/rhondavincentbio.html | archive-date = February 7, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Vincent is an in-demand guest vocalist for other bluegrass and country music performers, appearing on recordings by [[Dolly Parton]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Joe Diffie]], [[Faith Hill]] and other notables.<ref name="Rhonda Vincent fact sheet">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:4rOkOJ4ILPUJ:www.kvmo.net/~rhondav/2010RVFactSheet.doc+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShmgW6Btg4gqkiIk5fNpLu0o7pvfpaVgJ2fDU_XKU94-zgsvZ6ogu8yWV617OE1zZaZfVRy25UEqXdd8Tp4cCMzNDxvk4WApwkd_9HQFJMNYwGu_Sqzx1TUlU_uJ6bsco8WcLjS&sig=AHIEtbSmvsCkQUnyahzKBQl1Yhg367XmsQ&pli=1|title=Rhonda Vincent fact sheet|access-date=June 20, 2012}}</ref>

==Early years==
Vincent was born in [[Kirksville, Missouri]], on July 13, 1962, and raised in nearby [[Greentop, Missouri]]. She is the oldest of three children, and the only daughter of Johnny and Carolyn Vincent. Her brother Darrin is a member of the  Award-winning bluegrass group [[Dailey & Vincent]]. Her youngest brother Brian played with the family group, but is now a top executive with the Bimeda Corporation. A fifth-generation musician, Rhonda's musical career started at age five when she sang gospel songs with her family's band, which was later known as the "Sally Mountain Show".<ref>Craig Morrison, "Vincent, Rhonda" in Kristin N Burns, ed. ''Women and Music in America since 1900: an Encyclopedia''. Westport, Ct .& London: Greenwood. 2002 {{ISBN|978-1573563093}} vol.2 p. 661</ref> Her father bought her a [[snare drum]] for her sixth birthday. At age eight, Vincent started playing [[mandolin]]. She later added [[fiddle]] to her list of instruments at 12. In an interview with ''Ingrams'' magazine, she said, "Dad used to pick me up after school, and Grandpa would come over and we played until after dinner almost every night. There wasn’t a lot going on in Greentop, but it was always hopping at the Vincent house."<ref name="Boone">{{cite web|last=Boone|first=Dennis|url=http://www.ingramsonline.com/Apr_2012/50Missourians/Missouriansnew13.php|title=50 Missourians you should know|publisher=Ingrams magazine.

The family, including the younger brothers when they were old enough to play instruments, traveled and performed extensively across the [[Midwest]] in the 1970s and early 1980s. Except for living in [[Texas]] for a short time in 1974, and two summers (1977, 1978) spent employed as musicians at [[Silver Dollar City]] in [[Branson, Missouri]], the Vincent family used the Greentop area as home base.<ref>Janie Shriver & Jennie Higgins, ''It's a Family Affair''. Published in ''[[The Chariton Collector]]'' magazine, Spring 1982. Pg. 30–31</ref> The Vincent children all attended [[Schuyler County, Missouri|Schuyler County R-1]] schools, and following high school Vincent later attended [[Truman State University|Northeast Missouri State University]], majoring in accounting.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Solo career==
Vincent’s life of music evolved into a successful career in bluegrass music after being discovered by Grand Ole Opry Star Jim Ed Brown, and later spending what she calls her musical college years recording for Giant Record. She learned about the music business from Nashville’s best like James Stroud, Jack McFadden, and Stan Barnett. Even while Vincent was still performing regularly with the Sally Mountain Show, she released her first solo album ''New Dreams and Sunshine'' in 1988. In 1985, Vincent had competed in the TV series ''You Can Be a Star'' on the original version of [[The Nashville Network]]. After winning the competition, she was signed to a recording contract; her first professional performance was with country singer and [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Jim Ed Brown]]. In the 1990s Vincent branched out into mainstream country music, releasing a pair of albums on the [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] label, but did not have success there.
[[File:Rhondavincent-fls.jpg|thumb|left|Rhonda Vincent on the Watson Stage, MerleFest, 2010]]

With the release of her album ''Back Home Again'' in 2000, Vincent returned to bluegrass with the goal of expanding both the musical reach and the accessibility of the genre. The [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] (IBMA) accorded her its Female Vocalist of the Year award for the years 2000 – 2006, plus IBMA Entertainer of the Year in 2001. The Society for Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America (SPBGMA) designated her its Entertainer of the Year for 2002 – 2006 inclusive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/vincent_rhonda/bio.jhtml|title=Rhonda Vincent|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030818170009/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/vincent_rhonda/bio.jhtml |access-date=July 13, 2024|archive-date=August 18, 2003 }}</ref> She also performs with her band, Rhonda Vincent & the Rage.

On February 19, 2010, Vincent parted from [[Rounder Records]], after ten years with the label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1632264/rhonda-vincent-leaves-rounder-records.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222122732/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1632264/rhonda-vincent-leaves-rounder-records.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2010|title=CMT : News : Rhonda Vincent leaves Rounder Records|publisher=CMT News|access-date=February 19, 2010}}</ref> Vincent released "Taken", her debut album on her own label Upper Management Music on September 21, 2010. Featuring special guests like long-time friend [[Dolly Parton]], [[Richard Marx]] and [[The Lewis Family|Little Roy Lewis]], the album entered the [[Top Bluegrass Albums]] chart at No.&nbsp;1.<ref name="Rhonda Vincent biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhondavincent.com/|title=Rhonda Vincent biography|publisher=Vincent official website|access-date=June 19, 2012}}</ref>

On June 7, 2011, Vincent and [[Gene Watson]] released a duet album on Upper Management entitled ''Your Money and My Good Looks''. The album entered the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Billboard charts|Top Country Albums]] chart at number 71.

''Sunday Mornin' Singin''', an album of old-time gospel standards, was released on July 10, 2012.

On April 1, 2017, Vincent's duet with a fellow country singer [[Richard Lynch (musician)|Richard Lynch]] was released as a track on Lynch's album "Mending Fences".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Papadatos|first1=Marcos|title=Review: Richard Lynch back with new country single 'Cut And Paste' |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/review-richard-lynch-back-with-new-country-single-cut-and-paste/article/489310|website=Digital Journal|date=April 2017 |access-date=April 2, 2017}}</ref>

During an appearance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on April 27, Vincent announced that she and [[Daryle Singletary]] had spent the previous months recording a duets album, with further details to follow during [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA week]]. She then introduced Singletary and the two performed a couple of [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]] songs – "[[Golden Ring (song)|Golden Ring]]" and "[[One (George Jones and Tammy Wynette album)|One]]".

It was her pivotal bluegrass album, “Back Home Again” on Rounder Records, that transformed Vincent into the All American Bluegrass Girl. She was crowned the New Queen of Bluegrass by “The Wall Street Journal” in 2000. She is a multi-award winner, with a 2017 Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album, an Entertainer of the Year 2001, Song of the Year 2004, and unprecedented seven consecutive Female Vocalist of the Year awards from the International Bluegrass Music Association 2000 – 2006.

Her powerful vocal style transcends the boundaries of bluegrass music, as evidenced in her collaboration with Dolly Parton on the Elton John / Bernie Taupin Tribute Project “Restoration” 2018. She was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry on February 28, 2020.

===Touring===
In 2008, Vincent's band performed at Centennial Hall in [[London, Ontario]], at a concert organized by the Thames Valley Bluegrass Association.<ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, June 2008</ref>

===Gospel DVD===
In a 2011 interview with television station [[KTVO]] Vincent announced that she and her band had recently filmed a live all-gospel DVD at a church in her hometown of Greentop, Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heartlandconnection.com/news/story.aspx?id=686151|title=Bluegrass Queen performs for the Heartland|publisher= KTVO-TV website|date=November 1, 2011|access-date=November 14, 2011}}</ref> The DVD was expected to be released sometime in 2012.

==Family life==
Vincent married Herb Sandker on Christmas Eve 1983.<ref name="Rhonda Vincent fact sheet"/> While it might have been more convenient to be based out of someplace like [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Vincent chose to remain close to her Missouri roots: "My husband and I made the decision early on. I loved being in my home area. My parents are there, our relatives are there. We wanted to raise our children there. So I made the decision to commute."<ref name="Boone"/> For a period of time in the late 1990s and early 2000s, they owned, and Sandker managed, a popular restaurant in Kirksville, Missouri, called Bogies.  <ref>{{cite web|last=Righi |first=Len |url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-2000-06-09-3304169-story.html |title=Home on the Web: Rhonda Vincent Turns to the Internet to Bond With Traditional Bluegrass Fans |website=MCall.com |date=June 9, 2000 |access-date=May 29, 2022}}</ref>

Vincent's elder daughter Sally wed her mother's fiddle player, Hunter Berry, in Greentop, Missouri, in 2010. Younger daughter Tensel married her mother's dobro player, Brent Burke, in 2013. Sally and Tensel have since performed with their mother, and have begun their own group with their husbands named Next Best Thing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lawless |first=John |url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/the-next-best-thing/ |title=The Next Best Thing |website=Bluegrasstoday.com |date=August 4, 2008 |access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref>

Since 1987, Rhonda and the entire Vincent family have hosted a large yearly bluegrass festival on land just west of [[Queen City, Missouri]]. The Sally Mountain Bluegrass Festival is traditionally held around July 4, and attracts music fans from across the U.S. and the world.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Skaggs was born in [[Cordell, Kentucky]].<ref name="Inc.">{{cite book|title=American Cowboy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=--oCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32|date=May–June 2000|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|page=32|issn=1079-3690}}</ref> He started playing music at age 5 after he was given a [[mandolin]] by his father, Hobert Skaggs. At age 6, he played mandolin and sang on stage with [[Bill Monroe]]. At age 7, he appeared on television's [[Martha White]] country music variety show, playing with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]]. He also wanted to audition for the [[Grand Ole Opry]] at that time, but was told he was too young.

In his mid-teens, Skaggs met a fellow teen guitarist, [[Keith Whitley]], and the two started playing together with Whitley's banjo playing brother, Dwight, on radio shows. By 1970, they had earned a spot opening for [[Ralph Stanley]], and Skaggs and Keith Whitley were thereafter invited to join Stanley's band, the [[Ralph Stanley#Clinch Mountain Boys|Clinch Mountain Boys]].<ref name = pbs>{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/ricky-skaggs-biography/ | publisher = PBS | title = Ricky Skaggs Biography| access-date = 2 March 2021}}</ref>

Skaggs later joined [[The Country Gentlemen]] in Washington, DC, [[J. D. Crowe]]'s [[New South (band)|New South]]. In 1976, Skaggs formed progressive bluegrass band Boone Creek, including members [[Vince Gill]] and [[Jerry Douglas]]. For a few years, Skaggs was a member of [[Emmylou Harris]]'s Hot Band. He wrote the arrangements for Harris's 1980 bluegrass-roots album, ''[[Roses in the Snow]]''. In addition to arranging for Harris, Skaggs sang harmony and played mandolin and fiddle in the Hot Band.

==Country career==
Skaggs launched his own career in 1980, achieving 12 No. 1 hits, 8 CMA awards, and 8 ACM awards. In 1982, he became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]], the youngest musician ever to be inducted at that time. Guitarist and producer [[Chet Atkins]] credited Skaggs with "single-handedly" saving country music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rickyskaggs.com/bio |title=The Story |publisher=Ricky Skaggs |date=July 1, 1954 |access-date=January 1, 2016 |archive-date=August 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819020842/http://www.rickyskaggs.com/bio |url-status=dead }}</ref> Skaggs is considered one of the pioneers of the [[Neotraditional country]] sub-genre.

In 1981, he debuted on [[Epic Records]] with the album ''Waitin for the Sun to Shine'', which brought him to both the country and pop charts and produced two No. 1 hits.

In 1982, he released ''[[Highways & Heartaches (Ricky Skaggs album)|Highways & Heartaches]]'', his only platinum album, featuring the instrumental heavy "[[Highway 40 Blues]]".

Keeping with his instrumental heavy themes, he released "[[Country Boy (Ricky Skaggs song)|Country Boy]]" on the album of the same name. He also had [[Bill Monroe]] as a guest on this album.

Exploring a role as producer, Skaggs produced [[Dolly Parton]]'s album ''[[White Limozeen]]'', which started her comeback in country music.

Skaggs also guested on other albums. In 1995, he sang with [[Vince Gill]] on "[[Go Rest High on That Mountain]]", which later won CMA's Song of the Year and was determined by [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] to be the Most-Performed Song in 1997.

==Later career==

In 1996, Skaggs went back to his [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] roots, and also experimented with new sounds. With his band, [[Kentucky Thunder]], he is a perennial winner of Grammy Awards and International Bluegrass Music Association for best bluegrass album.

"Hosking's music isn't like the polished, over-produced music found in pop culture. Hers is a minimalist sound that reflects a simpler time and place: a little country town, rather than a big city."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:DVEB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1106562C5F3184F8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0FCEDEB95BD4D563 |title=Channeling simpler times - Folksinger records her own life and upbringing in old-style ballads by Landon Christensen |publisher=Docs.newsbank.com |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

Leading up to her 2010 performance tour of Great Britain, she received increasing attention on the "East Side" of the pond.

==Influences and inspirations==
Hosking grew up in a rural area in [[Shasta County, California]].  Her father worked the night shift at a sawmill as part of the area's logging industry. Her great-grandfather, from [[Cornwall]], southwest of England, was an underground coal miner in the region. Her grandmother's family had headed there in a covered wagon on the Oregon Trail, from Virginia.

Hosking says old-time music was strong in her mountain area, as well as country. She grew up hearing neighbors play their simple instruments by ear, as a group called the Mountaineers. And the school cook took several girls from the school, taught them songs and they performed as the Farmerettes; with the Farmerettes, Hosking played washboard and sang her first solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/146046838 |title=Article by Patrick S. Pemberton, The Tribune, San Luis Obispo, California. Friday, June 18, 2010. |publisher=Californiachronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055628/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/146046838 |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''"I'm no expert on the Appalachians at all, but I figure there are similarities -- the economy and some traditions, logging and mining. So, as a songwriter, you focus on that. You take the human struggle to survive, particularly in a beautiful place they love, and you've pinned down a lot of artistic inspiration."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/saginawnews/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-1/1217654410164730.xml&coll=9 |title=California singer understands folk roots |publisher=Mlive.com |date=2008-08-02 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

==Come Sunrise==
During the spring of 2008 at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090428021851/http://www.strawberrymusic.com/home.asp Strawberry Music Festival] Rita heard a performance of Mississippi native [[Caroline Herring]].  Hosking bought Herring's album and discovered that [http://www.richbrotherton.com/ Rich Brotherton], longtime mandolin and guitar player in [[Robert Earl Keen]]'s band, had produced it.  "I loved it," says Hosking, "so I 'My Spaced' him and said, 'Hi, my name is Rita. Would you be interested in producing my next album?' He wrote right back and said, 'Sure.'"   In addition to Brotherton, she was backed by such musicians as [[Lloyd Maines]] (father of [[Dixie Chicks]] lead singer Natalie Maines and a well-known musician and record producer), Warren Hood of the Waybacks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waybacks.com/ |title=Homepage of the Waybacks |publisher=Waybacks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> and Tom Van Schaik and Marty Muse from Keen's band.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130815204617/http://www.sacbee.com/music/story/1509681.html Pop Music: Rita Hosking: Down from the mountains, Davis singer-songwriter's sound mines a rich, generations-old vein, By Dixie Reid, Published: Friday, Jan. 02, 2009]</ref>

This collaboration evolved into "Come Sunrise", which was released in June 2009 and is available through CD Baby, Digstation, and iTunes.   It was recorded and produced at Ace Recording <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acerecording.net/ |title=Ace Recording homepage |publisher=Acerecording.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> in Austin, Texas.

As described by Stuart Mason:    "''On her new release Come Sunrise, singer-songwriter Rita Hosking reflects her upbringing in rural Shasta County. Her breed of Nor Cal country folk ain’t quite old-timey, and it ain’t quite bluegrass, but damn it’s sweet. For fans of Emmylou and Gillian, this one’s a safe bet. The songs of Rita Hoskings are as fragile as a newborn baby, and defiant as a West Virginia coal miner''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fiddlefreak.com/2009/10/21/rita-hosking/ |title=Review of ''Come Sunrise'' on the Fiddlefreak Folk Music Blog, October 21, 2009 |publisher=Fiddlefreak.com |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

As described by Neil Spencer of the Guardian (UK):   "''Hosking . . . hits impressive form on this album.  Her songs are compassionate tales about ordinary folk from her north Californian background – loggers, miners, the mothers of lost sons – but there is anger as well as warmth in her voice. "Montgomery Creek Blues" and "Promise Land" in particular meld the personal and political to become state-of-the-nation songs''."<ref>{{cite news|author=Neil Spencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/03/rita-hosking-come-sunrise-review/ |title=Review of ''Come Sunrise'' in the Music Section of the Guardian (UK), January 3, 2010 |publisher=Guardian |date= 2010-01-03|accessdate=2011-11-04 |location=London}}</ref>

In July 2009 "Come Sunrise" placed Number 12 on the national Freeform American Roots Chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcmnradio.com/far/far120.htm |title=Freeform American Roots Chart of July 2009 |publisher=Tcmnradio.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126065540/http://www.tcmnradio.com/far/far120.htm |archive-date=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

"Come Sunrise" was selected as one of five contenders for the country music "album of the year" of the 9th annual Independent Music Awards, announced in November 2009 (see description under ''Recognition and Awards'').

He also recorded his original compositions.

=== Nashville ===
While living in Chicago, Fulks worked for four years as a country songwriter, mainly for Music Row publisher API.<ref name=CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001 /> His solo debut album, ''Country Love Songs'', engineered by [[Steve Albini]],<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> was released on Bloodshot Records in 1996 and received positive reviews. The Skeletons, members of whom later formed the band [[The Morells]], played on most of the tracks<ref name="NoDep-LindaRay1997" /> and [[Tom Brumley]] and [[Buck Owens]] also featured. ''Country Love Songs'' was followed in 1997 by ''South Mouth'', which confirmed Fulks's retro-alternative image.

Fans had grown used to his rough and sparse sound, but his third album, 1998's ''Let's Kill Saturday Night'', on [[Geffen Records]],<ref name="Soundbite-2000">{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Jesse|title=Soundbite: Music Man|url=http://reason.com/archives/2000/05/01/soundbite-music-man|work=Reason.com|publisher=Reason Foundation|access-date=December 27, 2013|date=May 2000|archive-date=November 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111103225/http://reason.com/archives/2000/05/01/soundbite-music-man|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="NYT-Dresden">{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Neil|title=A Major Merger Shakes Up the World of Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/arts/a-major-merger-shakes-up-the-world-of-rock.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|access-date=December 28, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1998|archive-date=January 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116152111/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/arts/a-major-merger-shakes-up-the-world-of-rock.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|url-status=live}}</ref> was different.

Geffen Records disbanded shortly after the release of the record and Fulks, finding himself without a label, started his own company, Boondoggle Records, and released an album of previously unreleased material called ''The Very Best of Robbie Fulks''. He also licenses his music for distribution by Bloodshot.<ref name="CMHoF-13HillbillyGiants-2001" />

{{Quote box
 |quote  = I called it ''Gone Away Backward'' because it's a phrase from the Bible… I stumbled on the phrase later in the evolution of the record when I was looking around for a title. I think it's a nice piquant phrase that has three good, strong, mellifluous words in it. As far as the backwardness of the record, I think it goes backward in terms of nostalgia for the past – bittersweet nostalgia for the past – as well as the recession having knocked everything backwards for people. In that sense, it's not an album about the past, it's an album about now.

In 2001 he released ''Couples in Trouble'', a dark, brooding, and decidedly non-country album, and ''13 Hillbilly Giants'', a collection of covers of classic country numbers, both obscure and well known. Both records were released by Bloodshot Records. Also in 2001, Fulks was an inaugural member of the judging panel for the Independent Music Awards, which supported independent artists.<ref name=IMA-judges>{{cite web|title=Past Judges for the Independent Music Awards|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp|work=Independent Music Awards|access-date=December 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024722/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp|archive-date=July 13, 2011}}</ref>

Fulks did not release another album until 2005. ''Georgia Hard'' on [[Yep Roc Records]] was a return to his county roots, and was notable for its use of long-time Nashville talent such as [[Lloyd Green]], Hank Singer, [[Dennis Crouch (bassist)|Dennis Crouch]], and [[Dallas Wayne]].<ref name=Pure2005 /> He also released a novelty single called "Fountains of Wayne Hotline," in which he imagined the power pop band [[Fountains of Wayne]] having a hotline that struggling songwriters could call for help with their song structure.

In April 2007, Fulks released a 2-CD album, ''Revenge!'' (also on Yep Roc Records), which consisted mainly of live concert recordings of older songs and included some new material. One disc, labeled ''Standing'', featured a full-band sound, while the second disc, ''Sitting,'' consisted of Fulks solo with little or no musical accompaniment. ''Standing'' opens with the tongue-in-cheek studio track "We're on the Road", which describes life on tour and simulates a telephone call to Fulks from Yep Roc Records President Glenn Dicker, demanding a new record and denigrating the sales performance of the "path-breaking, not chart-breaking" album ''Georgia Hard.''

In 2009, Fulks released an alphabetically organized collection of 50 songs via his website, a compilation called ''50-Vc. Doberman.''<ref name="NYTimes-50">{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|title=Playlist: Expansive Pop, Hypnotic Jazz, Surprising Metal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/arts/music/08play.html?_r=0|access-date=December 28, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 4, 2009|archive-date=April 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413203308/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/arts/music/08play.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref> He noted that this method, and electronic-only release in general, was not typical of musicians who worked in his genre.<ref name="ChiReader-AlbiniFulks-2014" /> In 2010, Fulks released his next album, ''Happy: Robbie Fulks Plays the Music of Michael Jackson,'' on Yep Roc Records, in which he covered some of Jackson's songs as a tribute.

==Biography==
Ron Block heard a variety of music at an early age because his father owned a music store, Hogan's House of Music, in southern California. At home he was drawn to the bluegrass music of [[Bill Monroe]], [[J. D. Crowe]], and [[The Stanley Brothers]]. At the age of 13, after seeing [[Earl Scruggs]] on TV, he learned to play the banjo.

A prominent figure in [[Appalachian folk music]],<ref name="PetrusCohen2015">{{cite book|author1=Stephen Petrus|author2=Ronald D. Cohen|title=Folk City: New York and the American Folk Music Revival|url=https://archive.org/details/folkcitynewyorka0000petr|url-access=registration|date=8 June 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-023103-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/folkcitynewyorka0000petr/page/183 183]–}}</ref> Holcomb was the inspiration for the term "high, lonesome sound", coined by folklorist and friend [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]]. The "high lonesome sound" term is now used to describe [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] singing, although Holcomb was not, strictly speaking, a bluegrass performer.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

==Performance style==
Holcomb's repertoire included [[old-time music]], [[hymns]], [[traditional music]] and [[blues]] ballads. In addition to playing the banjo and guitar, he was a competent [[harmonica]] and [[fiddle]] player, and sang many of his most memorable songs [[a cappella]]. Holcomb stated: "Up till then the blues were only inside me; [[Blind Lemon]] was the first to 'let out' the blues."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/116 116]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/116}}</ref>

Holcomb sang in a nasal style informed by the [[Old Regular Baptist]] vocal tradition. [[Bob Dylan]], a fan of Holcomb, described his singing as possessing "an untamed sense of control".<ref name="AllMusic_Untamed">{{AllMusic|album|mw0000019275|''An Untamed Sense of Control''}}</ref> He was also admired by the [[Stanley Brothers]] and [[Eric Clapton]], who cited Holcomb as his favorite country musician.<ref name="AllMusic_Untamed" />

==Life and career ==
A [[coal miner]], construction laborer and farmer for much of his life,<ref name="Wolfe2015">{{cite book|author=Charles K.

Holcomb gave his last live performance in 1978. Due to what he described as injuries he sustained during his long career as a laborer, Holcomb was eventually unable to work for more than short periods, and his later income came primarily from his music. Suffering from asthma and [[emphysema]] as a result of working in coal mines, he died in a nursing home in 1981, at the age of 68.<ref name="cohen2">{{cite book|author=John Cohen|title=The High & Lonesome Sound: The Legacy of Roscoe Holcomb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KpPYgEACAAJ|year=2012|publisher=Steidl|isbn=978-3-86930-254-6}}</ref>

Since early 2007, Camp had been collaborating with country legend [[Loretta Lynn]] writing songs such as "I'm Dyin' for Someone to Live For" and "I'm More Alone When I'm With You" together. Camp has featured some of the photographs taken at the Cash Cabin Studios in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]] which many believe means he is going to be duetting on some of Lynn's upcoming albums. The pair usually wrote together at Lynn's home in [[Hurricane Mills, Tennessee]] (known as The Loretta Lynn Dude Ranch.)

In September 2010, Reprise Records issued the previously-unreleased 1994 album, retitled ''1994''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/09/03/shawn-camps-shelved-1994-album-to-be-released/|title=Shawn Camp's shelved 1994 album to be released|last=Cooper|first=Peter|date=September 3, 2010|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|access-date=September 27, 2010}}</ref>

On her 2011 second release on Rounder Records, the 20-year-old has composed seven of the 12 songs and it was produced by [[Alison Krauss & Union Station]] bassist [[Barry Bales]]. The album features collaborations with Bryan Sutton on guitar and Randy Kohrs on dobro. Guest singers include [[Dan Tyminski]], Shawn Lane and Ronnie Bowman.

=== ''Weighted Mind'' ===
Released on January 29, 2016, ''[[Weighted Mind]]'', Hull's third LP, was produced by the highly regarded banjo player [[Béla Fleck]], who encouraged Hull to consider recording it solo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mandolincafe.com/forum/content.php?201-Sierra-Hull-The-Weighted-Mind-Interview|title=Mandolin Cafe – Sierra Hull – The Weighted Mind Interview|work=Mandolin Cafe Forum|access-date=April 10, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Hull, however, decided to enlist an accompanist, bassist Ethan Jodziewicz, who is featured on every track. The album also includes vocal contributions by [[Alison Krauss]], [[Abigail Washburn]], and [[Rhiannon Giddens]].

NPR reviewer Jewly Hight called ''Weighted Mind'' a "stunning coming-of-age album," adding that "Hull has joined the rarefied company of [[Nickel Creek]] expats [[Chris Thile]], [[Sara Watkins]] and [[Sean Watkins]], pedigreed virtuosos whose youthful, searching musical minds have taken them into postmodern singer-songwriter territory and beyond."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/20/463722383/first-listen-sierra-hull-weighted-mind|title=Review: Sierra Hull, 'Weighted Mind'|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref>

Liam Lewis opined, "25 Trips is an eclectic album, with a contemporary feel, showcasing Hull’s songwriting and exceptional vocals, crystal clear but with emotion and character, on 13 songs, self and co-written on the pleasures and travails of becoming the person and the musician she is today."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellesandgals.com/2020/03/12/review-sierra-hull-25-trips/|title=Review: Sierra Hull – 25 Trips|first=Liam|last=Lewis|date=March 12, 2020|accessdate=March 15, 2021}}</ref>

'''The Chicks''' (formerly the '''Dixie Chicks''') are an American [[country band]] from [[Dallas]], Texas. The band consists of [[Natalie Maines]] (lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar) and sisters [[Martie Maguire]] (vocals, fiddle, [[mandolin]], guitar) and [[Emily Strayer]] (vocals, guitar, banjo, [[Dobro]]). Maguire and Strayer, both née Erwin, founded the band in 1989, with bassist Laura Lynch and vocalist and guitarist Robin Lynn Macy. They performed [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a [[major label]]. In 1992, Lynch replaced Macy as the lead vocalist.

After releasing three independent albums, the Dixie Chicks signed to [[Monument Records|Monument Records Nashville]] in 1997, by which point Maines had joined. They achieved success with their albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' (1998) and ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' (1999). After Monument closed its Nashville branch, the Dixie Chicks moved to [[Columbia Records]] for ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'' (2002). These albums achieved [[multi-platinum]] sales in the United States, Canada, and Australia, along with several charting singles on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Their successful US singles were "[[There's Your Trouble]]", "[[Wide Open Spaces (song)|Wide Open Spaces]]", "[[You Were Mine]]", "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]", "[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]", and a cover of [[Bruce Robison]]'s "[[Travelin' Soldier]]". The Dixie Chicks also reached number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart with their 2002 cover of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]".

Days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Maines [[Dixie Chicks comments on George W. Bush|told a London audience that the Dixie Chicks did not endorse the war]] and were ashamed of US President [[George W. Bush]] being from Texas. The remarks triggered boycotts in the US and a backlash from fans. After a hiatus, the Dixie Chicks recorded ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' in 2006, an album informed by the backlash. "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]" became their biggest crossover single, reaching number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. After a second hiatus, Maguire and Strayer recorded as a duo called [[Court Yard Hounds]]. The Dixie Chicks reunited to tour in the 2010s. In 2020, they removed "[[Dixie]]" from their name due to negative connotations, and released their first album in 14 years, ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]].''

The Chicks have won 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, including five in 2007 for ''Taking the Long Way,'' which received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], and its single "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]", which received the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]].

==History==

===1989–1995: Original bluegrass group===
[[File:IMAG2591-dallas-downtown.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Chicks formed in [[Dallas]], Texas (seen here in 2016).]]
The Chicks were founded as the Dixie Chicks in 1989 in [[Dallas]], Texas, an area with country music roots. The original lineup consisted of El Paso native Laura Lynch on [[upright bass]], Californian Robin Lynn Macy on guitar, and the multi-instrumentalist sisters [[Martie Maguire|Martie]] and [[Emily Strayer|Emily Erwin]], respectively born in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and raised in Dallas. The Erwin sisters, who were later married and both changed their names twice (Martie to Martie Seidel, then Martie Maguire; Emily to Emily Robison, then Emily Strayer).

In 1990, Penny Cook, the daughter of then-Texas senator [[John Tower]], gave the Dixie Chicks $10,000 to record an album. Later that year, the Dixie Chicks released their debut studio album ''[[Thank Heavens for Dale Evans]]'' on a local independent label called Crystal Clear Sound.

In 1992, the Dixie Chicks' next Crystal Clear Sound release, ''[[Little Ol' Cowgirl]]'', moved towards a more contemporary country sound, as the band used more [[session musician]]s, and developed a richer sound with larger and more modern arrangements. Macy and Maguire each wrote two of the album's songs, with Lynch co-writing one song with Maguire.

Lynch became lead singer on the Dixie Chicks' third Crystal Clear Sound album, ''[[Shouldn't a Told You That]]'' (1993).

After Maines joined the band, the instrumental lineup was essentially the same, though Maines was not an acoustic bassist.

The source of the Dixie Chicks' commercial success during this time came from various factors: they wrote or co-wrote about half of the songs on ''Wide Open Spaces'' and ''Fly''; their mixture of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], mainstream [[country music]], [[blues]], and pop songs appealed to a wide spectrum of record buyers, and where the women had once dressed as "cowgirls" with Lynch, their dress was now more contemporary.<ref name="Ankeny"/>

"Cowboy Take Me Away" from ''Fly'' became another [[signature song]], written by Maguire to celebrate Emily's marriage with country singer [[Charlie Robison]], which took place three months before the album's release. However, a few of their songs brought controversy within their conservative country music fan base, and two songs caused some radio stations to remove the Dixie Chicks from their playlists: "[[Sin Wagon]]", from which the term "mattress dancing" takes on a new twist, and "[[Goodbye Earl]]", a song that uses [[black comedy]] in telling the story of the unabashed murderer of an abusive husband. (The band later made a video portraying the nefarious deed, with actor [[Dennis Franz]] playing the murdered husband.) In an interview, Maines commented about Sony worrying about the reference to "mattress dancing" in "Sin Wagon", refusing to discuss it in interviews.

===2006–2007: ''Taking the Long Way'' and ''Shut Up and Sing''===

Cowritten with [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]], it addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the previous three years.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238 "Dixie Chicks Return, 'Taking the Long Way'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011181537/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238 |date=October 11, 2017 }} – [[NPR]] Interview on ''[[All Things Considered]]'', May 23, 2006.</ref> Strayer said, "The stakes were definitely higher on that song. We knew it was special because it was so autobiographical, and we had to get it right. And once we had that song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." She said writing the song had become their "therapy", since they had to hold in so many stored emotions for so long. Thus, the band considered the album not so much political as very personal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238|title=Dixie Chicks Return, 'Taking the Long Way'|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=May 23, 2006|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=July 29, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517170753/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5424238|archive-date=May 17, 2008}}</ref>

''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' was released in stores and online on May 22, 2006. The album was produced by [[Rick Rubin]] who had worked with [[hard rock]] acts such as [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[System of a Down]], as well as idiosyncratic singers such as [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Neil Diamond]].

Neither "Not Ready to Make Nice" or second single "[[Everybody Knows (Dixie Chicks song)|Everybody Knows]]" reached top 35 on Hot Country Songs.  In June 2006, Emily Strayer noted the lack of support from other country music performers: "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism."<ref name=Telegraph/>

Maines said, "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why do you have to be a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ...

When the Dixie Chicks performed again at Shepherd's Bush Empire, site of "The Incident", Maines joked that she wanted to say something the audience had not heard before, but instead said, "Just so y'all know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas," to much laughter and applause.<ref name="Documentary film Shut Up and Sing">[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]], at Shepherd's Bush, London</ref>

In 2006, ''Taking the Long Way'' was the ninth-best-selling album in the United States.

'''The Chuck Wagon Gang''' is a [[Country gospel]] musical group, formed in 1935 by David P. ("Dad") Carter, oldest son Ernest ("Jim") along with daughters Lola ("Rose") and Effie ("Anna").<ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref> The group got their first radio break as sponsored singers for Bewley Flour in 1936.<ref>Rick Marsehall ''Encyclopedia of Country and Western Music'' 1990 Page 33 "Soon thereafter, Bewley Flour lost their sponsored singers on the station, the Chuck Wagon Gang, and the Carters were asked to assume the role. The year was 1936, "</ref> The "Gang" signed with [[Columbia Records]] and remained with them for 39 years, a world record that lasted until 2000, when [[Johnny Mathis]]' overall time with the same label (combining his signing in 1957 and re-signing in 1968) entered its 40th year. At one point they were Columbia's number one group with over 39 million in record sales.<ref name="titleThe Renaissance Center - Home - News - Chuck Wagon Gang 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=The Renaissance Center - Home - News - Chuck Wagon Gang 2003 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=The Renaissance Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=2012-08-10 }}The Chuck Wagon Gang's Start</ref>

The Chuck Wagon Gang has performed at [[Carnegie Hall]], the [[Hollywood Bowl]], and the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. The group has been inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s classic American recordings.<ref name="titleThe Renaissance Center - Home - News - Chuck Wagon Gang 2003"/>

==1930s to 1970s== 
The group was founded in 1935 broadcasting from radio station [[KFYO (AM)|KFYO]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]], and took the name in 1936 when they moved to [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]] in [[Fort Worth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sghistory.com/index.php?n=C.Chuck_Wagon_Gang|title=Southern Gospel History - C / ChuckWagonGang|website=sghistory.com}}</ref>  The original members sang together all the way to 1955 when Dad Carter retired, later passing away in 1963, followed by Jim in 1971.  Sons Eddie and Roy Carter stepped in to sing tenor and bass, respectively, which began the tradition of Carter siblings, children, and eventually grandchildren joining the Gang.

By the mid-1970s, the group was still touring part-time but felt a lack of support from the label they had recorded for during the previous three decades.  Columbia had stopped servicing their songs to radio; thus, airplay had become non-existent. The decision was eventually made to move on from Columbia in the interest of rebuilding the group to a position akin to what it had enjoyed in years past. To that end, in 1979 they began recording for Copperfield Records and remained with that label for several years. <ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref>

==1980s to Present Day==
After its relationship with Copperfield Records ended, the Chuck Wagon Gang began recording for Associated Artists.  It was during this era that the group took advantage of its renewed popularity and, in keeping with the gospel sounds of the time, added a piano player to the lineup for live concerts.  Fans responded positively to this sound, eventually culminating in the Gang receiving the "Best Gospel Group in Country Music" award at the Music City News Awards in 1988. <ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref>

Roy approached Anna's granddaughter Shaye in 1993, asking her to assume the responsibility of singing soprano upon the retirement of member Debbie Trusty.  Shaye accepted Roy's offer and sang soprano with the Gang until the retirement of alto singer Ruth Ellen Carter Yates a few years later, when she moved to her current position of alto singer.   Roy subsequently retired, bringing about a new era for the Gang in which none of Dad Carter's children were members.  As the 21st century dawned, the Gang sought to return to its origins, paring its sound back to the beautiful simplicity of four-part harmony accompanied by a single guitar.  Once again, fans responded positively.  As of 2024, the Gang records for Crossroads Label Group. (Source: {{cite web |url=https://thechuckwagongang.net/ |title=Official Website}})

'''The Common Linnets''' are a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] band that was formed in 2013. The band originally consisted of [[Ilse DeLange]] and [[Waylon (Dutch singer)|Waylon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About The Common Linnets|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year/participant-profile/?song=32243|publisher=eurovision.tv|access-date=8 May 2014}}</ref> DeLange has stated that the group is a platform for Dutch artists to make country, Americana, and bluegrass music, and that the members will be changing. In May 2014, Waylon left the group and was replaced by American country singer Jake Etheridge.

Their song "[[Calm After the Storm]]", which is on [[The Common Linnets (album)|their self-titled debut album]], reached second place in the final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014]] and gave the Netherlands its best result since [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975|its last winning entry in 1975]].

==Name==
Ilse de Lange and Waylon are both from the eastern part of the Netherlands. In Dutch, people from this region are sometimes called ''heikneuters'', referring to the songbird ''kneu''<ref>{{cite web|title= Name, logo and artwork design The Common Linnets|url= http://www.rensdekker.nl/uk/Portfolio/item/61/|access-date=9 May 2014| publisher=rensdekker.nl|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> or [[common linnet]]. The name for the band is an idea from Dutch designer Rens Dekker,<ref>[http://www.rensdekker.nl Rens Dekker]</ref> who is also responsible for the artwork design of their single and self-titled album.

==Members==
The band was originally composed of individual country artists [[Ilse DeLange]] and [[Waylon (Dutch singer)|Waylon]]. However, Waylon stated that the band was created by Ilse and that she is, at the moment, the main leader. Ilse said that she created the band as a project or a "platform" for Dutch artists to make country, Americana or bluegrass music. Both artists stated that both artists can "be replaced" by other musicians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Telegraaf.nl 'Ilse gat over The Common Linnets'|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/tv/prive/overig/22677689/___Ilse_gaat_over_The_Common_Linnets___.html|publisher=telegraaf.nl|access-date=28 May 2014}}</ref> Since May 2014 the band consists of Ilse DeLange, JB Meijers, Jake Etheridge and Matthew Crosby (also the writers of the hit song "Calm After The Storm").

Ilse DeLange was born on 13 May 1977 in [[Almelo]], [[Netherlands]]. She started her career at the age of 8, and was later featured in regional and national talent shows in [[Hilversum]]. She formed a duo with guitarist Joop Liefland.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Waylon was born on 20 April 1980 in [[Apeldoorn]], Netherlands. His stage name came from the name of his idol [[Waylon Jennings]]. After the Eurovision contest, the band went on a promotional tour in the Netherlands and some European countries. Fans however noted the absence of Waylon raising suspicion that he has left the group or even had been permanently replaced. Waylon wrote an article on his official Facebook website that "both members did not foresee the success of the band" and that he is currently occupied with his album that is going to be released in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Telegraaf.nl 'Waylon is gevonden'|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/muziek/22677591/__Waylon_is_gevonden___.html|publisher=telegraaf.nl|access-date=28 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Facebook: Waylon Music|url=https://www.facebook.com/waylonmusic|publisher=facebook|access-date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

JB Meijers was born on 10 June 1972 in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. Before joining the Common Linnets, Meijers played guitar in Dutch indie bands Charmin' Children, Shine and Supersub. He also played with De Dijk, Eboman and Acda & De Munnik and worked as a producer. Meijers replaced Waylon as the frontman of the band alongside DeLange. Meijers wrote the song ''Calm After the Storm''.

Jake Etheridge was born on 25 April 1988 in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].  Before joining the band, he uploaded several songs online.  Dividing his time between Nashville and the Netherlands, he joined the band in 2014, following Waylon's departure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jakeetheridge.com/blog/|title=Jake Etheridge Blog|publisher=jakeetheridge.com|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
The band has released six full-length albums.  They independently released a self-titled album in 2002.  Another independent release followed in 2004, ''Longjohns, Boots, And A Belt''.  The band recorded two shows in April 2006 in [[Felton, California|Felton]], [[California]] with guest [[fiddle]]r Chojo Jacques.  The recordings were later released as a live album, ''A Little Bit Faster And A Little Bit Worse''.

After the release of their live album, the band signed with independent label [[Milan Records]], which specializes in [[film scores]] and [[soundtrack]]s.  Their first album on Milan was a re-release of their debut album, ''The Devil Makes Three''.  In 2009, they followed with an all-new album, ''Do Wrong Right''.

Band member Bernhard independently released a solo album, ''Things I Left Behind'' (2006).  In September 2009 Bernhard released his next solo album, ''Straight Line'', on Milan Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/09/june/30The_Devil_Makes_Three_Frontman_Goes_Solo_Again.shtml|title=The Devil Makes Three Frontman Goes Solo Again|date=30 June 2009|website=Antimusic.com|accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>

McBean and Bernhard are originally from near Brattleboro, Vermont, where they played music together as childhood friends and when they were in high school.  They were also acquainted with Turino (from New Hampshire but raised in Vermont), but didn't know her well.  After graduating from high school, all three moved to California separately, Bernhard by way of Nashville.  Bernhard and McBean re-connected in Olympia.  Later in Santa Cruz they also became reacquainted with Turino, forming the band soon after in 2001.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Linn|first1=Sarah|title=The Devil Makes Three ready to rock at SLO concert|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article39510666.html|website=The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=28 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jasper|first1=David|title=Hillbilly punk: The Devil Makes Three has unplugged and gone country|url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/slideshows/1506523-151/hillbilly-punk|website=The Bulletin|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=14 April 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fun Has Just Begun: The Devil Makes Three comes home thirsty and ready to rock|url=http://goodtimes.sc/uncategorized/fun-has-just-begun/|website=Goodtimes.sc|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=27 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Lauren|title=Doing Wrong Right: The Devil Makes Three|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/the-devil-makes-three-stomp-and-smash/|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Kate|title=Devil's in the Details|url=http://inweekly.net/wordpress/?p=9993|website=In Weekly |accessdate=14 January 2018|date=16 May 2012}}</ref>  Before forming The Devil Makes Three with Turino, both Bernhard and McBean played in punk bands and later toured as a duo.<ref name="charleston">{{cite web |last1=Lawrence |first1=Stratton |title=Moshing with folk-punk act the Devil Makes Three |url=https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/moshing-with-folk-punk-act-the-devil-makes-three/Content?oid=3654375 |website=Charleston City Paper |accessdate=4 September 2018 |date=3 December 2011}}</ref>

== History ==

The original concept of the Grascals occurred when the four core members, Terry Eldredge, Jamie Johnson, Jimmy Mattingly, and Dave Talbot, asked Terry Smith and Danny Roberts to join a new group they were wanting to start. They played one of their first shows at the Station Inn in February 2004 with special guest [[Osborne Brothers|Bobby Osborne]]. The Grascals began recording their first album in 2004, which would simply be a self-titled album on [[Rounder Records]]. This album featured such songs as "Me and John and Paul" written by [[Harley Allen]], "[[Where Corn Don't Grow]]" and another popular cover song, "Viva Las Vegas," which featured Dolly Parton.  During the recording, [[Dolly Parton]] showed interest in wanting to play with the Grascals.  The band soon became Dolly's opening act, as well as her bluegrass band.<ref name="bluegrasstoday.com"/> Performing at [[Dollywood]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]], the band and Dolly played a cover version of [[Elvis]]'s song, [[Viva Las Vegas (song)|"Viva Las Vegas."]] The [[The grascals (album)|first album]] made it on to the Billboard charts, as well as many country and bluegrass charts. Also on the album cover, Dolly is quoted saying, "One of the greatest albums I've ever heard."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-grascals|title=The Grascals Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>

'''The GrooveGrass Boyz''' were an American musical group that played a mix of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[funk]], and [[freestyle music]]. The group was founded as a side project by record producer and session musician Scott Rouse in 1987, after he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass and country songs, eventually applying the term groovegrass to his mix of music. He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and joined several other country musicians and funk bass guitarist [[Bootsy Collins]], releasing a country version of [[Los del Río]]'s "[[Macarena]]" and two albums. The country cover of "Macarena" charted on both the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]], and was the group's only chart entry.

==History==
Rouse, a [[session musician]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], first came up with the idea of GrooveGrass in the mid-1980s when he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass songs such as [[Alton Delmore]]'s "Deep River Blues". His mixes became popular at local clubs, eventually leading to one disc jockey terming the blend of music "groovegrass".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p350665/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=GrooveGrass biography |accessdate=2008-08-21 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

Rouse then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at the request of his friend, musician [[Doc Watson]]. Rouse's first country remix was for [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] It was a remix of [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 Number One single "[[Swingin' (John Anderson song)|Swingin']]." At Anderson's request, Warner never released the cut, although it became a popular [[bootleg recording]].<ref name="allmusic"/> It was followed by an [[Extended play|EP]] remix of "[[Rocky Top]]", which was released and went on to sell more than 100,000 copies in the United States.<ref name="allmusic"/> Rouse also produced comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s trademark "You might be a redneck if…" single he named called the "Redneck Stomp",<ref name="bb"/> one of several similar musical tracks included on Foxworthy's ''[[Crank It Up: The Music Album]]''.

Soon afterward, Rouse recruited several other musicians, including members of [[Del McCoury]]'s band, funk bass guitarist [[Bootsy Collins]], and bluegrass multi-instrumentalist [[Jerry Douglas]], to perform as the GrooveGrass Boyz.<ref name="news">{{cite web |url=http://www.musiciansnews.com/mastering/18/nashville_producer_scott_rouse_mixing_groovegrass_with_the_u.shtml |title=Nashville producer Scott Rouse Mixing GrooveGrass with the UAD-1 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |work=Musicians' News}}</ref> They saw their most successful release in late 1996, when they put out a country version of the "[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]", a song made popular earlier that year by Spanish duo [[Los del Río]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The GrooveGrass Boyz' version, released on [[Imprint Records]],<ref name="bb">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4626736-1.html |title=Groovegrass' Scott Rouse Weds Unlikely Pair Of Bluegrass, R&B |accessdate=2008-08-21 |last=Bessman |first=Jim |date=1999-01-09 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> peaked at No.&nbsp;70 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]].

'''The Isaacs''' are a bluegrass [[Southern gospel]] music group consisting of mother Lily Isaacs (b. September 20, 1947), daughters Becky (b. Aug. 2, 1975) and [[Sonya Isaacs]] (b. July 22, 1974) and son Ben Isaacs (b. July 25, 1972), along with John Bowman (husband of Becky Isaacs) as an instrumentalist and songwriter. Joe Isaacs, formerly a singer and banjo player in the group, has left since his 1998 divorce from Lily Isaacs. He now does solo work on a far more localized level.

Former Kingsmen Quartet bass player, lead singer and baritone Tim Surrett was a member of group from 1997 until 2002. Surrett was married to Sonya Isaacs during this time period. Thomas Wywrot was a member from 2008 to 2011. Sonya Isaacs' husband, [[Jimmy Yeary]], took his place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.singingnews.com/Southern-Gospel-News/11655741/ |title=Jimmy Yeary Joins The Isaacs &#124; The Southern Gospel Music Magazine |publisher=SingingNews.com |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2012-07-06 |archive-date=2011-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017015300/http://www.singingnews.com/Southern-Gospel-News/11655741/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The group's roots go back to 1971,<ref name="people">{{cite news |last1=Etienne |first1=Vanessa |title=The Isaacs Premiere 'The American Face' Music Video: 'United We Stand' |url=https://people.com/music/isaacs-premiere-the-american-face-music-video-united-we-stand/ |access-date=12 July 2021 |work=PEOPLE.com |language=en}}</ref> when Joe and Lily Isaacs began a bluegrass band. Lily's parents are [[The Holocaust in Poland|Polish Jewish Holocaust]] survivors. A few years after they were liberated from a concentration camp in Germany in 1945, her parents moved two year old Lily to New York City, where, in 1958, she got a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] and started performing in night clubs. While performing with his Kentucky band at the [[Gerde's Folk City]], Joe met Lily and they were married in 1970. After Joe's brother died in an automobile accident, Joe and Lily became Christians, and the group began to perform only bluegrass gospel music.<ref name="lufkin">{{cite news |last1=BARCLAY |first1=BRITTANY |title=The Isaacs to bring bluegrass gospel to The Pines |url=https://lufkindailynews.com/news/community/article_94d60ad4-b88c-5651-a672-7ce01b2b7c36.html |access-date=12 July 2021 |work=The Lufkin Daily News |language=en}}</ref> The group was initially named the Calvary Mountain Boys and later became Sacred Bluegrass before settling on the family name, the Isaacs.

'''The Louvin Brothers''' were an American musical duo composed of brothers [[Ira Louvin|Ira]] and [[Charlie Louvin]] (''né'' Loudermilk). The brothers are cousins to [[John D. Loudermilk]], a [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] member.

The brothers wrote and performed [[country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[gospel music]]. Ira played [[mandolin]] and generally sang lead vocal in the [[tenor]] range, while Charlie played [[rhythm guitar]] and offered supporting vocals in a lower pitch. They helped popularize the vocal technique of [[close harmony]] in country and country-rock.<ref name="CST">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jon|title=Livin' Lovin' Losin' the Louvin's Way|publisher=Country Standard Time|date=October 2003|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=943|access-date=January 22, 2010}}</ref>
 
After becoming regulars at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and scoring a string of hit singles in the late 1950s and early '60s, the Louvin Brothers broke up in 1963 due in large part to Charlie growing tired of Ira's addictions and reckless behavior. Ira died in a traffic accident in 1965. They were inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2001, and Charlie died of cancer in 2011. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the Louvin Brothers number four on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=2015-12-17|title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/4-the-louvin-brothers-67876/|access-date=2020-09-06|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Background==
Brothers [[Ira Louvin|Ira]] (April 21, 1924 – June 20, 1965) and [[Charlie Louvin|Charlie]] (July 7, 1927 – January 26, 2011) Louvin (''né'' Loudermilk) adopted the name Louvin Brothers in the 1940s as they began their career in gospel music. They grew up listening to and singing [[shape note]] music, which influenced the rest of their musical output.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cordelia's Dad Interviewed by Auger/Anvil |url=http://cordeliasdad.com/antiqueSite/anvilinter.html |access-date=2024-07-24 |website=cordeliasdad.com}}</ref> Their first foray into secular music was the minor hit "The Get Acquainted Waltz", recorded with [[Chet Atkins]]. Their other hits include "Cash on the Barrelhead" and "When I Stop Dreaming". They joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and stayed there until breaking up in 1963.<ref name = "Wolfe">{{cite book| last = Wolfe| first = Charles K.| title = In Close Harmony: The Story of the Louvin Brothers| publisher = Univ. Press of Mississippi| year = 1996| url = https://archive.org/details/incloseharmonyst00char | url-access = registration| page = [https://archive.org/details/incloseharmonyst00char/page/91 91]| isbn = 0-87805-892-3}}</ref>

Their songs were heavily influenced by their [[Baptist]] faith and warned against sin.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}   Nevertheless, Ira Louvin was notorious for his drinking, womanizing, and volcanic temper.<ref name="DimeryLydon2010"/> He was married four times; his third wife Faye shot him four times in the chest and twice in the hand after he allegedly tried to strangle her with a telephone cord.<ref>{{cite news|title='Opry' Singer Star Shot; Wife Jailed|newspaper=The Miami Herald|date=February 21, 1963|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WqAyAAAAIBAJ&dq=ira-louvin%20wife&pg=962%2C1956387|access-date=March 27, 2011}}</ref> Although seriously injured, he survived.  When performing and drinking, Ira would sometimes become angry enough on stage to smash his mandolin when he was unable to tune it, and - when sober - glue it back together. His style was heavily influenced by [[Bill Monroe]], and his brother [[Charlie Monroe]], who had a tempestuous relationship with Ira, considered him one of the top mandolin players in Nashville.<ref>{{cite book|last=Louvin|first=Charlie|title=Satan Is Real|year=2012}}</ref>

In his [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] review of Charlie's biography ''Satan Is Real'', Alex Abramovich said, "Ira Louvin was a full head taller than his younger brother, played the mandolin like Bill Monroe, and sang in an impossibly high, tense, quivering tenor. Charlie strummed a guitar, grinned like a [[vaudevillian]], and handled the bottom register. But every so often, in the middle of a song, some hidden signal flashed and the brothers switched places — with Ira swooping down from the heights, and Charlie angling upward — and even the most careful listeners would lose track of which man was carrying the lead. This was more than close-harmony singing; each instance was an act of [[transubstantiation]]."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/satan-is-real-the-story-of-the-louvin-brothers.html | work=The New York Times | first=Alex | last=Abramovich | title='Satan Is Real,' the Story of the Louvin Brothers | date=February 17, 2012}}</ref>

In 1963, fed up with Ira's drinking and abusive behavior, Charlie started a solo career,<ref name="DimeryLydon2010"/> and Ira also went on his own.

Ira died on June 20, 1965, at the age of 41. His fourth wife, Anne Young, and he were on the way home from a performance in [[Kansas City]] when they came to a section of construction on Highway 70 outside of [[Williamsburg, Missouri]], where traffic had been reduced down to one lane. A drunken driver struck their car head-on, and both Ira and Anne were killed instantly.<ref>{{cite news | last = Strauss| first = Neil | title = The Pop Life| newspaper = New York Times| date = November 28, 1996| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/28/arts/the-pop-life-500887.html?pagewanted=1| access-date = January 22, 2010}}</ref> At the time, a warrant for Ira's arrest had been issued on a [[DUI]] charge.

Charlie died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on January 26, 2011, at age 83.

==Legacy==
Country-rock band [[The Byrds]] recorded the Louvin-penned "The Christian Life" for their 1968 release ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]''.<ref name = "Wolfe" />

[[Emmylou Harris]] had a hit with the brothers' tune "[[If I Could Only Win Your Love]]" in 1975. Her cover version reached number four on the [[Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks|''Billboard ''Hot Country Singles]] chart and earned the top spot on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Music Friday: Emmylou Harris Would 'Proudly Wear Your Wedding Ring' If She Could Only Win Your Love |url=https://thejewelerblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/music-friday-emmylou-harris-would-proudly-wear-your-wedding-ring-if-she-could-only-win-your-love/ |website=The Jeweler Blog |date=August 3, 2017 |access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref>

Although the brothers are still remembered today for their musical talent, they are also remembered for the unusual cover used for their 1959 album, ''Satan Is Real''. Designed by Ira Louvin, the cover features the brothers standing in a rock [[quarry]] in front of a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} plywood rendition of the [[Devil]] as several hidden tires soaked in kerosene burn behind them as fire and brimstone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stein |first=Lorin |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/exegesis/satan-is-real/ |title=KtB – Satan Is Real |publisher=Killingthebuddha.com |date=2006-06-06 |access-date=2012-06-24}}</ref> Some reviewers count this as being one of the "greatest iconic album covers of all time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2006/12/13/the-louvin-brothers-satan-is-real/ |title=MP3 Blog, Music Blog » The Louvin Brothers :: Satan Is Real |publisher=Aquarium Drunkard |date=2006-12-13 |access-date=2012-06-24}}</ref>

The opening bars of the album's title track "Satan Is Real" can be heard at the beginning of [[Hank Williams III]]'s "Medley: Straight to Hell / Satan Is Real", on his ''[[Straight to Hell (album)|Straight to Hell]]'' album of 2006.

'''The Seldom Scene''' is an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band that formed in 1971 in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].<ref name=enc>{{cite book|author=Paul Kingsbury|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsiL49XFbnkC&pg=PA475|date=5 November 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-984044-1|pages=475–}}</ref> The band's original line-up comprised [[John Starling (musician)|John Starling]] on lead vocals and guitar, [[Mike Auldridge]] on [[Dobro]] and baritone vocals, [[Ben Eldridge]] on [[banjo]], [[Tom Gray (bluegrass musician)|Tom Gray]] on [[double bass]], and [[John Duffey]] on [[mandolin]]; the latter three also provided backing vocals. Together they released their debut studio album, ''[[Act I (Seldom Scene album)|Act I]]'', in 1972, followed by both ''[[Act Two (The Seldom Scene album)|Act II]]'' and ''[[Act III (The Seldom Scene album)|Act III]]'' in 1973.

In 1977, Starling left the group and was replaced by singer-songwriter Phil Rosenthal. Starling and Rosenthal shared lead vocals on the group's sixth studio album, ''[[Baptizing (album)|Baptizing]]'', released in 1978. Around the same time, the group switched record labels from [[Rebel Records]] to [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. In 1986, Rosenthal and Gray left the band, and were replaced by [[Lou Reid]] and [[T. Michael Coleman]], respectively; Reid and Coleman first appeared on the band's 1988 album ''[[A Change of Scenery]]''. Reid left the band in 1992, and Starling briefly returned to the group, performing on their 1994 album ''[[Like We Used to Be]]''. Starling was replaced by [[Moondi Klein]] as the band's lead singer.

During 1995 and 1996, Klein, Coleman, and Auldridge, left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called [[Chesapeake (band)|Chesapeake]]. Duffey and Eldridge recruited guitarist Fred Travers, bassist Ronnie Simpkins, and guitarist and singer [[Dudley Connell]] into the Seldom Scene, and together released the album ''[[Dream Scene]]'' in 1996. That same year, Duffey died of a [[heart attack]]. Reid returned to the band to replace Duffey on mandolin, and the group released the album ''[[Scene It All]]'' in 2000. The group's 2007 album ''[[Scenechronized]]'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]]. The band's original members (Auldridge, Duffey, Eldridge, Gray, and Starling) were inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] in 2014.

After playing for six weeks at a small Washington, D.C., club called the Rabbit's Foot, the group found a home at the Red Fox Inn in Bethesda, Maryland.<ref name="Country Music Encyclopedia"/> They performed at that venue Friday nights from January 1972 through September 1977 before starting weekly performances at the Birchmere music hall.<ref name="IBMA Scene at Red Fox">{{cite news |last=Barrett |first=Randy |url=https://ibma.org/files/Seldom%20Scene%20oct.pdf |title=Seldom Scene Returns to the Red Fox Inn |work=[[International Bluegrass Music Association]] |date=2013-10-20 |access-date=2017-05-10 |archive-date=2018-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101135552/https://ibma.org/files/Seldom%20Scene%20oct.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Rise to popularity (1972–1976)===
The [[progressive bluegrass]] style played by the Seldom Scene had become increasingly popular during the 1970s, especially Duffey's high tenor and the vocal blend of Duffey/Starling/Auldridge.<ref name=enc /> Their weekly shows included bluegrass versions of country music, rock, and even classical pop.<ref name=enc /> The band's popularity soon forced them to play more than once a week<ref name=enc /> —but they continued to maintain their image as being seldom seen, and on several of their early album covers were photographed with the stage lights on only their feet, or with their backs to the camera. Though the Scene remained a non-touring band, they were prolific recorders, producing seven albums in their first five years of existence, including one live album (among the first live bluegrass albums).<ref name="Allmusic Scene discography">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-seldom-scene-mn0000899131/discography |title=The Seldom Scene - Discography |work=AllMusic - The Seldom Scene discography |access-date=2017-05-10 |archive-date=2017-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108062835/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-seldom-scene-mn0000899131/discography |url-status=live }}</ref>

===John Starling's departure and Phil Rosenthal as lead singer (1977–1986)===
In 1977, John Starling left the group to focus on his medical career, and was replaced by singer and songwriter Phil Rosenthal, whose song "Muddy Water" had been recorded by the Scene on two earlier albums. Starling and Rosenthal shared their lead vocals on the group's sixth studio album, ''[[Baptizing (album)|Baptizing]]'' (recorded in 1978). Around the same time, the group switched record labels from [[Rebel Records|Rebel]] to [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill]]. Starling recorded a solo album for Sugar Hill in 1980 called "Long Time Gone" and another in 1982 called "Waitin' On a Southern Train", on both of which Mike Auldridge played.

The lineup of Rosenthal-Duffey-Gray-Auldridge-Eldridge recorded five albums of a comparable popularity to the ones with the founding members, including John Starling. Rosenthal proved to be as good lead singer as Starling and his baritone voice contrasted well with Duffey's high tenor extravaganzas. He also wrote typically two to three songs on each of the albums and also added acoustic guitar solos to the group.<ref>{{Citation |title=Act Four - The Seldom Scene {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/act-four-mw0000646266 |access-date=2024-07-11 |language=en |archive-date=2023-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231104151257/https://www.allmusic.com/album/act-four-mw0000646266 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===More changes in lineup (1986–1996)===
In 1986, Phil Rosenthal and Tom Gray both left the band to focus on other pursuits, and were replaced by [[Lou Reid]] and [[T. Michael Coleman]], respectively. Coleman proved to be very controversial, as many purists objected to his use of an electric bass in what is nominally an acoustic genre, but the albums produced by the band after Coleman's arrival maintained the traditional appeal of any of the Scene's earlier albums.

Reid left the band in 1992, and Duffey convinced former member John Starling to return to the band for the next year.<ref name="allbook">{{Cite book |last1=Bogdanov |first1=Vladimir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0VRvgAACAAJ |title=All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music |last2=Woodstra |first2=Chris |last3=Erlewine |first3=Stephen Thomas |date=2003 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=978-0-87930-760-8 |pages=679 |language=en |access-date=2024-07-11 |archive-date=2024-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711132848/https://books.google.ca/books/about/All_Music_Guide_to_Country.html?id=H0VRvgAACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y |url-status=live }}</ref> During that year the Scene recorded the album ''[[Like We Used to Be (album)|Like We Used to Be]]'', but Starling did not wish to stay with the band long term. He was replaced in 1994 by lead singer [[Moondi Klein]].<ref name=enc />

Throughout these changes, band leader John Duffey's original plan of keeping a light touring schedule and staying close to home continued to prevail. During 1995 and 1996, Klein and Coleman, along with original member [[Mike Auldridge]], wanting to be part of a full-time project, left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called [[Chesapeake (band)|Chesapeake]].<ref name=allbook /> For a time the Scene stopped recording.

Duffey and Eldridge, the two remaining original members, recruited resophonic guitar player Fred Travers, bassist Ronnie Simpkins, and guitarist and singer [[Dudley Connell]] to join the band, and the reconstituted group recorded an album in 1996 and continued live appearances.<ref name=allbook /><ref>Carlin, Richard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LluEHF1oT-wC&dq=%22seldom+scene%22&pg=PA183 ''Folk''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711133012/https://books.google.com/books?id=LluEHF1oT-wC&dq=%22seldom+scene%22&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q=%22seldom%20scene%22&f=false |date=2024-07-11 }}. Infobase Publishing, 2005, p. 185.</ref>

===John Duffey's death, return of Lou Reid, and ''Scene It All'' (2000–2006)===
In late 1996, band leader and founder John Duffey suffered a fatal heart attack.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-02-24 |title=MUSICIAN JOHN DUFFEY DIES |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1996/12/11/musician-john-duffey-dies/26bc449d-b3ac-4fa6-8f60-ce9fc2bfcbba/ |access-date=2024-07-11 |newspaper=Washington Post |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |archive-date=2019-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228161150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1996/12/11/musician-john-duffey-dies/26bc449d-b3ac-4fa6-8f60-ce9fc2bfcbba/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Banjoist Ben Eldridge, the sole remaining original member of the Seldom Scene, assumed leadership of the band. Former guitarist Lou Reid rejoined the band, replacing Duffey on mandolin.<ref name=allbook /> Initially the new Scene concentrated on live performances, but in 2000 the group recorded a new album, ''[[Scene It All]]''. The Seldom Scene continues to tour, and has recorded for the Sugar Hill Records and Smithsonian Folkways labels.

===''Scenechronized'', ''Long Time... Seldom Scene'', and ''Changes'' (2007–present)===
[[File:Seldom Scene Bluegrass Festival 2008.jpg|thumb|Seldom Scene playing at the Rivercity Bluegrass Festival in 2008.]]
Seldom Scene continues to perform and has received critical acclaim for their work. ''[[Scenechronized]]'', recorded in 2007, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]].<ref>{{Cite web |date= |title=GRAMMY.com - 50th Annual GRAMMY Awards Nominations List |url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213193757/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx |archive-date=2007-12-13 |access-date= |website=www.grammy.com}}</ref>

In July 2008, Seldom Scene performed at a [[White House]] dinner honoring the [[2008 U.S. Olympic team]] as well as previous U.S. Olympians.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaopAQAAIAAJ&q=%22seldom+scene%22+white+house |title=Bluegrass Unlimited |date=2008 |publisher=Bluegrass Unlimited. |volume=42 |language=en |access-date=2023-03-14 |archive-date=2024-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711132838/https://books.google.com/books?id=zaopAQAAIAAJ&q=%22seldom+scene%22+white+house |url-status=live }}</ref> Seldom Scene also played the [[National Folk Festival (USA)|National Folk Festival]] July 11–13, 2008, representing bluegrass music.

On April 22, 2014, the band returned with ''[[Long Time... Seldom Scene]]'', via Smithsonian Folkways. The collection features interpretations of 16 oft-requested tunes and is the band's first studio album since the ''Scenechronized'' in 2007. In 2015, "Long Time...Seldom Scene" and "Mean Mother Blues" won awards in the "Bluegrass" Album and Song categories at The 14th Annual Independent Music Awards.

In January 2016, Ben Eldridge retired after 44 continuous years with the band. He was replaced by Rickie Simpkins.<ref name=BE-bgrtoday-2016>{{cite web|url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/ben-eldridge-retires-from-seldom-scene/|title=Ben Eldridge Retires from Seldom Scene|work=Bluegrass Today|access-date=March 24, 2018|author=David Morris|date=January 15, 2016|archive-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324162453/https://bluegrasstoday.com/ben-eldridge-retires-from-seldom-scene/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2019, the Seldom Scene released the album ''Changes'', featuring songs by songwriters of the 1960s and early 1970s, through Rounder Records.<ref name=RS-bgrtoday-2019>{{cite web|url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/everybodys-talkin-from-seldom-scene/|title=Everybody's Talkin' from Seldom Scene|work=Bluegrass Today|access-date=April 30, 2019|author=John Lawless|date=April 4, 2019|archive-date=April 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430115035/https://bluegrasstoday.com/everybodys-talkin-from-seldom-scene/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The band currently consists of Dudley Connell (guitar/lead vocals), Ron Stewart (banjo/fiddle/guitar), Lou Reid (mandolin/tenor vocals), Fred Travers (dobro/lead vocals), and Ronnie Simpkins (bass/baritone vocals). Ben Eldridge's son, [[Chris Eldridge|Chris]], also frequently performs with the group.

'''The Stanley Brothers''' were an American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] duo of singer-songwriters and musicians, made up of brothers [[Carter Stanley]] (August 27, 1925 – December 1, 1966) and [[Ralph Stanley]] (February 25, 1927 – June 23, 2016).<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=Colin Larkin|publisher=Guinness Publishing|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=2361/2}}</ref> Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo artist after Carter's death, from 1967 until his own death in 2016.

==Early lives==
Carter and Ralph Stanley were born on a small farm in [[Dickenson County, Virginia]]. Music was a part of their lives even in their early years, and they listened to the [[Bill Monroe|Monroe Brothers]], [[J. E. Mainer|J.&nbsp;E. Mainer's Mountaineers]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on local radio.

==Careers==
The brothers formed a band, the Lazy Ramblers, and performed as a duo on [[WJCW|WJHL]] radio in Johnson City, Tennessee.<ref name="country_music">{{cite book |title= Country Music: The Encyclopedia| edition= 3rd |last= Stambler|first= Irwin|author2=Grelun Landon |year= 2000|publisher= St. Martin's Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-312-26487-9|pages= 457–8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C|access-date= February 6, 2010}}</ref> World War II interrupted their musical career, but once both brothers returned from the United States Army, they resumed their musical pursuits. They formed their band, the Stanley Brothers and the [[Clinch Mountain Boys]], in the month of November 1946<ref>Back of 33rpm album cover "In Memory of Carter Stanley/ An Empty Mansion by The Stanley Brothers. Testimonial story by Ralph Stanley. Old Homestead Records OHCS 118.</ref> as the first band to copy the [[Bill Monroe|Monroe sound]].<ref name=mmc426>Malone, McCulloh 1975, p.&nbsp;426.</ref> Carter played guitar and sang lead, while Ralph played [[banjo]] and sang with a strong, high [[tenor]] voice. Additional members of this early band were [[Pee Wee Lambert|Darrell "Pee Wee" Lambert]] on [[mandolin]] and Bobby Sumner on [[fiddle]]. Sumner soon was replaced by [[Leslie Keith]].<ref name=r80>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;80.</ref>

On December 26, 1946, the band began performing at radio station [[WZAP|WCYB]] in Bristol, Tennessee as stalwarts of the famed ''Farm and Fun Time'' radio show.<ref name=w3>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;3.</ref> They made their recording debut in September 1947 for [[Rich-R-Tone Records]] which had been founded the year before. Their records sold well, "outselling even [[Eddy Arnold]]" regionally.<ref name=r82>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;82.</ref> Up to now, Ralph had been playing his banjo with two fingers on recordings and in concerts, but in 1948, he switched to the three-finger style (popularised by [[Earl Scruggs]]).<ref name=r84>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;84.</ref> In March 1949, the Stanley Brothers began recording for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=r87>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;87.</ref> During this time, [[Bill Monroe]] was not particularly fond of groups like the Stanley Brothers and [[Flatt & Scruggs]] who he believed "stole" his music by copying it; they were seen as "economic threats."<ref name=s88>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;88.</ref><ref name=r85>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>

Financially hard times in the early 1950s forced the brothers to take a short break in their musical career. They began working for the [[Ford Motor Company]] in Detroit. Eventually, Monroe and the Stanley Brothers became friends, and Carter performed for several months with Bill Monroe in the summer of 1951. In August 1951, Ralph was involved in a serious automobile accident that almost ended his career.<ref name=w4>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Following his recovery, Carter and Ralph reunited to front their Clinch Mountain Boys.

As bluegrass music grew less popular in the late 1950s, the Stanley Brothers moved to Live Oak, Florida and headlined the weekly ''Suwannee River Jamboree'' radio show on [[WQHL (AM)|WNER]] from 1958 to 1962. The three-hour show was also syndicated across the Southeast.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> In 1966, the brothers toured Europe, and upon returning home, they continued to perform together until Carter's death in December 1966.<ref name=w5>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;5.</ref>

Many years later, Ralph revived the Clinch Mountain Boys until his death in 2016. He performed with them through 2013. He recorded one last album in 2014, ''Side By Side'', with his son, Ralph II. Among the musicians who have played in the revived Clinch Mountain Boys were [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Larry Sparks]], [[Curly Ray Cline]], Jack Cooke, Roy Lee Centers, Charlie Sizemore, Ray Goins, and Ralph Stanley II. Ralph's career received a big boost with his prominent role on the very successful soundtrack recording of the 2000 feature film, ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', which featured the song "[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]" among others.

==Legacy==
The Stanley Brothers were inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] in 1992. In 2005, The Barter State Theatre of Virginia premiered an original stage production, ''Man of Constant Sorrow: The Story of the Stanley Brothers'', written by Dr. Douglas Pote.

The University Press of Mississippi published the first full-length biography of the Stanley Brothers, ''Lonesome Melodies: The Lives and Music of the Stanley Brothers'' by David W. Johnson, on February 1, 2013. The paperback edition was published March 1, 2014.

== History ==
The Steel Woods were cofounded by Wes Bayliss and Jason "Rowdy" Cope. Cope was the creative lead of the band as well as its [[lead guitar]]ist, songwriter and co-producer, while Bayliss is a multi-instrumentalist, lead singer and co-producer.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-02-04 |title=Hotstar: The Steel Woods Build A Career Show By Show - Pollstar News |url=https://news.pollstar.com/2019/02/04/hotstar-the-steel-woods-build-a-career-show-by-show/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Bayliss grew up in [[Woodland, Alabama]], playing music in his family's gospel band and learned to play harmonica, mandolin, and guitar. In 2007, he moved to [[Mobile, Alabama]], where he experimented further on different instruments. Cope began to learn guitar at the age of 11 in his hometown of [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. He later worked as a [[Los Angeles]]-based musician before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 2007 and joined [[Jamey Johnson]]'s band. In his nine years with Johnson, Cope co-wrote "Can't Cash My Checks" and helped Johnson make the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated "[[That Lonesome Song]]" (2008) and "[[The Guitar Song]]" (2010).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pisgahbrewing.com/shows/the-steel-woods/|title=The Steel Woods|last=Pisgah|first=Brewing|date=July 29, 2019|website=Pisgah Brewing|access-date=April 16, 2020|archive-date=April 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408015228/http://www.pisgahbrewing.com/shows/the-steel-woods/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the early days of The Steel Woods, Bayliss and Cope spent a lot of time fishing and writing what would eventually evolve into the bands first studio album, ''Straw in the Wind'' (2017) released on [[Thirty Tigers]]/Woods Music. The album featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Lindi Ortega]], and [[Brent Cobb]] also contributed as a songwriter. On June 10, 2017, it reached number 42 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/independent-albums/2017-06-09|title=Independent Albums Chart|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>

In the subsequent years, the band toured with fellow [[Southern rock]] artists [[Cody Johnson]], [[Cody Jinks]], [[Whiskey Myers]], and [[Blackberry Smoke]] as well as inspirations such as [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[Miranda Lambert]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=The Steel Woods – MoxieTalk with Kirt Jacobs |url=https://moxietalk.com/episodes/thesteelwoods/ |access-date=2020-04-16 |website=MoxieTalk |language=en-US}}</ref>

'''The Whites''' are an American [[country music]] vocal group from [[Fort Worth, Texas]], United States. They consist of sisters Sharon White and Cheryl White, and their father, Buck White. Sharon plays guitar, Cheryl is the bassist and Buck plays the mandolin. Formed in 1972, the trio has recorded multiple albums and charted multiple songs on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. They are also known as frequent collaborators of country and bluegrass musician [[Ricky Skaggs]], who is Sharon's husband.

==Overview==
The Whites consist of Sharon White (born December 17, 1953), her sister Cheryl (born January 27, 1955), and their father Buck (born December 13, 1930).<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=442/3}}</ref> Buck grew up playing music and started playing in dances wrestling arenas, auditoriums but he didn't really like that atmosphere a lot.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Weintraub |first=Boris |date=November 1981 |title=Buck White and the Down Home Folks |pages=9-13 |work=Bluegrass Unlimited}}</ref> Buck had two jobs when the sisters were growing up; a plumber by day, piano and mandolin player by night.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Henry |first=Murphy Hicks |title=Pretty Good for a Girl: Women in Bluegrass |publisher=University of Illinois |year=2013 |isbn=9780252095887 |pages=157-159}}</ref> He started really enjoying music when his family started playing together all around the world. In the beginning, Sharon took up bass when she was twelve, moving to guitar when Cheryl took over on bass.<ref name=":0" /> 

In the 1980s, they scored such hits as "You Put The Blue In Me", "Hangin' Around", "Give Me Back That Old Familiar Feeling", "Pins And Needles", "If It Ain't Love (Let's Leave It Alone)", "Hometown Gossip", and "When The New Wears Off of Our Love".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

In August 1981,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrightforyou.com/offstage2.html|title=Offstage|date=March 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306020610/http://www.wrightforyou.com/offstage2.html|access-date=August 11, 2021|archive-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> Sharon White married [[Ricky Skaggs]], who performed on several of the Whites' early releases.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1987, the couple released the hit song, "Love Can't Ever Get Better Than This".

In 1991, the Whites joined producers [[Randall Franks]] and [[Alan Autry]] on the ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV Series)|In The Heat Of The Night]]'' TV series album entitled ''Christmas Time's A Comin''', performing on the track, "Let's Live Everyday Like It Was Christmas" (Sonlite/MGM/UA).

The Whites became members of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1984 and were current regulars on the program in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  Their collaborative album with Ricky Skaggs, "Salt of the Earth" won the 2008 [[Grammy]] for Best Southern/Country/Bluegrass Album.

The Whites can be heard on the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' soundtrack]] with the song "[[Keep on the Sunny Side]]". They also appear in ''[[Down from the Mountain]]'', the documentary of a concert given by the soundtrack artists.<ref name=":0" />

The Whites were inducted into the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]] on Saturday, August 16, 2008, in [[Carthage, Texas]].  They were inducted along with [[Buck Owens]] and [[Mickey Newbury]].

Also performing on the Grand Ole Opry with Buck, Sharon and Cheryl is Rosanna, better known as Rosie, the third of the four White sisters. She performs high harmony and occasionally does solo performance of the Mel Tillis classic "The Violet and the Rose".

'''Timothy O'Brien''' (born March 16, 1954) is an American [[country music|country]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] musician. In addition to singing, he plays guitar, [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], [[bouzouki]] and [[mandocello]]. He has released more than ten studio albums, in addition to charting a duet with [[Kathy Mattea]] entitled "The Battle Hymn of Love", a No.&nbsp;9 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts in 1990. In November 2013 he was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Tim O'Brien was born on March 16, 1954, and raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], the youngest in a family of five children. At the age of 12, he first heard a [[Bob Dylan]] record, played by his older sister [[Mollie O'Brien|Mollie]], afterwards deciding to take up music.  Throughout his teens, he taught himself to play guitar, [[fiddle|violin]], and [[mandolin]].

In high school, he and his sister Mollie, a singer, began performing [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]] songs as a duo at church and local coffeehouses.<ref name="bio"/>

== Music career ==

=== Hot Rize ===
[[File:Hot Rize-by Eric Frommer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hot Rize in 2004: [[Pete Wernick]], [[eTown|Nick Forster]], Tim O'Brien, [[Bryan Sutton]]]]
In 1973, he dropped out of [[Colby College]] to pursue music professionally.  He wrote to his mother at the time, saying, "I'm heading west.  I know 200 songs now, and I figure if I keep learning more I should be all right."

He eventually moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], in the 1970s and became part of the music scene there. He played bars around Denver and Boulder with Dan Sadowsky and the Ophelia Swing Band and cut one of his earliest albums, Swing Tunes of the 30's and 40's, with that band in 1977.  In [[Colorado]], he met guitarist/bassist [[Charles Sawtelle]], banjoist [[Pete Wernick]], and guitarist Mike Scap, with whom he formed [[Hot Rize]] in 1978. Mike Scap was soon replaced by Nick Forster on bass with Sawtelle moving to guitar. Over the next twelve years, the quartet earned recognition as one of America's most innovative and entertaining bluegrass bands. Never straying too far from a traditional sound, Hot Rize stood out with fresh harmony singing, Wernick's melodic banjo playing, and O'Brien's easy-going rhythmic drive.

To broaden their repertoire, the members of Hot Rize would often split their show with a set of classic and offbeat country and western music in the comic guise of Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers.<ref name="Official Website">{{cite web |url=http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |title=Tim O'Brien - Welcome |access-date=February 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313073415/http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |archive-date=March 13, 2008 }} Official Website</ref> The band would walk off stage, change clothes, and reappear as a different band (O'Brien assumed the role of "Red Knuckles"), with its own songs, fictional back story and humorous costumes. Hot Rize was the International Bluegrass Music Association's first Entertainer of the Year in 1990, and in 1993, O'Brien took the IBMA's Male Vocalist of the Year honors.

In 1990, Hot Rize disbanded as a regular touring and recording band.  However, after the death of guitarist Charles Sawtelle, in 2002 Hot Rize was joined by award winning guitarist Bryan Sutton and the band began to once again play limited engagements.

=== Duets with Mollie O'Brien ===
{{Listen
|filename=OrphanGirl.ogg
|title="Orphan Girl"
|description=Sample of "Orphan Girl" off ''Away Out on the Mountain'' with Tim and Mollie O'Brien (1994)
|format=[[Ogg]]}}In 1984, O'Brien and his sister [[Mollie O'Brien]] reunited for a Mother's Day concert, and four years later recorded the duet album ''Take Me Back''.<ref name="all"/> Chip Renner of [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4.5/5 stars, and called it "a masterpiece."<ref name="renner"/> In 1986 they began performing again as an Americana duo, and produced two more albums, ''Remember Me'' (1992), and ''Away Out on the Mountain'' (1994). All three records were released on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]].<ref name="fame"/>

=== Solo career ===
O'Brien, who had already recorded several albums without Hot Rize, embarked on a solo career.  He briefly signed to [[RCA Records]], recording an album with them called "Odd Man In", before being dropped. [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]] eventually released the album, and O'Brien has not signed to a major since. In 1990, O'Brien also charted along with [[Kathy Mattea]] on the duet "The Battle Hymn of Love", which peaked at No.&nbsp;9 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/|title=Billboard – Music Charts, News, Photos & Video|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

In 2010, O'Brien featured prominently on [[Kris Drever]]'s second solo album, ''Mark the Hard Earth''.  He also produced at least one instructional video/DVD of mandolin and bouzouki instruments.

O'Brien joined Mark Knopfler in his Get Lucky Tour between April 8, 2010 and July 31, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.markknopflersworld.com/get-lucky-tour.html | title=Get Lucky Tour - Mark Knopfler's World }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdKEZWTCfQM | title=Working for Mark Knopfler | website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>

=== Howdy Skies Records ===
O'Brien started his own record label, [[Howdy Skies Records]], in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timobrien.net/bio |website=Timobrien.net|title=Bio : Tim O'Brien Band (short version) |date=2019| access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>

== Style and sound ==
{{blockquote|I wanted to do the whole spectrum of folk music from one guy singing and playing guitar or fiddle to a full band with electric guitar," O'Brien said. And that's how the pair (of albums) came out, like folk music bookends. Fiddler's Green tends toward the intimate and traditional, while Cornbread Nation is a bit funkier and tempo-driven. On both, however, old-time tunes sit comfortably next to originals and a few classic country songs by the likes of Jimmie Rodgers and Harlan Howard. I could have taken all traditional songs, but I love stuff like "California Blues" and "Busted," which are like folk songs to me, and they fit with the others, and it shows that what is called country music is just another footstep down the same path. Rock and roll, a lot of that is the same too.<ref name="Official Website"/>}}

Although naturally left-handed, O'Brien plays the guitar and other instruments right-handed.

== Distinctions and awards ==

'''Tony Furtado''' (born October 18, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter, banjoist, and guitarist.

== History ==
[[Image:Tony Furtado 2.jpg|left|thumb|Fox Theater, Boulder, Colorado, February 8, 2008]]

==Awards and honors ==
* Won [[National Bluegrass Banjo Championship]], [[Winfield, Kansas]], 1987 and 1991

==Musical style==
Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumental-ist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef.  Comparisons to [[Ry Cooder]] were rooted in Furtado's combination of jazz, Celtic, and old-time music. On his third album, ''Full Circle'' (1994) he concentrated on acoustic blues and [[slide guitar]], with Cooder as an influence.

"Furtado mixes Americana, folk, indie-rock, blues, and jazz styles."<ref>[http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=1001 "Tony Furtado goes for a lucky 'Thirteen'"] by Jason MacNeil, January 2007, ''Country Standard Time''</ref>

"As a banjo virtuoso, Furtado is well known for his envelope-pushing, progressive bluegrass stylings. His picking is rapid-fire quick, sharp and clear, and puts him in the school of Béla Fleck and [[David Grisman]]."<ref>[http://www.telluridegateway.com/articles/2007/03/09/the_pulse/pulse03.txt "Furtado brings eclectic bag of tricks to Opera House"] by Katie Klingsporn, March 8, 2007, ''Telluride Daily Planet''.</ref>

"He mixes bluegrass roots with a mainstream pop streak, easily holding the spotlight, thanks to his restrained virtuosity on acoustic and slide guitar and a warmly engaging voice reminiscent of T Bone Burnett, sans preachiness. – ''Paste'' magazine

'''Anthony Cattell Trischka''' (born January 16, 1949) is an American five-string [[banjo]] player. Sandra Brennan wrote of him in 2021: "One of the most influential modern banjoists, both in several forms of bluegrass music and occasionally in jazz and avant-garde, Tony Trischka has inspired a whole generation of progressive bluegrass musicians."<ref name=Brennan>{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Sandra |work=[[AllMusic]] |date=2021 |title=Tony Trischka Biography by Sandra Brennan |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tony-trischka-mn0000202033/biography |accessdate=2022-12-02}}</ref>

==Music career==
[[File:Bruce Molsky and Tony Trischka, New Bedford Folk Festival 2022.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bruce Molsky]] (L) and Tony Trischka at the 2022 New Bedford Folk Festival]]
A native of Syracuse, New York, Trischka's interest in banjo was sparked by [[the Kingston Trio]]'s version of "[[M.T.A. (song)|Charlie and the MTA]]" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, he made his recording debut on ''15 Bluegrass Instrumentals'' with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of America's premier sports-rock band Country Granola.

In 1973, he began a three-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, ''Bluegrass Light'' and ''Heartlands''. Ethnomusicologist Benjamin Krakauer devotes an article to the legacy of this group in the bluegrass community, described as of ''experimental bluegrass musicians from New York City'':<ref name="Krakauer">{{cite journal |last1= Krakauer|first1=Benjamin |date= Summer 2018|title=Music Scene and Its Fringes: Experimental Bluegrass of 1970s New York City |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163 |journal=American Music  |volume= 36|issue=2 |pages=163-193 |doi= 10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163|access-date=February 19, 2024}}</ref> {{Blockquote|text=Breakfast Special's innovative music incorporates jazz, avant-garde, psychedelic, klezmer, and various non- Western musical elements into their irreverent and often absurdist performances}}. This researcher explores the question of why their music has never been absorbed into the bluegrass mainstream, while the newgrass and progressive blue-grass of many of their innovative peers was widely embraced :  Benjamin Krakauer argues:<ref name="Krakauer"/> {{Blockquote|text= that breakfast Special’s eclecticism and related aesthetic choices made their music inaccessible to many bluegrass audiences and that the unfa-miliar aspects of this music and its presentation exacerbated conservative southern white audiences’ anxieties over the performers’ regional, ethnic, religious, and cultural otherness}} 
After one more solo album in 1976, ''Banjoland'', he went on to become musical leader for the Broadway show ''[[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)|The Robber Bridegroom]]''. Trischka toured with the show in 1978, the year he also played with the [[Monroe Doctrine]].
In 1978, Trischka toured Japan and recorded with [[Peter Rowan]] and [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]]. In the early 1980s, he began recording with his group Skyline, which released its first album in 1983. Later albums included ''Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas'' (solo, 1983), ''Stranded in the Moonlight'' (with Skyline, 1984) and ''Hill Country'' (solo, 1985). In 1984, he performed in his first feature film, ''[[Foxfire (1987 film)|Foxfire]]''. Three years later, he worked on the pre-recorded music for the off-Broadway production of ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' that featured Jessica Tandy and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Trischka produced the Belgian group Gold Rush's ''No More Angels'' in 1988. The following year, Skyline recorded its final album, ''Fire of Grace''. He also recorded the theme song for ''Books on the Air'', a popular [[National Public Radio]] show, and continued his affiliation with the network by appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', ''From Our Front Porch'', and other radio shows. Trischka continued his recording career with 1993's ''World Turning'', 1995's ''Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection'' and 1999's ''Bend''. ''New Deal'' followed in 2003.

''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'', featuring appearances by [[Steve Martin]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Béla Fleck]] and [[Tony Rice]], came out four years later. For this recording Trischka went back to bluegrass and reinvigorated the double banjo tradition. In October 2007, he was given an IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) award for Banjo Player of the Year 2007. ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' received IBMA awards for Recorded Event of the Year, Instrumental Album of the Year and a Grammy Nomination.

He has written over fifteen instructional books and a series of DVDs. In July 2009 he launched the groundbreaking ''Online Banjo School with Tony Trischka'', an interactive, online learning school that teaches students around the world how to play banjo with [[ArtistWorks]]. Trischka is closely associated with "newgrass," which features several innovations to traditional bluegrass, including jazzy arrangements, non-traditional chordal structures, and frequent covers of non-bluegrass songs. Trischka is one of the major innovators of the "chromatic" banjo style, which features sinewy, snaky melodic runs not strictly played out of chord positions.

2011 saw ''Give Me the Banjo'' aired on PBS stations nationwide with Trischka as the musical director and co-producer of the documentary. It was released on DVD. He produced [[Steve Martin]]'s Grammy-nominated ''Rare Bird Alert'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]]), which features performances by [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Dixie Chicks]] and the [[Steep Canyon Rangers]].

In December 2012, Trischka was awarded the United States Artists Friends Fellow in recognition of the excellence of his work.<ref>{{Cite web|title=United States Artists » Tony Trischka|url=https://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/tony-trischka/|access-date=July 11, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>

|text=Everybody always talks about the state of country music and puts down commercial country and [says] "something's gotta be done" and "we need to be elevating artists that are doing more traditional country." But then we're not calling those artists country artists, they're getting put into this Americana thing. It is what it is, and I don't really know how to define what Americana is. We're our own thing, it's a new time, and I don't know what it's called but I've been calling it country, y'know? I think, a lot of times, it's kind of become just a costume.<ref name="auto"/>

'''Vassar Carlton Clements''' (April 25, 1928<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> – August 16, 2005<ref name="Billboard"/>) was an American jazz, [[Swing music|swing]], and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]. Clements has been dubbed the Father of Hillbilly Jazz, an improvisational style that blends and borrows from swing, hot jazz, and bluegrass along with roots also in country and other musical traditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ledgin |first=Stephanie P. |date=2004 |title=Homegrown Music: Discovering Bluegrass|url=https://archive.org/details/homegrownmusicdi00step |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/homegrownmusicdi00step/page/60 60]|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=0275981150}}</ref> He was posthumously inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] in 2018.

==Biography==
{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2022}}
Clements was born in [[Kinard, Florida]]<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=83}}</ref> and grew up in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. He taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7, learning "There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor" as his first song. Soon, he joined with two first cousins, Red and Gerald, to form a local string band. In his early teens Clements met [[Bill Monroe]] and the [[Blue Grass Boys]] when they came to Florida to visit Clements' stepfather, a friend of fiddler [[Chubby Wise]]. Clements was impressed with his playing.

In late 1949, Wise left Monroe's group, and the 21 year-old Clements traveled by bus to ask for an audition. When told he would have to return the next day, Clements was crestfallen, lacking the money for either a hotel room or return bus trip. Monroe gave him some money to a night's lodging, and the next day Clements auditioned and was hired. He remained with Monroe for seven years, recording with the band in 1950 and 1951.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Between 1957 and 1962, he was a member of the [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band [[Jim and Jesse]] & the Virginia Boys.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>  He also gained recognition joining with the popular bluegrass duo of [[Flatt and Scruggs]] on the popular theme to the hit television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. [[Earl Scruggs]]' path-breaking banjo style had premiered with Bill Monroe in the late 1940s, and thereafter gained widespread renown with [[Lester Flatt]] and the Foggy Mountain Boys.

By the mid-1960s, however, his struggles with alcohol left him making his living in [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar trades]], being employed briefly at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida as a plumber, in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[paper mill]], and as switchman for [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]].  He even sold insurance and once operated a convenience store while owning a [[potato chip]] [[franchising|franchise]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Sobering up, he returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1967, where he became a much sought-after studio musician.

After a brief touring stint with [[Faron Young]] he joined [[John Hartford]]'s Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> when he met guitarist [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]] and [[Dobro]] player [[Tut Taylor]], and recorded ''[[Aereo-Plain]]'', a widely acclaimed "newgrass" album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound. After less than a year he joined up with Earl Scruggs.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

His 1972 work with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their album ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle be Unbroken]]'' earned even wider acclaim, and he later worked on the [[Grateful Dead]]'s ''[[Wake of the Flood]]'' and [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s ''[[A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean]]''.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Within the next two years, Clements would cut his first solo album.

In 1973, he joined and toured with the bluegrass supergroup [[Old & In the Way]] with [[Jerry Garcia]],<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> [[David Grisman]], [[Peter Rowan]], and [[John Kahn]]; their self-titled live album ''[[Old & In the Way (album)|Old & In the Way]]'' was released in 1975.
[[File:Vassar Clements, Seattle, 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Clements in 1974]]
In 1974 he lent his talents to ''[[Highway Call]]'', a solo album by former [[Allman Brothers Band]] guitarist [[Dickey Betts]].
He was considered by many to be an outstanding fiddle virtuoso and he described his talent saying, {{blockquote|It was God's gift, something born in me. I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was young, with plenty of time and I didn't give up. You'd come home from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions. I don't read music. I play what I hear.}}

In his 50-year career he played with artists ranging from [[Woody Herman]] and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to the Grateful Dead, [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Paul McCartney]], and earned at least five [[Grammy Award]] nominations and numerous professional accolades. He once recorded with the pop group [[the Monkees]] by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session. He also appeared in [[Robert Altman]]'s 1975 film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and [[Alan Rudolph]]'s 1976 film, ''[[Welcome to L.A.]]''. He made a duet album with [[Stéphane Grappelli]] ''Together at Last'' in 1987.

In 2004, he performed in concert with jazz quartet Third Stream – in which a video documentary of the concert was done with Jim Easton (guitar), Tom Strohman (sax), Jim Miller (bass), and John Peifer (drums).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vassarclements.com/tourdates_2004.html|title=Vassar Clements - Tour Dates 2004|website=Vassarclements.com|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref>

Though he played numerous instruments, Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, "I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out. The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle. So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle."

[[Big band]] and [[swing music]] were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, "Bands like [[Glenn Miller]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Harry James]] and [[Artie Shaw]] were very popular when I was a kid. I always loved rhythm, so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play, because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the big-band sounds I heard on my fiddle."

Vassar Clements played on over 200 albums, including nearly 40 on which he starred or was featured. His albums often featured newgrass style music and what Clements called "Hillbilly Jazz". His last album, ''Livin' With the Blues'', released in 2004, was his only blues recording; it featured guest appearances by [[Elvin Bishop]], [[Norton Buffalo]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and others.

His 2005 [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]] was for "Earl's Breakdown," by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and featured Clements, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs, and [[Jerry Douglas (musician)|Jerry Douglas]].

Clements, whose last performance was February 4, 2005 in [[Jamestown, New York|Jamestown]], [[New York (state)|New York]], died on August 16, 2005, aged 77, of lung cancer.<ref name="Billboard">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61748/bluegrass-great-vassar-clements-dies |title=Bluegrass Great Vassar Clements Dies |date=2005-08-17 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1507703/legendary-fiddler-vassar-clements-dead-at-age-77/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713205822/http://www.cmt.com/news/1507703/legendary-fiddler-vassar-clements-dead-at-age-77/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2019 |title=Legendary Fiddler Vassar Clements Dead at Age 77 |last=Gilbert |first=Calvin |date=2005-08-16 |website=CMT News |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/20050817130351719 |title=World Music Central - Legendary Fiddler Vassar Clements Dies at 77 |date=2005-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110110716/http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/20050817130351719 |archive-date=2005-11-10 |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>

'''Vernon Gosdin''' (August 5, 1934<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=163/4}}</ref> – April 28, 2009)<ref name="Obit"/> aka Country music's "The Voice", was an American [[country music]] [[singing|singer]]. He had 19 top-10 solo hits on the country music charts from 1977 through 1990. Three of these hits went to Number One: "[[I Can Tell By the Way You Dance (You're Gonna Love Me Tonight)]]", "[[Set 'Em Up Joe]]", and "[[I'm Still Crazy]]".<ref name="jw40">Whitburn, Joel (1996). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits'', p.129-130. {{ISBN|0-8230-7632-6}}.</ref>

==Career==
===Early years===
As the sixth child in a family of nine,<ref name="jw1-575">Whitburn, Joel (1991). ''The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits'', p.575. {{ISBN|0-8230-7553-2}}.</ref> Vern Gosdin began singing in Bethel East Baptist Church in his birth place of [[Woodland, Alabama]], United States,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> where his mother played piano. Gosdin and two brothers sang gospel on [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] radio station [[WJOX (AM)|WVOK]].<ref name="jw1-575"/> Gosdin later moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he operated the D&G Tap. He idolized [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[The Blue Sky Boys]] as a young man.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===1960s: West Coast Country music movement===
In 1961, Gosdin moved to California, where he joined the West Coast Country music movement, first as a member of the Golden State Boys,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> which became [[The Hillmen]], and included [[Chris Hillman]].<ref name="jw1-575"/> Gosdin then formed The Gosdin Brothers with brother Rex. The duo appeared on the charts in the late 1960s with a song titled "Hangin' On" on the Bakersfield International label, then with "Till The End" on Capitol Records. During the same time period, the Gosdin Brothers were featured on Hillman's former [[Byrds]] mate [[Gene Clark]]'s first solo album, the 1967 well-regarded ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]'',<ref name="LarkinCountry" /> singing backing vocals on all of the tracks behind the lead vocals of Clark and lead guitars of Clarence White, Glen Campbell, and Bill Rinehart (later of the Merry-Go-Round).

===1970s: Retirement and comeback===
Gosdin retired from performing during the 1970s and moved to Cartersville, Georgia, where he operated a glass company.<ref name="jw1-575"/> In 1976, he signed with [[Elektra Records]] and his first hit was a remake of "Hangin' On", which featured [[Emmylou Harris]] on harmony vocals and peaked at No.&nbsp;16.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His next single, "Yesterday's Gone" written by Wayne Hinsen Bradford who also wrote for Emmylou Harris, which also featured Harris, became his first Top 10 hit in 1977.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Several more hits followed between 1977 and 1979 with the biggest of these hits being a remake of "Till the End" and a cover of [[The Association]]'s "[[Never My Love]]" which also featured harmony vocals from [[Janie Frickie]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

===1981–1983: "Today My World Slipped Away"===
In 1981, Gosdin signed with [[Ovation Records]] and scored a Top 10 hit with "Dream of Me". After Ovation Records closed their doors later in 1981, Gosdin signed with A.M.I. Records where he scored a Top 10 hit in 1982 with "Today My World Slipped Away". (This song later became a number-three hit for [[George Strait]]).

In January 1982, during a trial that examined the attempted assassination of music producer [[Gary S. Paxton]], Darryl C. Langley claimed under oath that he and his cohort were hired attackers employed by Gosdin, who worked closely with Paxton and was alleged to be disgruntled in their working relationship. Gosdin was never arrested or charged and repeatedly refused to confirm or deny involvement for the remainder of his life.

Gosdin signed with Complete Records in the early 1980s, and, in 1984, released ''There Is A Season'', picked by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as best country album of the year.
The early 1980s also found a great combination of talent as Gosdin traveled from coast to coast opening shows for George Jones.

===1983–1985: "If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)"' and ''There Is a Season''===
Gosdin made the top 10 consistently in the early 1980s, really hitting his stride when he teamed with Barnes as a songwriting collaborator. The pair specialized in songs of cheating and barroom romance, often delivering an over-the-top emotionalism that got Gosdin compared to [[George Jones]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> In 1983, Gosdin had two top 5 hits — "If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)" and "Way Down Deep" with the former earning him a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.]] The following year, he had his first No.&nbsp;1 single with "I Can Tell by the Way You Dance (You're Gonna Love Me Tonight)",<ref name="jw40"/> which had previously been recorded by [[Gary Morris]].<ref name="jw1-575"/> On September 22, 1985, Gosdin appeared at the original Farm Aid concert at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium.

===1987–1989: "Chiseled in Stone"===
After Compleat Records went bankrupt, Gosdin signed with Columbia in 1987. He immediately had success with "Do You Believe Me Now", and scored another No.&nbsp;1 hit with a tribute to [[Ernest Tubb]] called "Set 'Em Up Joe".<ref name="jw40"/> Gosdin's "[[Chiseled in Stone]]", co-written with Barnes, won the Country Music Association's Song of the Year award in 1989 and earned them a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]].

===1989–1990: ''Alone''===
Gosdin's 1989 album, ''Alone'', was a concept album in a traditional country style. It chronicled the dissolution of Gosdin's marriage and included his final number-one hit: "I'm Still Crazy".<ref name="jw40"/> From 1989 to 1991, he released a number of songs and three more made the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' top 10: "Right in the Wrong Direction", "That Just About Does It" and "Is It Raining at Your House". "Raining" has been covered by [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Lorrie Morgan]], and "That Just About Does It" by [[Willie Nelson]].

===Later years===
Gosdin suffered a stroke in 1998, but he continued writing and singing up until his death. In 2009, Gosdin collaborated with Joe Sins of the country music duo The Sins to write and record his final four songs.

==Death==
Gosdin suffered another stroke in early April 2009, and died at a Nashville hospital on the evening of April 28 at the age of 74.<ref name="Obit">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510233623/http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2015|title=Singer-Songwriter Vern Gosdin Dies in Nashville at Age 74|first=Calvin|last=Gilbert|website=CMT News|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> His remains were buried at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] in Nashville, Tennessee.

'''Vincent Grant Gill''' (born April 12, 1957) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He began in a number of local [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands in the 1970s, and from 1978 to 1982, he achieved his first mainstream attention as lead singer of the [[soft rock]] band [[Pure Prairie League]]. Gill sang lead on their hit single "[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]" in addition to writing several songs of theirs. After leaving Pure Prairie League, Gill briefly played guitar in [[Rodney Crowell]]'s backing band [[the Cherry Bombs]] before beginning a solo career in [[country music]] in 1984. Gill recorded for [[RCA Records Nashville]] from then until 1988 with minimal success. A year later he signed with [[MCA Nashville]], and he has recorded for this label ever since.

His commercial peak came in the first half of the 1990s, starting with his breakthrough album ''[[When I Call Your Name (album)|When I Call Your Name]]''. Gill has 65 entries on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including four solo number one hits: "[[I Still Believe in You (Vince Gill song)|I Still Believe in You]]", "[[Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away]]", "[[One More Last Chance]]", and "[[Tryin' to Get Over You]]", all between 1992 and 1994. He has also had number-one singles as a guest on [[Reba McEntire]]'s "[[The Heart Won't Lie]]" in 1993, as well as [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]]'s "[[Sober Saturday Night]]" and the multi-artist collaboration "[[Forever Country]]", both in 2016. All of Gill's albums released in the 1990s were certified platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), with the highest being 1992's ''[[I Still Believe in You (album)|I Still Believe in You]]'' at quintuple-platinum. Gill has won 22 [[Grammy Awards]], the most among solo male country music artists.

Gill was a member of [[Western swing]] group [[the Time Jumpers]] from 2010 to 2020, and joined the rock band [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] in 2017 following the death of longtime member [[Glenn Frey]]. He has also participated in a variety of collaborations, including songs by [[Patty Loveless]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], and [[Maren Morris]]. From 1980 to 1997 he was married to Janis Oliver, one-half of the country duo [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]]; after they divorced, he married [[contemporary Christian music]] singer [[Amy Grant]] in 2000. Additionally, Gill has written songs for [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] and [[Ty Herndon]], and holds a number of credits as a backing vocalist and session musician.

Gill's music is known for his songwriting, his [[tenor]] singing voice, and his lead guitar work, with many critics noting his prolificacy in both ballads and up-tempo material. In addition to guitar, Gill plays [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], and [[Dobro]]. He has been referred to as the "nicest guy in Nashville" due to his pleasant mannerisms and frequent contributions to charity.

==Music career==
===Early 1980s: Pure Prairie League and the Cherry Bombs===
In 1978, [[soft rock]] band [[Pure Prairie League]] was auditioning new lead singers after their previous vocalist Larry Goshorn departed. Gill attended the auditions at the recommendation of a friend, as he had served as an opening act for the band while in Mountain Smoke.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=51}} By October 1978, Gill had begun performing in concert as guitarist and vocalist for Pure Prairie League.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/128476775/ | title=Willie Nelson: A different kind of country | work=[[The Des Moines Register]] | date=October 17, 1978 | accessdate=March 25, 2024 | author=Jim Healey | pages=8A}}</ref> He appeared on their 1979 album ''[[Can't Hold Back (Pure Prairie League album)|Can't Hold Back]]'' in addition to writing several songs on it.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/cant-hold-back-mw0000052071 | title=''Can't Hold Back'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 11, 2024}}</ref> During Gill's tenure as lead vocalist, the band had a top-ten hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with "[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]";{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=52}}<ref name="encyclopedia"/> he also wrote its follow-up "I'm Almost Ready",<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyQEAAAAMBAJ | title=Top single picks | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | pages=67 | date=August 16, 1980}}</ref> as well as five other songs on the corresponding album ''[[Firin' Up]]''.

Another member of the Cherry Bombs, keyboardist and record producer [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], became the president of [[artists and repertoire]] at [[RCA Records Nashville]] in 1983. As Gill wanted to become a solo artist, Brown recommended him to [[Joe Galante]], then an executive of the same label, who signed him that same year.{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=57-60}} Shortly before his signing with RCA, Gill also appeared as a guest vocalist on [[David Grisman]]'s ''[[Here Today (David Grisman album)|Here Today]]'',<ref name="allmusic"/> and sang backing vocals on [[Steve Wariner]]'s "[[Midnight Fire (song)|Midnight Fire]]", on which Brown was a producer.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Archive-RandR/1980s/1983/RR-1983-07-29.pdf | title=Nashville this week: CMA talent seminar set | author=Sharon Allen | journal=[[Radio & Records]] | pages=39 | date=July 29, 1983}}</ref>

Gill debuted on RCA in 1984 with a six-song [[extended play]] titled ''[[Turn Me Loose (EP)|Turn Me Loose]]''.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=61}} The project accounted for three singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: "Victim of Life's Circumstances", "Oh Carolina", and the title track, all of which peaked just within the top 40.{{Sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} [[Delbert McClinton]] wrote the former of these, while Gill wrote the title track. The album was produced by [[Emory Gordy Jr.]], also a member of the Cherry Bombs at the time.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=51}} Despite the minimal success of ''Turn Me Loose'', Gill won Top New Male Vocalist from the [[Academy of Country Music]] in 1984.<ref name="acm">{{cite web | url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners?awardTitle=vince+gill&awardCategory=&awardYear=&actionButton=Submit | title=Search results for Vince Gill | publisher=[[Academy of Country Music]] | accessdate=March 31, 2024}}</ref> Word of mouth within the Nashville community towards Gill's extended play also led to him serving as a backing vocalist and [[session musician]] for a number of other country singers. He served in this capacity for [[Conway Twitty]] and [[Lee Greenwood]],{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=63-64}} in addition to providing backing vocals on Rosanne Cash's 1985 album ''[[Rhythm & Romance (Rosanne Cash album)|Rhythm & Romance]]''.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=66}}

After ''Turn Me Loose'', Gill performed a number of shows at Nashville's [[Bluebird Café]], a popular venue for songwriters, as a means of refining his own songwriting.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=64}} His first full album for RCA was 1985's ''[[The Things That Matter]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> While the lead single "True Love" underperformed on the country charts, the follow-up "[[If It Weren't for Him]]" (a duet with Cash) became Gill's first top-ten country hit the same year. The song was originally to have been included on ''Turn Me Loose'', but was delayed until ''The Things That Matter'' due to legal complications between Gill's and Cash's labels.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=66}} The album accounted for another top-ten in "[[Oklahoma Borderline]]",{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} which Gill wrote with Crowell and [[Guy Clark]].{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=65-66}} The last single, "With You", was less successful.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} To promote the album, Gill began touring as an opening act for Ricky Skaggs.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=67}}

Author Jo Sgammato stated that while Gill's first two projects for RCA were not commercially successful, both were well-received by music critics and fans.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=71}} For his third RCA release, ''[[The Way Back Home]]'' (1987), Gill intentionally wanted to choose a new producer to vary his sound. He selected [[Richard Landis]], whom he also allowed to select material for the album. In addition, Landis allowed Gill to play mandolin, banjo, and Dobro as well as guitar.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=71-73}} Crowell provided backing vocals, as did [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]], a duo consisting of Gill's then-wife Janis and her sister Kristine.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=74}} ''The Way Back Home'' produced four singles. First was "[[Cinderella (Vince Gill song)|Cinderella]]", written by [[Reed Nielsen]], which peaked at number five on the country charts in 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} The album's second and third singles "[[Let's Do Something]]" and "[[Everybody's Sweetheart (song)|Everybody's Sweetheart]]" were both top-20 hits, but the final single "The Radio" stopped at number 39 on the country charts.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} After this album, Gill ended his contract with RCA as Galante wanted him to record only songs by other writers. Despite this disagreement, Gill stated that he left RCA amicably and still considered Galante a friend.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=89-90}} During Gill's departure from RCA, [[Dire Straits]] guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]] invited Gill to join the band on their then-upcoming world tour, but Gill declined as he wanted to stay within country music.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=77-78}}

===1989{{Ndash}}1992: Early years with MCA Nashville===

After this song, Gill provided duet vocals on Reba McEntire's number-one single "[[The Heart Won't Lie]]",<ref name="allmusic"/> on which Brown was also a producer. She had originally intended to record the song with [[Kenny Rogers]], but after proving unable to find a key in which both of them could sing the song comfortably, she instead chose Gill.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://uk.style.yahoo.com/reba-mcentire-always-feel-terrible-215721198.html | title=Reba McEntire will always feel terrible about scrapping Kenny Rogers duet plans | publisher=Yahoo! | date=June 18, 2021 | accessdate=April 18, 2024}}</ref> The next single off ''I Still Believe in You'' was the number three "[[No Future in the Past (Vince Gill song)|No Future in the Past]]".

Jurek noted that the project was dominated by songs about falling in love, but praised Gill's lyrics and vocals, as well as Brown's production.<ref name="make sure">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/lets-make-sure-we-kiss-goodbye-mw0000059121 | title=''Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Thom Jurek}}</ref> Nash criticized the sound of the album as "goop" and "tepid" outside the title track.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/2000/04/21/lets-make-sure-we-kiss-goodbye/ | title=Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=April 21, 2000 | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Alanna Nash}}</ref> Similarly, in a review for [[Knight Ridder]] republished in the ''[[Ventura County Star]]'', Howard Cohen panned the project for "stock sentiments and imagery" of love and "overly slick balladry".<ref name="kiss cohen">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/928396004/ | title=Listening Room | work=[[Ventura County Star]] | date=May 5, 2000 | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | pages=34}}</ref> ''Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye'' was certified gold after release.<ref name="riaa"/>

Gill did not issue another studio album until 2003's ''[[Next Big Thing]]''. He wrote its lead single and title track "[[Next Big Thing (song)|Next Big Thing]]" with John Hobbs and former [[NRBQ]] member [[Al Anderson (NRBQ)|Al Anderson]]; the song would become Gill's last solo top-20 country chart entry upon release.{{Sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} Also released from the album were the less successful singles "Someday" and "Young Man's Town".{{Sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} In a 2003 telephone interview with Country Standard Time, Gill said that many of the lyrics on ''Next Big Thing'' were inspired by his increasing age and the rise of younger artists who had surpassed him commercially in the intervening years. He also wanted the album to include more humorous material than his previous works. As Brown had stopped working for MCA at the time, this left him unavailable as a producer, so Gill produced the project by himself.<ref name="cst remz">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/print_article.asp?xid=450 | title=Vince Gill - the next big thing? | publisher=Country Standard Time | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Jeffrey B.

===2004{{ndash}}2007: The Notorious Cherry Bombs and ''These Days''===
In 2004, Gill and Rodney Crowell decided to re-establish Crowell's former backing band the Cherry Bombs after most of the members had reunited at an awards banquet for the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP). This lineup included all the former members except for bassist Emory Gordy Jr., who declined to participate, and drummer [[Larrie Londin]], who died of a heart attack in 1992. Their respective roles were taken over by session musicians [[Michael Rhodes (musician)|Michael Rhodes]] and [[Eddie Bayers]]. Crediting themselves as [[the Notorious Cherry Bombs]], this group of musicians recorded one [[The Notorious Cherry Bombs (album)|self-titled album]] for Universal South Records (now [[Show Dog-Universal Music]]) in 2004, which featured Gill and Crowell alternating as vocalists.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-notorious-cherry-bombs-mn0002319623#biography | title=The Notorious Cherry Bombs biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Jason Ankeny}}</ref> The project also charted one single on Hot Country Songs with "It's Hard to Kiss the Lips at Night That Chew Your Ass Out All Day Long".{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|page=261}}

Gill's next project for MCA was 2006's ''[[These Days (Vince Gill album)|These Days]]'', a [[box set]] comprising four albums each recorded in a different style. These were ''Workin' on a Big Chill'' for [[country rock]], ''The Reason Why'' for [[soul music]], ''Some Things Never Get Old'' for [[neotraditional country]], and ''Little Brother'' for [[bluegrass music]]. Among the guest vocalists on the album were Grant, McDonald, Loveless, Crowell, [[Del McCoury]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Diana Krall]], and [[Trisha Yearwood]]. Gill co-produced with Justin Niebank and John Hobbs, and wrote most of the songs by himself. Jurek reviewed the project favorably on AllMusic, highlighting the stylistic and lyrical diversity; he concluded his review by stating that the project was "an exhaustive, profound, fun and fulfilling set that not only gives fans something to delight in, but goes wide and if given half a chance could and would attract many new ones."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/these-days-mw0000402550 | title=''These Days'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Thom Jurek}}</ref> Scott Jordan of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' panned the songs on ''The Reason Why'' but compared the tracks on ''Workin' on a Big Chill'' favorably to [[Delbert McClinton]] and praised the introspective lyrics in some of the tracks on ''Little Brother''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2006-12-08/426573/ | title=Vince Gill{{Mdash}}''These Days'' | publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]] | date=December 8, 2006 | accessdate=April 18, 2024}}</ref> The project charted two singles: "The Reason Why" (featuring [[Alison Krauss]]) and "What You Give Away" (featuring Sheryl Crow).{{Sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} At the end of 2006, ''These Days'' was certified platinum.<ref name="riaa"/> "The Reason Why" won Gill a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2007; one year later, ''These Days'' won Best Country Album and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].<ref name="grammy"/>

Following the death of [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] member [[Glenn Frey]] in 2017, Gill was asked by the remaining band members to replace him.

==Musical style==
Gill's music is defined by his [[tenor]] voice, guitar playing, and breadth of influences. The editors of ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music'' wrote of Gill, "With an aching tenor, award-winning songwriting skills, and virtuoso guitar chops that rivals those of any ace Nashville session player, Vince Gill is one of today's biggest country superstars."<ref name="encyclopedia"/> His vocal style has also been noted for its [[bluegrass music]] phrasing.<ref name="favorite"/> Steve Huey of AllMusic describes Gill as "one of the most respected musicians in the history of country music".<ref name="allmusic"/> He characterizes Gill's early work as influential in the [[neotraditional country]] movements of the late 1980s to early 1990s, but thought his membership in both Pure Prairie League and the Eagles showed an interest in his music outside of country music as well.<ref name="allmusic"/> Sarah Rodman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' referred to Gill as "the Oklahoma native with the tenor kissed by angels and the guitar prowess of a man who made a deal with the devil" and stated that he "rose to become one of the most respected names in country music, often serving as a link between the classic artists that preceded him and the generation of stars that have followed in his footsteps."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/music/2019/08/29/vince-gill-okie-country-eagles-interview/ | title=Vince Gill on Okie, the new class of country artists, and playing with the Eagles | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=August 29, 2019 | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Sarah Rodman}}</ref> Jeffrey B. Remz, writing for Country Standard Time, stated that Gill "was a fine singer with his sturdy tenor, and his guitar playing has always been considered top notch. A heavy touring schedule resulted from his success with concerts sometimes going on for three hours. He was not a paint-by-the-numbers kind of country performer."<ref name="cst remz"/> Joe Bosso of ''[[Guitar World]]'' describes Gill as having "virtuosic and sweetly expressive solos" in both [[flatpicking]] and [[fingerstyle guitar]]; in the same article, Gill himself stated that he "play[s] what's necessary".<ref name="guitar world">{{cite web | url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/vince-gill-im-content-to-say-what-i-want-on-the-guitar-and-i-can-leave-it-at-that | title=Vince Gill: "I reached the point where I said, ‘I’m just going to play what’s necessary’" | publisher=Guitar World | date=December 23, 2019 | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Joe Bosso}}</ref> Of his guitar playing, Jo Sgammato stated that his playing lead guitar while also being a vocalist was uncommon among country music artists; she also noted that critics had compared his style to [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Chet Atkins]].{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=2}}

Gill cites [[Merle Haggard]] as one of his main influences. In 2003, he stated in an interview with Country Standard Time, "he's the greatest singer, the greatest phraser, and then on top of that, his songs are really poetic."<ref name="cst remz"/> He has also named female artists he grew up on, such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Kitty Wells]], as influences.<ref name="monroe boot">{{cite web | url=https://theboot.com/vince-gill-inspired-by-female-artists/ | title=Vince Gill: 'I've been inspired as much or more by women artists' | publisher=The Boot | date=June 9, 2015 | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Christina Vinson}}</ref> Outside of country, Gill has also named [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[John Fogerty]] as influences, as he considered their works to have "honesty".{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=68}} Gill said that he characterized his own songwriting by "simplicity", a characteristic he also thought was present in the works of [[Hank Williams]].<ref name="gene">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/902042794 | title=Vince Gill may be the nicest guy in Nashville | publisher=The Monitor | date=January 24, 1996 | accessdate=April 18, 2024 | author=Gene Harbrecht}}</ref> Jo Sgammato also noted in ''The Vince Gill Story'' that Gill's albums had a higher number of songs written by him than his contemporaries did.{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=121}} She also thought the track "Nothing Like a Woman" from ''I Still Believe in You'' had a [[Motown]] influence due to Gill's "high, wailing chorus", while comparing both "Say Hello" from the same album  and "Don't Come Cryin' to Me" from ''The Key'' to the [[Bakersfield sound]].{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=122-123, 196}} Additionally, Sgammato observed that Gill tended to have hits with ballads more frequently than with up-tempo material, although she cited "Liza Jane" and "One More Last Chance" as successful examples of the latter.{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=126}}

Gill has also been named as an influence by other artists. [[Jason Sellers]] played bass guitar in Gill's road band in the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jason-sellers-mn0000224646 | title=Jason Sellers biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 20, 2024 | author=Heather Phares}}</ref> and consulted Gill a number of times for career advice prior to singing with [[BNA Records]] in 1997. In a review of his debut album, Jeff Davis of Country Standard Time thought that Sellers idolized Gill and was "imitative" of him.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1334 | title=''I'm Your Man'' review | publisher=Country Standard Time | accessdate=April 20, 2024 | author=Jeff Davis}}</ref> In turn, Sellers filled in for Gill on a number of live performances of "Don't Rush" where Gill was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1702906/brad-paisley-jams-with-reo-speedwagon-at-sony-musics-crs-party.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305134806/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1702906/brad-paisley-jams-with-reo-speedwagon-at-sony-musics-crs-party.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 5, 2013 |title=Brad Paisley Jams With REO Speedwagon at Sony Music's CRS Party |first=Calvin|last=Gilbert |work=CMT |date=March 1, 2013 |access-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/1550479/country-radio-seminar-miranda-lambert-brad-paisley|title=Country Radio Seminar: Miranda Lambert, Brad Paisley, Pistol Annies and REO Speedwagon Rock the Boat |author= Deborah Evans-Price|magazine=Billboard|date=March 1, 2013|access-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wincountry.com/news/articles/2013/apr/08/the-48th-annual-acm-awards-the-performances/|title=The 48th Annual ACM Awards: The Performances|date=April 8, 2013|work=WNWN FM|access-date=April 19, 2013|archive-date=April 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426202013/http://wincountry.com/news/articles/2013/apr/08/the-48th-annual-acm-awards-the-performances/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Country and bluegrass singer [[Charlie Worsham]] has named Gill as an influence, and claimed that "Liza Jane" was one of the first songs he learned to play on guitar. In 2018, Gill gave Worsham a custom-made guitar, which Worsham played on his second album ''[[Beginning of Things]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://holler.country/news/breaking/vince-gill-gifted-charlie-worsham-a-guitar-as-a-wedding-present/ | title=Vince Gill gifted Charlie Worsham a guitar as a wedding present | publisher=Holler.Country | date=May 28, 2021 | accessdate=April 20, 2024}}</ref>
