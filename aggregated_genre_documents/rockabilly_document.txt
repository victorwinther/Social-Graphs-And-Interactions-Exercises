==Biography==
===Early career===
He was born in [[Lenapah, Oklahoma]], United States.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Downing began his career doing piano and vocals in [[Bobby Poe]] and The Poe Kats,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> who were an early backing band for country entertainer [[Wanda Jackson]]. His piano contributed to the single "Let's Have A Party", which was released in 1960. The song reached No. 32 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made the Top 40 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]].

Downing reached the U.S. Hot 100 with "You’ll Never Miss the Water (Till the Well Runs Dry)", a duet with [[Little Esther Phillips]]. After the release of this single, he was signed by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1974, Downing recorded the single, "[[I'll Be Holding On]]", which went to number one on the U.S. [[Disco]] chart for three weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974–2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=83}}</ref> In addition, "I'll Be Holding On" was a hit in Europe.

===Country music with Warner Brothers===
Al Downing's popularity continued to grow, and he had several hits on the country charts between 1978 and 1989. He compiled a list of his own songs, which he presented to his producer at Warner Brothers. In 1978, "Mr. Jones" reached the Top 20, followed by "Touch Me (I'll Be Your Fool Once More)" in 1979. That same year, Downing produced "Midnight Lace," which reached the 50s on the charts, and "I Ain't No Fool," which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the "Story Behind The Story" reached the Top 40 and "Bring It On Home" reached the Top 20.

Two years passed before Downing created another hit, this time with the Team label. In 1982, "I'll Be Loving You" reached the Top 50, followed by "Darlene," which reached the lower 60s. The next year, "It Takes Love" reached the Top 40, followed by "Let's Sing About Love," which peaked in the mid-60s. In 1984, "The Best Of Families" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, "There’ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong".

===Vine Street years===
In 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the "Oh How Beautiful You Are" (To Me) and "Just One Night Won't Do," both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, "I Guess By Now."

The popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: "Mary, Oh Mary" and "Heartbreak Hill". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby "Blue" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.

===Later career===
Downing built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including "Mr. Jones."

In July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.

In 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.

Downing continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at [[Ontario]]'s [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Roy Clark]]. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.

==Style==
Downing's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.

== Producer ==
In additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent. In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represented his last recording.

'''Asleep at the Wheel''' is an American [[country music|Western Swing music]] group that was formed in [[Paw Paw, West Virginia]],<ref name="Official Web Site">{{cite web|url=http://www.asleepatthewheel.com/set_story.html |title=Asleep at the Wheel Official Site |website=Asleepatthewheel.com |access-date=November 28, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010070656/http://www.asleepatthewheel.com/set_story.html |archive-date=October 10, 2007 }}</ref> and is based in [[Austin, Texas]]. The band has won nine Grammy Awards since their 1970 inception, released over twenty albums, and has charted more than 21 singles on the ''Billboard'' country charts. Their highest-charting single, "[[The Letter That Johnny Walker Read]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;10 in 1975.

==History==
===Beginnings to Austin===
In 1969, [[Ray Benson]] and [[Lucky Oceans]] (Reuben Gosfield) co-founded Asleep at the Wheel in Paw Paw, West Virginia, and soon after they found themselves opening for [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Hot Tuna]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="Official Web Site"/> A year later, they moved to [[East Oakland, California]], at the invitation of [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]].<ref name="allmusicguide">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1509|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic – Asleep at the Wheel|access-date=December 12, 2007|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> After being mentioned in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine by [[Van Morrison]], they landed a record deal with [[United Artists]].<ref name="allmusicguide"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/articles/story/5939314/van_morrison|author=Grissim Jr., John|title=Van Morrison: The Rolling Stone interview|date=June 22, 1972|publisher=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211150105/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanmorrison/articles/story/5939314/van_morrison|archive-date=December 11, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1973, their debut album, ''[[Comin' Right at Ya]]'', was released by United Artists. At the invitation of [[Willie Nelson]], they left Oakland for Austin in 1974.<ref name="Official Web Site"/>

===1974–1979===
In 1974, Asleep at the Wheel released its [[Asleep at the Wheel (album)|self-titled second album]], with a cover of [[Louis Jordan]]'s "[[Choo Choo Ch'Boogie]]", which was the band's first single to hit the country charts. The following year had the release of ''[[Texas Gold]]'', with the top-ten Country hit single "The Letter That Johnny Walker Read". In addition, they played on [[PBS]]'s ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', where they have since performed a record-setting 10 times.<ref name="Official Web Site"/> In 1977, the band was voted Best Country Western Band by ''Rolling Stone'' and was awarded the Touring Band of the Year by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. They also went on tour with [[Emmylou Harris]] in Europe.<ref name="Official Web Site"/> The following year, they recorded a cover of [[Count Basie]]'s song "[[One O'Clock Jump]]".<ref name="allmusicguide"/> Also in 1980, they appeared in the movie ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', along with [[Meat Loaf]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and [[Art Carney]]. By the end of the decade, the band recorded their first live album, ''Served Live'', at the [[Austin Opera House]].<ref name="Official Web Site"/>

===1980–1989===
The 1980s became a turbulent decade for the band. After moving to [[MCA Records|MCA]], co-founder Lucky Oceans left, followed in September 1986 by Chris O'Connell due to her pregnancy. Asleep at the Wheel gathered a large amount of debt that required it to work on [[Television advertisement|commercials]] and [[movie soundtrack]]s.  This band produced the soundtrack for the film ''[[Liar's Moon]]''.

In 1985, the band released a virtually ignored self-titled album.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> By the late 1980s, Ray Benson had done some producing, allowing the band a second chance with [[Epic Records]]. In 1987, the band released ''10'', which won them their second Grammy for Best Country Instrumental, helping to launch their comeback. The album also had contributions from legendary fiddle player and onetime [[Texas Playboys]] member [[Johnny Gimble]].<ref name="allmusicguide"/> The following year, the band released ''Western Standard Time'', which won them another Grammy for Best Country Instrumental.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> The late 1980s also had the growth of [[Jann Browne]] as a solo vocalist in the group; she would later embark on a solo career on [[Curb Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1538|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jann Browne biography |access-date=January 7, 2008 |last=Deming |first=Mark |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

===1990–1999===
The band moved to [[Arista Records]] and released the album, ''Keepin' Me Up Nights''. Soon after, the band had turnover. Among its new members was former solo singer [[Rosie Flores]], who joined in 1997.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2213&dat=19970412&id=JagkAAAAIBAJ&pg=2228,1441285 |title=Country singer Rosie Flores joins Asleep at the Wheel |newspaper=Calhoun Times and Gordon County News |date=April 12, 1997 |first=Mario |last=Tarradell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419005441/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2213&dat=19970412&id=JagkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bjoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2228,1441285 |archive-date=April 19, 2016 |url-status=live |page=17}}</ref> In 1991, Ray Benson directed the music<ref name="Official Web Site"/> and co-starred in the movie ''[[Wild Texas Wind]]'' with [[Dolly Parton]].<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103263/|title=Wild Texas Wind|website=IMDb.com|access-date=December 12, 2007}}</ref> In honor of the 66th anniversary of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]], the band launched the ''Route 66 Tour''.<ref name="Official Web Site"/> In 1993, the band released an instant hit with several guest musicians,<ref name="Official Web Site"/> ''A Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys'', to much critical acclaim.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> Two years later, the band celebrated their 25th anniversary<ref name="Official Web Site"/> by releasing ''The Wheel Keeps on Rollin''.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> In 1999, the band and [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] released ''Ride with Bob'', as their second tribute album to [[Bob Wills]]. This album also enjoyed immediate success and garnered the band two Grammy wins, one for Best Country Instrumental,<ref name="Official Web Site"/> and the other for Best Package Design.

According to ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Ray Benson "didn't just enlist the obvious Wills fans" in this tribute album to Bob Wills like [[Merle Haggard]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Lyle Lovett]]. He also brought in some of country's young lions the [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Lee Ann Womack]], some [[pop (music)|pop]] stars", including [[Shawn Colvin]], the [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]], and fellow country preservationists such as [[Dwight Yoakam]].<ref name="Dansby">[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/asleepatthewheel/articles/story/5924982/asleep_at_the_wheel_proves_bob_wills_is_still_the_king] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210200733/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/asleepatthewheel/articles/story/5924982/asleep_at_the_wheel_proves_bob_wills_is_still_the_king|date=December 10, 2007}}</ref>

'''BR549''' (originally spelled '''BR5-49''') was an American [[country rock]] band founded in 1993.<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=61}}</ref> It originally consisted of Gary Bennett (lead and background vocals, acoustic guitar), Don Herron (steel guitar, [[resonator guitar]], fiddle, mandolin, acoustic guitar), "Smilin'" Jay McDowell (upright bass), [[Chuck Mead]] (lead and background vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar), and "Hawk" Shaw Wilson (drums, background vocals).<ref name="Larkin90"/> Bennett and McDowell left the band in 2001, with [[Chris Scruggs]] and Geoff Firebaugh respectively replacing them. Both Firebaugh and Scruggs later left the band as well; Mark Miller has become the band's third bassist. The name of the band is taken from a mangled phone number from ''[[Hee Haw]]'' comedian [[Junior Samples]]' car salesman skit.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygsEAAAAMBAJ&q=BR-549|title=Dial BR5-49 For Alternate Country|magazine=Billboard|last=Bessman |first=Jim|date=15 July 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en|page=1}}</ref>

BR549 released six albums and two EPs, including three albums on [[Arista Nashville]] and two on [[Dualtone Records]]. The band's self-titled [[BR5-49 (album)|debut album]] produced three singles on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1996. The band was nominated three times for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], in 1996 ("Cherokee Boogie"), 1997 ("Wild One") and 1999 ("Honky Tonk Song").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/br5-49/8344 |title=BR5-49 |publisher=[[Grammy Awards]]}}</ref> As well as a nomination for the Top New Vocal Duo or Group award from the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] in 1997.<ref name="Past winners and nominees">{{Cite news |url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners |title=Winners database |work=ACM Country |access-date=December 29, 2022}}</ref>

==History==
{{Expand section|More info on each album, critical reception, sound|date=January 2009}}
Before moving to Nashville and forming BR5-49, Chuck Mead played in a band called Homestead Grays, a roots-rock outfit based in his hometown of [[Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref name="Larkin90"/> Gary Bennett, meanwhile fronted an informal band that played at [[Robert's Western World|Robert's Western Wear]], a clothing store in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], when he met Mead at a nearby bar.<ref name=Huey/> The two then decided to form a band officially, and completing the lineup were electric bassist Jim "Bones" Becker, then [[upright bass]]ist "Smilin'" Jay McDowell (formerly of another band called Hellbilly), multi-instrumentalist Don Herron, and drummer "Hawk" Shaw Wilson. They assumed the name BR5-49 (from the telephone number of a used car dealer in a running [[Junior Samples]] comedy sketch on the television series ''[[Hee Haw]]''),<ref name=Huey/> and began playing for tips at Robert's.

===1995–2000: Arista Nashville===
They were signed by [[Arista Nashville]] in September 1995.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ag4EAAAAMBAJ&q=BR-549&pg=PA30|title=Twain Dominates Canadian Awards; BR-549 Signed To Arista, Finally|magazine=Billboard|last=Flippo |first=Chet|date=30 September 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en|page=30}}</ref> The band's first release for the label was an [[extended play]] entitled ''Live at Robert's'', which comprised originals and cover songs.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Following it in 1996 was their full-length debut album, also titled ''[[BR5-49 (album)|BR5-49]]''.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Despite minimal support from country radio,<ref name=Huey/> the album's lead-off single "Cherokee Boogie" (a cover of a [[Moon Mullican]] song) reached No.&nbsp;44 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts in the US, and No.&nbsp;21 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts in Canada. Following this song were "Even If It's Wrong" and "Little Ramona (Gone Hillbilly Nuts)",<ref name="Larkin90"/> which respectively reached No.&nbsp;68 and No.&nbsp;61 in the US. The album itself was a No.&nbsp;33 on the [[Top Country Albums]] chart. The band also toured with [[The Mavericks]], [[Junior Brown]], and [[The Black Crowes]] and played on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' in 1997.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/artists/program78.html Mary Chapin Carpenter followed by BR5-49], Austin City Limits, 1997</ref>   According to the All Music Guide to Country, BR5-49's recording of "Honky Tonk Song" on the BR5-49 album should be considered an essential country song, although it does not consider either the album itself, or the group essential.<ref>Vladimir Bogdanov, et al, editors ''All Music Guide to Country'', 2nd Edition, Ann Arbor: AMG, 2003</ref>

BR5-49's second album, ''[[Big Backyard Beat Show]]'', was released in 1998.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Despite not producing a chart single, this album reached No.&nbsp;38 on the Top Country Albums chart. After touring with [[Brian Setzer]], the band issued a live album, ''Coast to Coast'', in 1999 on Arista as well. The band left Arista in 2000 after the label was merged with [[Sony BMG]].

===2001–present===
After being dropped from Arista, they signed to Lucky Dog Records, a subsidiary of [[Epic Records]]. Their first release for the label, 2001's ''This Is BR549'', also eliminated the [[hyphen]] from the band's name.<ref name=Huey/> Its only single, "Too Lazy to Work, Too Nervous to Steal", peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on Country Singles Sales but did not enter the country singles charts proper. After this album, both Bennett and McDowell left the band, with Geoff Firebaugh succeeding McDowell as upright bassist, and [[Chris Scruggs]] taking over on guitar and vocals. The new lineup made its first appearance in 2003 on their self released album ''Temporarily Disconnected''. In 2004, they signed with [[Dualtone Records]] and released ''Tangled in the Pines''. Scruggs left the band to tour solo in 2005. Firebaugh also left to start his own band, Hillbilly Casino. Mark Miller replaced Firebaugh. A second album for Dualtone, ''Dog Days'', was released in early 2006.

Since 2013 the band has been on hiatus, with Chuck Mead working solo with Mark Miller playing bass, and Don Herron touring with [[Bob Dylan]].  On July 12, 2012, Jay McDowell announced on his personal Facebook page that the original line-up of BR5-49 would open for [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] at Woods Amphitheater in Nashville, TN on July 28. On July 27, 2012, the (reunited) original lineup recorded an original Gary Bennett song called "A Truck Stop Christmas" at the East Nashville Studio of Phil Harris, which was released on the 2012 Christmas compilation ''An East Nashville Christmas''.  On May 9, 2013, it was announced that the original lineup would play together live once again, this time at the Havelock Country Jamboree in Canada on August 17, 2013.

==Status of former members==
Original co-frontman Gary Bennett released his solo debut, ''Human Condition'', in February 2006. In October 2010 [[Raucous Records]] released Bennett's follow up album ''My Ol' Guitar'' co-produced by [[Kenny Vaughan]] and including several BR549 re-recordings.

Smilin' Jay McDowell has gone on to work in post production in the music video world. He is now in charge of the video department for the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Nashville. He directed a DVD project for Gary Bennett titled ''Inside and Out''.

Former bassist Geoff Firebaugh founded a [[rockabilly]] band named Hillbilly Casino that are a crowd favorite in downtown Nashville on lower Broadway.

Chris Scruggs released a solo album titled ''Anthem'' in 2009. As of 2015, he is the bassist and multi-instrumentalist in [[Marty Stuart]]’s backing band, The Fabulous Superlatives.

Chuck Mead released ''Journeyman's Wager'' in 2009 and toured with his Grassy Knoll Boys in support of the release; this was followed by the classic-country covers album ''Back at the Quonset Hut'' in 2012 and ''Free State Serenade'' in 2014.  In 2006 Chuck began his association with the hit Broadway Musical ''[[Million Dollar Quartet (musical)|Million Dollar Quartet]]'' beginning in Florida as the Musical Arranger and Musical Director; he has also worked with the cast at The [[Village Theatre]] near Seattle, Washington, The [[Goodman Theatre]] in Chicago and The [[Nederlander Theatre]] on Broadway in New York City.  He is currently{{when|date=June 2017}} working with the new cast in England as they prepare to open at The [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in  [[City of Westminster]].

Mark Miller was a founding member of The Ex-Husbands, formed in New York City in 1993 with lead singer Anders Thomsen and drummer Michael Smith. The band released two critically acclaimed albums on Tar Hut Records – a self-titled debut and the follow-up, ''All Gussied Up''.  Both made the Gavin Americana top 20 and the latter reached that chart's top 10. Miller released the solo record ''Dodsen Chapel'' in 2005.

Original bass picker Jim "Bones" Becker is now retired and says, "I'm not doing anything now, and I'm getting damn good at it!"

==Musical style and influences==
{{Expand section|date=July 2023}}
According to ''[[Trouser Press]]'', while [[alternative country]] bands typically try to emulate the sound of pre-[[rock and roll]] era country music, BR549's sound draws from post-rock and roll styles, "when honky tonk, [[rockabilly]], [[Western swing]], bittersweet storyteller swill and [[Sheb Wooley]] all commingled in search of proper homes in the evolving [[country music|country]] landscape."<ref name=TrouserPress>{{cite web |url=https://trouserpress.com/reviews/br549/ |title=BR549 |last= |first= |publisher=Trouser Press |access-date=2022-11-09}}</ref> BR549's sound  encompasses alternative country,<ref name=Huey>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/br5-49-mn0000071958/biography |title=BR5-49 Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=2022-11-09}}</ref><ref name=TrouserPress/> Western swing,<ref name=Huey/> [[Bakersfield sound]],<ref name=Huey/> rockabilly<ref name=Huey/><ref name=TrouserPress/> and [[country rock]].<ref name=Huey/><ref name=TrouserPress/> According to ''Trouser Press'', the band "poised themselves as authentic defenders of the faith, but a name taken from a recurring ''Hee Haw'' skit and a predilection for campy vintage clothing threatened to make them alt-country’s answer to [[Sha Na Na]]."<ref name=TrouserPress/> Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] described their sound and appearance as "unabashedly retro", as the band's members dressed in "old, budget-friendly clothes".<ref name=Huey/>

'''Bill Haley & His Comets''' was an American [[rock and roll]] band formed in 1947 and continuing until Haley's death in 1981. The band was also known as '''Bill Haley and the Comets''' and '''Bill Haley's Comets'''. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group recorded nine Top 20 singles, one of which was number one and three that were Top Ten. The single "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" was the best-selling rock single in the history of the genre and maintained that position for several years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Vladimir|last2=Woodstra|first2=Chris|last3=Erlewine|first3=Stephen Tomas|date=2003|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music|location=|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=315|isbn=0-87930-760-9}}</ref>

Band leader [[Bill Haley]] had previously been a [[Western swing]] performer; after recording a [[rockabilly]] version of [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]'s "[[Rocket 88]]", one of the first rock and roll recordings, Haley changed his band's musical direction to rock music. They went on to record hit versions of "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]", "[[Shake, Rattle & Roll]]", the aforementioned "Rock Around the Clock", "Dim, Dim the Lights", "[[Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie]]", "Razzle-Dazzle", "[[See You Later, Alligator]]", "[[When the Saints Go Marching In|The Saints Rock 'N' Roll]]" and "[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]". In 1956, the group appeared in two early rock and roll movies with disc jockey [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]''.

Though the group was considered to be at the forefront of rock and roll during the genre's formative years, the arrival of more risqué acts such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]] by 1956 led the more clean-cut Haley and his Comets to decline in popularity. Haley would remain popular in [[Europe]] and go on to have a comeback as a nostalgia act in the 1970s, along with many of his contemporaries. Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally.

==Early history==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Comets Ed Sullivan 1955.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley and the Comets on the Ed Sullivan Show or Toast of the Town, Sunday, August 7, 1955, CBS, Hartford, Connecticut]] -->
In around the mid-1940s, Bill Haley performed with the Down Homers and formed a group called the Four Aces of Western Swing. The group that later became the Comets initially formed as "Bill Haley and the Saddlemen" {{Circa|1949}}–1952, and performed mostly country and western songs, though occasionally with a bluesy feel. The group was also the first to record a cover version (in July 1951) of [[Rocket 88]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edsullivan.com/artists/bill-haley-his-comets/|title=Artists, Bill Haley & His Comets|date=June 14, 2015|work=Ed Sullivan|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> originally a [[jump blues]] song by [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats, who were actually [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]. He did so for the [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Holiday Records]] label, in what is now recognized as a [[rockabilly]] style. It sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s [[rhythm and blues]] song called "[[Rock the Joint]]" for Holiday's sister company, [[Essex Records]].

During those years however, Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America. Many Saddlemen recordings were not released until the 1970s and 1980s, and highlights included romantic ballads such as "Rose of My Heart" and [[western swing]] tunes such as "Yodel Your Blues Away." The original members of this group were Haley, pianist and accordion player [[Johnny Grande]] and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Billy Williamson (guitarist)|Billy Williamson]]. Al Thompson was the group's first bass player, followed by [[Al Rex]] and [[Marshall Lytle]]. During the group's early years, it recorded under several other names, including Johnny Clifton and His String Band and [[Reno Browne]] and Her Buckaroos (although Browne, a female matinee idol of the time, did not actually appear on the record).

"Rocket 88", "Rock the Joint", and their immediate follow-ups were released under the increasingly incongruous Saddlemen name. It soon became apparent that a new name for the group was needed to fit the new musical style. A friend of Haley's, making note of the common mispronunciation of the name [[Halley's Comet]] to rhyme with ''Bailey'', suggested that Haley call his band the Comets. This event is cited in the Haley biographies ''Sound and Glory'' by John Haley and John von Hoelle; ''Bill Haley'' by John Swenson; and in ''Still Rockin' Around the Clock'', a memoir by Comets bass player Marshall Lytle.

The new name for the group was adopted in the fall of 1952, before the 1953 release of "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]" which had some elements of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2135591-Bill-Haley-With-Haleys-Comets-Crazy-Man-Crazy|title=Bill Haley With Haley's Comets* – Crazy Man, Crazy|date=July 6, 2017|work=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> Members of the group at that time were Haley, Johnny Grande, Billy Williamson and Marshall Lytle. Grande usually played piano on records but switched to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and easier to deal with during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around. Soon after renaming the band Haley hired his first drummer, Earl Famous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/jodimars1.html|title=RAB Hall of Fame: The Jodimars|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215123/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Jodimars1.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Displeased with the lineup, Haley sought out Dick Boccelli (also known as Dick Richards), who turned down the job but recommended a young drummer Charlie Higler. Soon after, Haley asked Richards again, who then accepted the role. During this time (and as late as the fall of 1955), Haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player, choosing to use session musicians on records and either playing lead guitar himself or having Williamson play steel solos.

Even before the release of more successful records, the group had achieved greatness in some respects: "No one had blended country and R&B on a single before the Comets' "Rock the Joint". No one had scored an American Top 20 hit with anything that could really qualify as rock'n'roll before their single "Crazy Man Crazy" in 1953".<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/22/bill-haley-rock-around-the-clock-worlds-first-rock-anthem|title=Bill Haley: Rock Around the Clock – the world's first rock anthem|date=May 22, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

==National success and "Rock Around the Clock"==
[[File:BillHaleyHankSnowTicket.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley/Elvis/Hank Snow Ticket – Oklahoma City newspaper ad. for Sunday October 16, 1955; two shows at the Municipal Auditorium. Note: Elvis Presley's first appearance to be co-promoted (with Hank Snow) by Colonel Tom Parker.]]
In 1953, Haley scored his first national success with his original song, "Crazy Man, Crazy", a phrase Haley said he heard from his teenage audience, again released on Essex. Haley later claimed the recording sold a million copies, but this is considered an exaggeration. Some sources indicate that the recording—a blend of R&B, western and pop music—is a contender for the title of "first rock'n'roll record" while others state that it was merely "the first rock and roll song to be a hit on the pop charts". It was also said to be the first rock'n'roll recording to be played on national television in the United States (in an episode of [[Omnibus (American TV program)]] in 1953).<ref>{{cite book |last=Kallen |first=Stuart |date=May 9, 2012 |title=The History of American Pop |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zohmDwAAQBAJ&q=Crazy+Man%2C+Crazy+bill+haley+million&pg=PA33 |publisher=Greenhaven Publishing LLC |pages=33–34 |isbn=978-1420506723}}</ref>

On their last release from Essex, new band member Joey Ambrose is heard on the B-side, "Straight Jacket."

In the spring of 1954, Haley and His Comets left Essex for New York-based [[Decca Records]], where they were placed under the auspices of veteran producer [[Milt Gabler]], who would produce all of the band's recordings for the label and who had been involved in creating many proto-rock and roll recordings by the likes of the [[The Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]] and [[Louis Jordan]] dating back to the 1940s. One of Jordan's records, [[Saturday Night Fish Fry]] (1949), is considered to be a contender for the title of "first rock'n' roll record. Gabler later commented that "all the tricks I used with Louis Jordan, I used with Bill Haley".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30288/5-candidates-first-rock-n-roll-song |title=5 Candidates for the First Rock 'n' Roll Song |date=March 23, 2012 |publisher=Mentalfloss |access-date=August 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://wwwrock'n'roll.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/16/popandrock#:~:text=The%20most%20widely%20held%20belief,records%20and%20discover%20Elvis%20Presley] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>

The group's first session, on April 12, 1954, yielded "[[Rock Around the Clock]]", which would become Haley's biggest hit and one of the most important records in rock and roll history. Sales of "Rock Around the Clock" started slowly, since it was the B-side of the single, but it performed well enough, that a second Decca session was commissioned.

"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]" followed, a somewhat bowdlerized cover version of the [[Big Joe Turner]] recording<ref name=pc4>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19750/m1/ |title=Show 4 – The Tribal Drum: The Rise of Rhythm and Blues. [Part 2] }}</ref> released earlier in 1954. The single was one of Decca's best-selling records of 1954<ref>''Billboard'', January 15, 1955, p. 38.</ref> and the seventh-best-selling record in November 1954.<ref>''Billboard'', November 13, 1954, p. 64.</ref>

In 1954, [[Anita Gordon]] starred in ''Round Up of Rhythm'', a film short in which she, and Disc Jockey Bill Delzell, played ' Straight Jacket ' and 'Shake Rattle and Roll', which the group are seen playing.

In March 1955, the group had four songs in Cash Box magazine's top 50 songs: "Dim, Dim the Lights (I Want Some Atmosphere)"; "Birth of the Boogie"; "Mambo Rock"; and "Shake, Rattle and Roll."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550305.html|title=Cash Box Top Singles 3/05/55|publisher=Cashboxmagazine.com|date=March 5, 1955|access-date=November 4, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422080253/http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550305.html|archive-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref>

Haley's "Shake, Rattle and Roll" never achieved the same level of historical importance as "Rock Around the Clock" but it predated it as the first international rock and roll hit. It did not attain the Number 1 position on the American charts, but it became Haley's first gold record. [[Elvis Presley]] recorded the song in 1956, combining Haley's arrangement with Turner's original lyrics, but his version was not a substantial hit. Late in 1954, Haley recorded another hit, "Dim, Dim The Lights", which was one of the first R&B songs recorded by a white group to cross over to the R&B charts. [[Johnnie Ray]] had reached Number 1 with "[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]" in 1952.

The belated success of "Rock Around the Clock" is attributed to its use in the soundtrack of the film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]],''<ref name=pc5>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19751/m1/ |title=Show 5 – Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The Rock Revolution Gets Underway. [Part 1] }}</ref> which was released on March 19, 1955. The song was re-released to coincide with the film and shifted to the single's A-side. Haley's recording became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/bill-haley|title=Bill Haley|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=October 10, 2016}}</ref> and reached Number 1 on the pop charts, remaining there for eight weeks,<ref name="auto1">[https://www.billboard.com/articles//6634450/rewinding-the-charts-60-years-ago-bill-haley-ushered-in-the-rock-era] {{Dead link|date=May 2021|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> and went to Number 3 on the R&B chart.<ref>

Ambrose's acrobatic saxophone playing, along with Lytle on the double bass – literally on it, riding it like a pony, and holding it over his head – were highlights of the band's live performances during this time. Their music and their act were part of a tradition in [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]], but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience. In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a [[short subject]] entitled ''Round Up of Rhythm'', performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217775/|title=Round Up of Rhythm (1954) - IMDb|access-date=November 24, 2020|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

[[Image:BillHaley.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954. Left to right: Joey D'Ambrosio, Dick Richards, Bill Haley]]
In 1955, Lytle, Richards and Ambrose quit the Comets in a salary dispute and formed their own group, the [[The Jodimars|Jodimars]]. Haley hired several new musicians to take their place: [[Rudy Pompilli]] on sax, Al Rex (a former member of the Saddlemen) on double bass, and Ralph Jones on drums. In addition, lead guitarist [[Franny Beecher]], who had been a session musician for Haley since [[Danny Cedrone]]'s death in the spring of 1954, became a full-time Comet and Haley's first performing lead guitarist (Cedrone had played the guitar solo on the original recording of "Rock Around the Clock" and died shortly after the recording session for "Shake, Rattle and Roll" in the summer of 1954). This version of the band became more popular than the earlier manifestation and appeared in several [[motion pictures]] over the next few years.

Other hits recorded by the band included "[[See You Later, Alligator]]"<ref name=pc5/> in which Haley's frantic delivery contrasted with the [[Louisiana]] languor of the original by [[Bobby Charles]], "Don't Knock the Rock", "Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie", "Rudy's Rock" (the first instrumental hit of the rock and roll era), and "Skinny Minnie."

Bill Haley and the Comets performed "Rock Around the Clock" in an a cappella and a lip-synched version on the [[NBC]] television program ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' hosted by [[Milton Berle]] on May 31, 1955. Berle predicted that the song would go to Number 1, calling the band "A group of entertainers who are going right to the top." Berle also sang and danced to the song, which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre a much wider audience.

Bill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll performers to appear on the [[CBS]] television musical variety program ''The [[Ed Sullivan Show]], or Toast of the Town'' on Sunday, August 7, 1955, in a broadcast from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. They performed a live version of "Rock Around the Clock" featuring Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The group made a second and final appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'' on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing "[[Rudy's Rock]]" and "Forty Cups of Coffee."

Bill Haley and the Comets appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television twice in 1957, on the prime-time show on October 28 and on the regular daytime show on November 27. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' (also known as ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]''), a prime-time TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season (performing "Rock Around the Clock" and "Ooh, Look-a There, Ain't She Pretty") and on February 20, 1960 (performing "Rock Around the Clock" and "Tamiami").

In 1956, the group appeared in two of the earliest full-length rock and roll movies with [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]].'' The [[The Platters|Platters]] were co-stars in the first movie, and [[Little Richard]] appeared in the second. ''Rock Around the Clock'' was produced by Sam Katzman (who would produce several Elvis Presley films in the 1960s) and directed by Fred F. Sears.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=1403164%7C184955&name=Rock-Around-the-Clock|title=&#124;Rock Around the Clock |website=Tcm.com|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

==Decline in popularity==
The band's popularity in the United States began to wane in 1956–57 as sexier, wilder acts such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]] began to dominate the record charts (although Haley's cover version of Little Richard's "[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]", released in direct competition with Little Richard's original recording, outsold the original). After "Skinny Minnie" hit the charts in 1958, Haley had little further success in the United States, although a spin-off group made up of Comets musicians dubbed '''The Kingsmen''' (no relation to the later group of "[[Louie, Louie]]" fame) had a hit with an instrumental, "Weekend", that same year.

Overseas, however, Haley and his band continued to be popular, touring the United Kingdom in February 1957, when Haley and his crew were mobbed by thousands of fans at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] in London at an incident which the media dubbed the "Second [[Battle of Waterloo]]". The group also toured Australia in 1957, and in 1958 enjoyed a successful (if riot-dominated) tour of the European mainland. Bill Haley & His Comets were the first major American rock and roll act to tour the world in this way. Elvis, who was [[Elvis Presley's Army career|on military duty]] in Germany, visited them backstage at some shows. On a free day in Berlin they performed two songs in the [[Caterina Valente]] movie ''Hier Bin ich Hier Bleib Ich (Here I Am Here I Stay)''.

Back in the U.S., Haley attempted to start his own record label, Clymax, and establish his own stable of performers, notably [[Sally Starr (TV hostess)|Sally Starr]] (the hostess of a Philadelphia television children's program) and the [[Matys Brothers]]. Members of the Comets were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings, many of which were written or co-written by Haley and members of the Comets. The Clymax experiment only lasted about a year. In 1959, Haley's relationship with Decca collapsed; after a final set of instrumental-only recordings in the fall, Haley announced he was leaving Decca for the new [[Warner Bros. Records]] label, which released two more albums in 1960, which were moderately successful. In 1960 Franny Beecher and Rudi Pompilli left the Comets to start their own record label. Replacing Beecher was a 20-year-old guitarist, [[Johnny Kay]], from Chester, Pennsylvania. Beecher later returned briefly to play with the Comets, when his record label failed to take off, sharing guitar duties with Kay. Kay left the band in 1966 but returned in the early 1970s for an aborted world tour. He appeared in the Wembley show, which was filmed and released as the London Rock and Roll Show.

==Mexico and the late 1960s==
In 1961–1962, '''Bill Haley y sus Cometas''' (as the band was known in Hispanic America) signed with the [[Orfeón]] label of Mexico and scored an unexpected hit with "Twist Español", a Spanish-language recording based on the [[Twist (dance)|twist]] dance craze, which was sweeping America at the time. Haley followed up with "Florida Twist" (#3 MEX, according to Billboard Hits Of The World 04.21.62), which was for a time the biggest-selling single in Mexican history. Although [[Chubby Checker]] and [[Hank Ballard]] were credited with starting the twist craze in America, in Mexico and Latin America, Bill Haley and His Comets were proclaimed the Kings of the Twist. Thanks to the success of "Twist Español" and "Florida Twist", among others, the band had continued success in Mexico and Latin America over the next few years, selling many recordings of Spanish and Spanish-flavored material and simulated live performances ([[overdubbed]] audience over studio recordings) on the Orfeon label and its subsidiary, Dimsa. They hosted a television series, ''Orfeon a Go-Go'', and made [[cameo appearance]]s in several movies, lip-synching some of their old hits. Haley, who was fluent in Spanish, recorded a number of songs in the language, but most of the band's output during these years was instrumental recordings, many utilizing local session musicians playing trumpet. There was also some experimentation with Haley's style during this time; one single for Orfeon was a folk ballad, "Jimmy Martinez", which Haley recorded without the Comets.

In 1966, the Comets (without Bill Haley) cut an album for Orfeon as session musicians for Big Joe Turner, who had always been an idol to Haley; no joint performance of "Shake, Rattle and Roll" was recorded, however. In a 1974 interview with [[BBC Radio]], Haley said Turner's career was in a slump at this time, so he used his then-considerable influence with Orfeon to get Turner a recording session. The Comets' association with Orfeon/Dimsa ended later that year.

By 1967, as related by Haley in an interview with radio host [[Red Robinson]] in that year, the group was "a free agent" without any recording contracts at all, although the band continued to perform regularly in North America and Europe. During this year, Haley—without the Comets—recorded a pair of demos in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]: a country-western song, "[[Jealous Heart]]", on which he was backed by a local [[mariachi]] band (similar in style to the earlier "Jimmy Martinez"), and a late-60s-style rocker, "Rock on Baby", backed by a group called Superfine Dandelion. Neither recording would be released for 30 years. In 1968, Haley and the Comets recorded a single for the [[United Artists]] label, a version of [[Tom T. Hall]]'s "[[That's How I Got to Memphis]]", but no long-term association with the label resulted. In order to revive his recording career, Haley turned to Europe.

==Revival==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Little Richard Columbia 1956.jpg|left|thumb|Little Richard and Bill Haley on the set of the 1956 Columbia Pictures film ''Don't Knock the Rock''.]] -->
By the late 1960s, Haley and the Comets were considered an "oldies" act. The band's popularity never waned in Europe. The group signed a lucrative deal with [[Sonet Records]] of Sweden in 1968 and recorded in a new version of "Rock Around the Clock", which hit the European charts that year. The band recorded a mixture of live and studio albums for the label over the next decade.

In the United States in 1969, promoter Richard Nader launched a series of [[rock and roll revival]] concert tours featuring artists of the 1950s and 1960s. At one of the first of these shows, held at the [[Felt Forum]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, Haley received an eight-and-a-half-minute standing ovation following his performance, as Nader related in his recorded introduction to Haley's live album ''Bill Haley Scrapbook'', which was recorded a few weeks later at the [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]] club in New York.

The band appeared in several concert films in the early 1970s, including ''[[The London Rock and Roll Show]]'' (for which Haley's 1960–66 lead guitarist, John Kay, briefly rejoined the band) and ''[[Let the Good Times Roll (film)|Let the Good Times Roll]]''. After 1974, tax and management problems prevented Haley from performing in the United States, so he performed in Europe almost exclusively, though he also toured South America in 1975. The band was also kept busy in the studio, recording numerous albums for Sonet and other labels in the 1970s, several with a [[country music]] flavor. In 1974, Haley's original Decca recording of "Rock Around the Clock" hit the American sales charts once again, thanks to its use in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and for two years, on the television program ''[[Happy Days]]''.<ref name="auto1"/>

==Late career==
In February 1976, Haley's saxophone player and best friend, [[Rudy Pompilli]], died of [[cancer]] after a nearly 20-year career with the Comets. Haley continued to tour for the next year with a succession of new sax players, but his popularity was waning again, and his 1976 performance in London was critically lambasted in the music media, such as ''[[Melody Maker]]''. That year, the group also recorded an album, ''R-O-C-K'' at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] for Sonet Records. According to one source, "he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFzMvgEACAAJ|title=Crazy Man, Crazy The Bill Haley Story|author=Bill Haley, Jr., Peter Benjaminson |page= |date=October 3, 2019 |publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=9781617137112|accessdate=November 10, 2023}}</ref> Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]],<ref name=FallingComet>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/falling-comet/|title=Falling Comet|date=2011-06-01|website=Texas Monthly|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=bill+haley+%22alcoholism%22&pg=PP15|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=2003|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|language=en}}</ref> Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. 
In early 1977, Haley announced his retirement from performing and settled down at his home in Mexico. According to the John Swenson biography of Haley, the musician was quoted as saying that he and Pompilli had an agreement that if one died, the other would retire.

The Comets continued to tour on their own during this period.

In 1979, Haley was persuaded to return to performing with the offer of a lucrative contract to tour Europe. An almost completely new group of musicians, mostly British, including saxophonist [[Pete Thomas (saxophonist)|Pete Thomas]], were assembled to perform as the Comets. Haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie ''Blue Suede Shoes'', filmed at one of his London concerts in March 1979. A few days later, a performance in [[Birmingham]] was videotaped and aired on UK television; it was released on DVD in 2005. During the March tour, Haley recorded several tracks in London for his next album for Sonet, completing the work that summer in Muscle Shoals; the album, ''Everyone Can Rock & Roll'', issued later in 1979, was the last release of new recordings by Haley before his death.

On November 26, 1979, Haley and the Comets performed for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance/archive/detail/1979-london-theatre-royal|title=Performances :: 1979, London Theatre Royal &#124; Royal Variety Charity|website=Royalvarietycharity.org|access-date=May 12, 2023}}</ref> a moment Haley considered the proudest of his career. It was also the last time he performed in Europe and the last time most fans saw him perform "Rock Around the Clock".{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

Haley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Just before the South African tour commenced, Haley's health was reportedly failing, and he was reportedly diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]]; a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled.  The tour was critically lambasted, but surviving recordings of a performance in [[Johannesburg]] show Haley in good spirits and good voice. Nonetheless, according to the Haley News fan club newsletter and the Haley biography ''Sound and Glory'', planned concerts (such as a fall 1980 tour of Germany) and proposed recording sessions in New York and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] were cancelled, including a potential reunion with past members of the Comets.

Despite his illness, Haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]]. 
The October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley's British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that "Haley had taken a fit [and] didn't recognize anyone anymore." In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable.<ref name="Bill Haley 1982. page 154">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll''. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. p. 154, {{ISBN|0-8128-2909-3}}</ref>  Haley's widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, "It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card."<ref name=FallingComet/>

Haley returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]].  At this time, Haley's alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time, and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. "There were days we never saw him," said his daughter Martha Maria.<ref name=FallingComet/> In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, "It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking." After being picked up by the police in Harlingen several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, "This is pointless." She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.<ref name=FallingComet/>

Media reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982,<ref name="Bill Haley 1982">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll'', pp. 155-159, John Swenson. (1982. Pub. Stein and Day, 1982), {{ISBN|0-8128-2909-3}}</ref> Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives toward the end of his life in which he was semi-coherent. His first wife has been quoted as saying, "He would call you and ramble, dwelling on the past..." The biography also describes Haley painting the windows of his home black,<ref name="Bill Haley 1982"/> but there is little other information available about his final days.

Haley died in his sleep of an apparent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on February 9, 1981, at the age of 55, at his home in Harlingen, Texas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Haley of 'Rock Around the Clock' Fame Dies in Texas Home|author=Belcher, Jerry|work= Los Angeles Times|page=2|date=February 10, 1981}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/10/obituaries/bill-haley-55-dies-singer-band-leader.html "Obituary for Bill Haley"], ''New York Times'', February 10, 1981.</ref> He was discovered lying motionless on his bed by a friend who had stopped by to visit him.

In April 1981, Bill Haley & His Comets returned to the British musical charts once again when MCA Records (inheritors of the Decca catalogue) released "Haley's Golden Medley", a hastily compiled edit of the band's best-known hits in the style of the then-popular "[[Stars on 45]]" format. The single reached Number 50 in the UK but was not released in the United States.

In 1987, Bill Haley was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. At that time, supporting bands were not also named to the Hall of Fame. This policy was subsequently changed, and in 2012 a special committee of the Hall of Fame inducted the Comets. Bill Haley and His Comets were also inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. In June 2005, Bill Haley And His Comets were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/71-bill-haley-and-his-comets|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends – BILL HALEY AND HIS COMETS|website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> In July 2005, the surviving members of the 1954–55 Comets (see below) represented Haley when Bill Haley and His Comets were inducted into [[Guitar Center|Hollywood's Rockwalk]], a ceremony also attended by Haley's second wife and youngest daughter. The Comets placed their handprints in cement, leaving a space blank for Haley.

==The Comets==
More than 100 musicians performed with Bill Haley & His Comets between 1952 and Haley's death in 1981, many becoming fan favorites along the way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=Bill Haley Extra Page 2 |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011233205/http://rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=October 11, 2011 }}</ref> Several short-lived Comets reunions were attempted in the 1970s and 1980s, including one contingent (organized by [[Baltimore]]-based piano player [[Joey Welz]], who played piano for the Comets from 1962 to 1965<ref name="The Bill Haley Who's Who">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=The Bill Haley Who's Who |publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |access-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054809/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 }}</ref>) that appeared on ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'', and another run by an [[Elvis Presley]] impersonator, Joey Rand (this group later lost a legal action over the right to use the Comets name). Only one group was sent out to perform by Haley himself and his management and production company, consisting of musicians who had played with Haley throughout the 1960s and 1970s—lead guitarist "Nick Masters" (Mathias Nicholas Nastos), bassist Ray Cawley, singer Ray "Pudge" Parsons, and drummer Buddy Dee—and who had continued to perform as the Comets between gigs and during Haley's retirement. This group rerecorded "Rock Around the Clock" for the television series ''Happy Days''.<ref name="The Bill Haley Who's Who"/>

'''The Comets''', featuring musicians who performed with Haley in 1954–1955, reunited in 1987 and are still touring the world as of 2007, playing showrooms in the United States and Europe. They have also recorded a half-dozen albums for small labels in Europe and the United States. This version of the group has also been credited as '''Bill Haley's Original Comets''' and, in circumstances in which the use of the Comets name is in dispute, '''A Tribute to Bill Haley''' and '''The Original Band'''. The basic lineup of this group from 1987 to May 2006 was Marshall Lytle (bass), Joey Ambrose (sax), Johnny Grande (piano), Dick Richards (drums) and Franny Beecher (guitar). British singer Jacko Buddin augmented the group on vocals during most of their European tours, with Lytle taking over on vocals for US and Canadian tours beginning in 2000 and full-time in Europe in the mid-2000s. Since they connected with Klaus Kettner's Rock It Concerts (Germany) in 1991, they have played hundreds of shows all over Europe and have appeared on dozens of television shows. In March 2007 they opened the Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany.

Two additional groups claim the name '''Bill Haley's Comets''' and have extensively toured in the United States since forming in the 1980s: one originally led by Haley's 1965–68 drummer John "Bam-Bam" Lane, the other run by Al Rappa, who played bass for Haley off and on between late 1959 and early 1969. (The 1959 album "Strictly Instrumental" on Decca was Rappa's first recording session with Bill Haley & His Comets. Haley had used Rappa as a fill-in player on live gigs for several years prior to that.) Both these musicians claim [[trademark]] ownership of the name "Bill Haley's Comets"; this dates back to Lane and Rappa (during a period when they worked together as one band) winning a trademark infringement lawsuit against the aforementioned Joey Rand group in 1989. Both Rappa's and Lane's bands have, from time to time, recruited other former Comets for their lineups (for example, in 2005, Rappa joined forces with Joey Welz), but for the most part the bandleaders are the only regular members who have worked with Bill Haley directly. Lane died in 2007, but his group continues to perform, led by bandleader Lenny Longo, who has no direct connection with Bill Haley. Rappa incorporated numerous professional musicians from the southern Indiana area (Guitarist Warren Batts, Joe Esarey, Dave Matthews, Joe Denton, saxophonist John Urbina, bassist Jody Hamilton Miley (previous bassist with the George Jones Show), and others) to make a full band. Rappa performed his Upright Bass show before thousands in audiences all over the country. Members of Rappa's "Comets" went on to form the LocoMotion Showband and continued touring the United States without Rappa adding Galen Deig (Drums) and Jimmy Baze (Bass) before eventually disbanding. Esarey went on to graduate from Cedarville University and Luther Rice Theological Seminary. He has since pastored churches and produced his own saxophone instrumental albums. Several of the members are now active in a very popular Southern Indiana 50's / 60's band called The Duke Boys.

In March and July 2005, the members of the 1954–55 group, now billed as simply the Comets after decades of controversy over the use of the name, made several high-profile concert appearances in New York City and Los Angeles organized by [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] as part of celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of rock and roll, the release of ''Blackboard Jungle'', the 50th anniversary of "Rock Around the Clock" hitting Number 1, and the 80th birthday of Bill Haley.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-film-that-helped-launch-rock/ |title=The Film That Helped Launch Rock |work=CBS News |date=March 18, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091217/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/18/sunday/main681742.shtml |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |title=Rock 'N' Roll Turns 50 in July |publisher=Seniorjournal.com |date=June 29, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014044137/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |archive-date=October 14, 2011 }}</ref> During a concert at the [[Viper Room]] in [[West Hollywood]] on July 6, 2005, the Comets were joined on stage for one song by [[Gina Haley]], the youngest daughter of Bill Haley; at a similar appearance in March they were joined by Haley's eldest son, John W. Haley. The 1954–55 Comets were also joined on stage by Bill Haley Jr. during several appearances in 2005 at Bubba Mac's in Somers Point, New Jersey, and at a 2005 concert recognizing the tenure of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen at the Twin Bars in Gloucester City, New Jersey.

In 2006, the 1954–55 Comets spent much of the year in residence at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. Meanwhile, the John Lane edition of Bill Haley's Comets recorded an album in Tennessee in early 2006, which has yet to be released.

On June 2, 2006, Johnny Grande, keyboardist with the 1954–55 Comets and a founding member of the band, died after a short illness. The following month, 85-year-old guitarist [[Franny Beecher]] announced his retirement, though he was at one point announced as participating in an early 2007 tour of Germany. The three remaining original Comets (Lytle, Richards, and Ambrose) continued to perform in Branson with new musicians taking over the keyboard and lead guitar positions. During September 2006, [[PBS]] in the United States aired a series of programs videotaped in Branson during the spring of 2006; these shows include the last recorded performances of the complete Original Comets lineup, including Grande. Lytle died in 2013, Beecher in 2014. The last remaining members of the 1954–55 Comets, Dick Richards and Joey Ambrose, continued to perform as the Comets as of mid-2018, sometimes augmented by 1970s-era Comet Bill Turner on lead guitar.

John "Bam-Bam" Lane died on February 18, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra.html |title="EXTRA!"

'''William Knight Kirchen''' (born June 29, 1948) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was a member of [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] from 1967 to the mid-1970s and later worked with [[Nick Lowe]]. ''Guitar Player'' magazine described Kirchen as "Titan of The [[Telecaster]]" for his prowess on the guitar.

==Early life==
Kirchen was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] but grew up in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]<ref name="New Haven"/> where he attended [[Pioneer High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Ann Arbor High School]] and learned to play the trombone.<ref name="AllMusic">Pendragon, Jana [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-kirchen-mn0000069922 Biography] AllMusic. Retrieved June 11, 2012</ref> He met a folksinger named David Siglin, long-time manager of local folk music venue [[The Ark (folk venue)|The Ark]], and joined the local folk scene. While learning to play banjo and guitar, his musical interest began to extend beyond folk music and included the blues and various string bands.<ref name="AllMusic"/> During his student days at [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], Kirchen started a "psycho folk-rock" band and later a country band that included [[George Frayne]] and [[John Tichy]] which formed the basis for the [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen]] band.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

==Career==
[[Image:BillKirchenAldenTheater.jpg|left|thumb|Onstage at the Alden Theater, McLean, Virginia (2004)]]
In 1969, Kirchen took Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen to California and they developed a reputation as musical "outlaws" that were praised by other outlaw musicians and bands like [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[The Grateful Dead]] and the [[Allman Brothers Band]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's band  "played a collection of rock 'n' roll, hard-core country, boogie and rockabilly sounds produced in a "high-octane mix" that made them a "happening" group in the San Francisco Bay area.<ref name="Crosstown">[http://64.33.96.73/CrosstownArts/client_music/kirchen/bkabout.htm Bill Kirchen and Too Much Fun] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424045324/http://64.33.96.73/CrosstownArts/client_music/kirchen/bkabout.htm |date=April 24, 2010 }} Crosstown Arts. Retrieved June 13, 2012</ref>

Kirchen began to develop as guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and performer. He became known for his vocal and guitar work on such songs as "Mama Hated Diesels",  "Down to Seeds and Stems Again Blues" from the band's albums, ''Hot Licks, Cold Steel & Truckers' Favorites'' and ''Lost in the Ozone''.<ref name="AllMusic"/> His live performance work was captured on the 1973 album ''Live From Deep in the Heart of Texas'', recorded at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in 1973.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's Commander Cody band broke apart in 1976 and he formed a "swing orchestra" called the Moonlighters and began a decades-long collaboration with British musician [[Nick Lowe]].  Lowe produced the Moonlighters' second album ''Rush Hour'', and Kirchen toured with Lowe and joined him in the studio from time to time. During this period Kirchen also worked on albums with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Gene Vincent]], and [[Link Wray]].<ref name="AllMusic"/>

[[Image:BillKirchenBehindHead.jpg|right|thumb|Onstage in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] (2005)]]
Around 1986, Kirchen moved to the Washington, D.C. area and formed the band Too Much Fun with Dave Elliot on drums and John Previti on bass.  In 1996, the band won ten Washington Area Music Awards including Musician and Songwriter of the Year.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Crosstown"/> Kirchen became a contemporary and associate of many D.C. guitarists such as the late [[Danny Gatton]] and [[Roy Buchanan]], Link Wray, [[Tom Principato]], [[Evan Johns]], [[Billy Hancock]], Linwood Taylor, Dave Chappell, [[Jimmy Thackery]], the Nighthawks and others who, during this time, forged an elite fraternity of Washington D.C. area roots rock performers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Kirchen recorded the album ''Tombstone Every Mile'' on Demon Records, while in England and then released the recording in the USA after he signed with Black Top Records in 1994.<ref name="AllMusic"/> He released the critically acclaimed and musically eclectic album, ''Have Love, Will Travel'' in 1996 and ''Raise a Ruckus'' on [[Hightone Records]] in 1999.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen followed up with more album releases on Hightone Records including ''Tied to the Wheel'' in 2001, ''Dieselbilly Road Trip'' in 2003, and ''King of Dieselbilly'' (2005).

In 2006, Bill kicked off his new deal with [[Proper Records]] by recording "Hammer of the Honky-Tonk Gods" at their London studio. The band on the album was Nick Lowe, [[Geraint Watkins]] and [[Robert Trehern]] and it was engineered by [[Paul Riley (musician)|Paul Riley]].

This was followed in 2010 by another album – "Word to the Wise", once again recorded at Proper's studio in London by Paul Riley, with a band comprising [[Austin de Lone]], [[Jonny Castle]] and [[Jack O'Dell (musician)|Jack O'Dell]]. The record featured many guests including: [[Paul Carrack]], Elvis Costello, [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[Blackie Farrell]], [[Dan Hicks (singer)|Dan Hicks]], Nick Lowe, [[Maria Muldaur]] and more.

In November 2012, Kirchen was a guest performer on [[Larry Monroe (radio personality)|Larry Monroe]]'s Texas Radio Live show on [[KDRP-LP|KDRP]].

2013 saw the third Proper Records album released – also recorded in London by Paul Riley.  The band on "Seeds And Stems" was Jack O'Dell and Maurice Cridlin with guest appearances from Austin de Lone and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] among others.

===Legacy===
Allmusic's Jana Pendragon credits Kirchen with being one of the musicians that pioneered the [[Americana music|Americana]] movement in the 1980s, and also with being a founding father of "twangcore," along with [[Dave Alvin]], [[Wilco]] and [[Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> Kirchen's signature sound has been dubbed "dieselbilly" and incorporates elements of [[country music|country]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[Western swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]], laced with themes of American truck driving music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Kirchen's work in the early 1970s with Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen helped set the stage for the singers like [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] and other [[outlaw country]] bands with his recordings of songs like "Seeds And Stems."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanamusicshow.com/episode159 |title=Bill Kirchen – Interview and Music |publisher=Americana Music Show |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2014}}</ref> Kirchen is said to have "one of the most distinctive, pure-Fender Telecaster tone guitar sounds in modern music".<ref name="New Haven"/>

Kirchen was named "The Titan of The Telecaster"  by ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine<ref name="New Haven"/> for his musical prowess on the [[Fender Telecaster]] guitar. He played a 1959 model with a maple fretboard and sunburst finish that he calls the "coal burner", acquired in 1967 when he exchanged his [[Gibson SG]] with a stranger on a bus.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Vintage Guitar Magazine|title=Bill Kirchen|date=November 2001|author=Ward Meeker}}</ref> He eventually retired that guitar.

==Personal life==
Kirchen is a father and has been married for more than 25 years.<ref name="AllMusic"/> In 2005 he moved to the West Coast and then to [[Manchaca, Texas]]. In early 2007, he returned to Maryland,{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} then subsequently moved to Austin, Texas in 2011.

===Solo career, 1990s–present===
In 1992, Burnette signed with [[Capricorn Records]], which issued ''Coming Home''.<ref name="Bush" /> Although "Nothing to Do (and All Night to Do It)" was not on the album, it reached No. 64 on the ''Billboard'' country chart. Many of the songs from ''Coming Home'' were featured in Burnette's acting debut in the film ''Saturday Night Special''. Between 1994 and 1998, he appeared in the films ''Not Like Us'', ''[[Carnosaur 3: Primal Species]]'', ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'', ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', and ''[[Richie Rich's Christmas Wish]]''.

In 1999, he signed with Grand Avenue Records and released ''All Night Long''. ''Are You With Me Baby'', a rockabilly album, followed on the Free Falls Entertainment label. The album had one cover, "[[Believe What You Say]]". Between 2001 and 2005, he covered "[[Copperhead Road]]" by [[Steve Earle]] and "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" by [[Johnny Cash]].

===With Fleetwood Mac===
Burnette met [[Mick Fleetwood]] during a taping of [[Dick Clark]]'s anniversary special. A few months later, Fleetwood invited him to join the band The Zoo.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> For the Zoo's album ''I'm Not Me'' ([[RCA Records|RCA]], 1983) Burnette sang lead vocals on "I'm Not Me"; "Angel Come Home", a Beach Boys song; "Gimme You", a cover of his own song; and "Tear It Up", written by his father.

In 1982, the Zoo performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as the backing band for [[Lindsey Buckingham]], guitarist and singer for Fleetwood Mac. In 1984, Burnette co-wrote the song "So Excited" with [[Christine McVie]], who sang and played keyboards in Fleetwood Mac. The song appeared on McVie's solo album, and Burnette appeared with her on MTV for ''Christine McVie: The Video Album''. He sang on the song "Are You Mine" with [[Stevie Nicks]], another Fleetwood Mac vocalist. The song was intended for Nicks's album ''Rock a Little'' but was not included. McVie and Fleetwood performed on Burnette's album ''Try Me'' ([[Curb Records|Curb]], 1985).<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Two songs cracked the ''Billboard'' country charts: "Try Me" and "Ain't It Just Like Love"

When Lindsey Buckingham and Fleetwood Mac parted ways in 1987, Burnette and guitarist [[Rick Vito]] were asked to join the band.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> After the [[Shake the Cage Tour|Shake the Cage tour]], Fleetwood Mac released a ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album (1988), featuring two new songs with Burnette and Vito: "[[As Long as You Follow]]" and "[[No Questions Asked (song)|No Questions Asked]]". For their next album, ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]'', Burnette wrote "Hard Feelings" and "When It Comes to Love" and co-wrote "[[In the Back of My Mind (Fleetwood Mac song)|In the Back of My Mind]]", "Do You Know", and "When the Sun Goes Down".

Vito and Nicks left Fleetwood Mac at the end of 1991 and Christine McVie decided to retire from touring. Burnette helped Fleetwood Mac bassist [[John McVie]] with his first solo album. Burnette left Fleetwood Mac in early 1993 to pursue a solo and acting career.   In 1994, Burnette reunited with Fleetwood Mac. The band featured two new members, vocalist [[Bekka Bramlett]] and guitarist [[Dave Mason]]. The band toured in 1994 and 1995, and then released the album ''[[Time (Fleetwood Mac album)|Time]]'' (1995) on October 10, 1995.  Burnette wrote "Talkin' to My Heart" and "I Got It in for You" with [[Deborah Allen]]. With Bramlett he wrote "Dreamin' the Dream".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=2023-03-09 |title=What It Was Like to Replace Stevie Nicks in Fleetwood Mac |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bekka-bramlett-fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-1234688286/ |access-date=2023-04-28 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>

He has made numerous recordings, primarily in the [[rockabilly]] genre but also has a large body of recorded work in [[rock 'n' roll]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[country music]]. He performed live primarily in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area, but also played regularly at European roots music festivals.

==Early life==
Hancock was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and raised in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], where he has lived most of his life.  He attended George Washington High School in Alexandria, graduating in 1964. He came from a musical family. His maternal grandmother Katie sang with Minstrel shows in black face accompanying herself on piano and harmonica. Two of his aunts Eileen and Anita were a singing duo in the 1940s who sang at two or three Washington DC radios stations on a regular basis. His paternal grandfather Mitchell (Mitch) Hancock played mandolin from about 1897 until 1902. He often played on River Boats in New Orleans and recorded for the Edison Label. Billy's father worked for the Southern Railway and his mother worked for Waxie Maxie's, a local record store chain, and other record stores. The records his mother brought home from work, primarily rhythm and blues from the late 1940s, played a large and influential role in his musical development.

==Career==
Hancock began his career playing in bands around Washington, D.C., while still a teenager. After graduating from high school, he played with bands in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] before returning to the Washington area. In 1968, he moved to [[Baltimore]] to attend the [[Peabody Conservatory]], and continued to play in bands in the Baltimore area.

In the early 1970s, Hancock began a collaboration with [[Danny Gatton]] and they formed Danny and the Fat Boys with Hancock (bass, vocals), Gatton (guitars), and Dave Elliott (drums, vocals). In 1975, the group released ''American Music'' on a label owned by Hancock and his brother. The album's title was taken from a rhythm and blues song Hancock had written. It was later re-issued on CD.

In 1978, Hancock recorded four rockabilly songs under the name Billy Hancock and the Tennessee Rockets for [[Ripsaw Records]], a small independent label. He continued to record rockabilly for Ripsaw under that name for two years. Ripsaw released four singles during that time and licensed those and other titles to larger labels both in the U.S. and France. It is these rockabilly recordings for which Hancock is known internationally.

In 1983, Hancock recorded another rockabilly record, "Hey! Little Rock And Roller", that was released in France on the Big Beat Label. Later that year, he returned to Ripsaw to record various rock and roll songs, six of which Ripsaw released in 1985. All of the Ripsaw material was later released on CDs by Finnish Bluelight Records.

Throughout his career, Hancock played in backing bands for prominent musicians, including [[Fats Domino]], [[Gene Vincent]], blues guitarist [[Roy Buchanan]], rockabilly [[Charlie Feathers]], [[the Clovers]], [[Amos Milburn]], and country musicians [[Dottie West]] and [[Jean Shepard]]. He co-produced and played guitar on [[Tex Rubinowitz]]'s rockabilly song "Hot Rod Man."

In 2002, Hancock and his brother the television director, Dale Hancock founded Turkey Mountain Records, an independent record label. The label was formed to find and promote talented artists of all genres who, for whatever reasons, have been ignored by other record labels. Their Archival Series re-released material on artists of the past whose works have been unavailable until now. Turkey Mountain Records' roster of artists included: Danny Gatton, The British Walkers (featuring Roy Buchanan), Bobbie (The Kid) Howard with Link Wray and The Ray Men, Charlie Feathers, The Fallen Angels, and Billy Hancock himself.

In 2005, the [[Washington Area Music Association]] WAMA awarded Hancock a Special Recognition Award for his 40-plus years as a vocalist, musician, songwriter, producer, promoter, and label owner. In 2006, WAMA presented him with two "Wammie" awards for 2005 Roots Rock Vocalist and Roots Rock Recording.  In 2012, WAMA presented Hancock as one of "The Fallen Angels" a special recognition award.

In 2010, Hancock was inducted into the Southern Legends Hall of Fame. He is already a member of three other International Halls of Fame.

Hancock was also the television host for ''American Music'' in Arlington, Virginia, where he interviewed and showcased songwriters and a music historian.

He was also a member of the resurrected art rock group from the sixties, The Fallen Angels.

On 4 November 2012 Hancock was inducted into The Northern Virginia Blues Society, Blues Hall of Fame in Manassas, Va.

'''Robert Glynn Luman''' (April 15, 1937 – December 27, 1978)<ref name="LarkinGE"/> was an American [[Country music|country]] and [[rockabilly]] singer-songwriter.

==Early life and career==
Luman was born in [[Blackjack, Texas|Blackjack]], Texas, United States,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> though was raised in [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], Texas.  His early interest in music was influenced by his father, an amateur [[fiddle]], [[guitar]] and [[harmonica]] player.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Bob Luman received his first guitar when he was thirteen years of age.<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/flu22|title=LUMAN, ROBERT GLYNN [BOB]|publisher=The Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association | date= September 2, 2008|access-date= September 2, 2008 }}</ref>

Luman attended high school in [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]], where the family had moved after young Bob's birth and started his first band while in high school.<ref name=TSHA/>

Luman had been a baseball star at his high school and tried out with the [[Major League Baseball]] [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], but when he did not make it in professional baseball, he decided to concentrate on his music.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In 1956, he won a [[talent contest]] promoted by the [[Future Farmers of America]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which earned him an appearance on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''.<ref name=TSHA/>

For the ''Hayride'', Luman formed a [[backup band]] called the Shadows, including [[James Burton]] on guitar, [[James Kirkland (musician)|James Kirkland]] on bass and Butch White on drums.  In 1957, the band signed with [[Imperial Records]], where they recorded "All Night Long" (b/w "Red Cadillac and a Black Mustache") and "Amarillo Blues."<ref name=TSHA/>

That same year, the band appeared on the ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' in Los Angeles, and appeared in the movie ''[[Carnival Rock]]'', where they backed up [[David Houston (singer)|David Houston]].<ref name=TSHA/>

The following year, having been dropped by Imperial Records, Luman signed with [[Capitol Records]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares."  Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name, which he refused to do, so he left the record label and signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta."<ref name=TSHA/>

In 1960, Luman was inducted into the [[United States Army]].  It was while still serving in the Army Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover [[chart-topper|hit]], "[[Let's Think About Living]],"<ref name="LarkinGE"/> a [[novelty song]] that hit No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] and No.&nbsp;9 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[country music]] chart.<ref name=TSHA/> It also reached the Top 10 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

After leaving the Army in 1962, Luman moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

On August 12, 1964, he married Barbara in Yuma, Colorado.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 1965, he joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=TSHA/>

==Later career==
Luman toured frequently in the 1960s and 1970s, and became popular in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], with an act that combined country and rockabilly.  He signed with [[Epic Records]] in 1968, and had several hits with them, including "[[Lonely Women Make Good Lovers]]" and "Still Loving You."<ref name=TSHA/>  "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" became his biggest country hit, hitting No.&nbsp;4 on the country chart. ([[Steve Wariner]], who had earlier been a member of Luman's band, later covered the song in 1984, and he, too, took it to No.&nbsp;4 on the country charts.)

Luman's other country hits included "[[Ain't Got Time to Be Unhappy]]," (1968) "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with [[Autry Inman]], 1968), "[[When You Say Love]]" (1972), "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973), "Proud Of You Baby" (1975), and "[[The Pay Phone]]" (1977).<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  Perhaps his most unusual song was a slow, soulful recitation of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[I Still Miss Someone]]."

Luman died of pneumonia in Nashville in late December 1978.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1533}}</ref>  He was 41 years old.  After his death, [[Bear Family Records]] released several compilations of his songs, including ''More of the Rocker'', ''Still Rockin''' and ''Carnival Rock''.<ref name=TSHA/>

==Legacy==
Luman is a member of both the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] and the [[Texas Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name=TSHA/>

His song "[[Lonely Women Make Good Lovers]]" was featured in the 1988 drama film ''[[Rain Man]]''.

'''Robert Lee Helms''' (August 15, 1933 – June 19, 1997) was an American [[Country music|country]] singer, who is best remembered for his 1957 [[Christmas music|Christmas hit]] "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]". Additionally, he had two other hit records from that year: "[[Fraulein (song)|Fraulein]]" and "[[My Special Angel]]".

==Life and career==
Robert Lee Helms was born in 1933 in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] (some sources say nearby [[Helmsburg, Indiana|Helmsburg]]), the son of Hildreth Esther (née Abram) and Fred Robert Helms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=Bobby Helms Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-helms-mn0000063722|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=15 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvFJDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Hildreth+Esther+Abram+Helms+and+Fred+Robert+Helms%22&pg=PA376|title=A Year of Indiana History - Book 1: 366 Indiana History Stories|first=Paul R.|last=Wonning|publisher=Mossy Feet Books|page=376|via=Google Books}}</ref> His family was musical. Helms began performing as a [[duet (music)|duo]] with his [[sibling|brother]], Freddie, before going on to a successful [[solo (music)|solo]] career in country music. In 1956, Helms made his way to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], where he signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Decca Records]], and achieved multiple successes the following year. His first [[single (music)|single]] in 1957, titled "[[Fraulein (song)|Fraulein]]", went to No. 1 on the country music [[record chart|chart]] and made it into the [[Top 40]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100#History|''Billboard'' Best Sellers in Stores]] chart. Later that same year, he released "[[My Special Angel]]", which also hit No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts and entered the [[Top 40|Top 10]] on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[pop music]] chart, peaking at No. 7. It sold over one million copies, earning a [[music recording certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd

His song "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]", which was released in the late fall of 1957, produced by Paul Cohen<ref>Decca Records</ref> was a big [[chart-topper|hit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2014/12/16/jingle-bell-rock-hoosier-bobby-helms/20477989/|author=Lindquist, David|title=''Jingle Bell Rock'' cemented legacy for Hoosier Bobby Helms|website=IndyStar.com|publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref> and was being played and danced to on [[Dick Clark]]'s teen dance show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' by mid-December of that year. It also re-emerged in four out of the next five years, and sold so well that it repeated each time as a top hit, becoming a Christmas classic still played today. (In 2016, it was rated radio's third most-played Christmas song, according to StationIntel).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideradio.com/all-christmas-stations-start-strategy-with-classics/article_b057fa36-bddf-11e6-8354-ffd2060f03d0.html|title=All-Christmas Stations Start Strategy With Classics.|website=Insideradio.com|date=9 December 2016 }}</ref> It took five years for the song to become a second million-seller for Helms.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/102 102]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/102}}</ref> It reached No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and spent 21 weeks on the [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2"/>  The [[gramophone record|record]] gained [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2"/> At the end of a television performance of the song toward the end of his life, Helms said, “I didn’t want to do the song when they first brought it to me, but now I'm sure glad I did.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPkheJRt_Q |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/UiPkheJRt_Q| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Jingle Bell Rock|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=March 2021}} [[American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[AllMusic]] list the writers of the song as Joseph Beal, Joseph Carlton, James Ross, and James Boothe.

Another record by Helms was "Schoolboy Crush", which was a hit in the UK. It was released in the United States on June 23, 1958, on Decca. The same song was then covered by UK teen star [[Cliff Richard]] about the same time as the UK release.

Helms continued touring and [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] for the next three decades. His pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Helms suffered from emphysema, asthma, diabetes, and stomach problems. He began wearing an eye patch after losing sight in his right eye. He was a longtime resident of [[Martinsville, Indiana]], until his death from complications from emphysema at the age of 63 on June 19, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1996 - 1997 |website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Brenda Mae Tarpley was born on December 11, 1944,<ref name=Dynamite /> in the charity ward of [[Grady Hospital]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to parents Annie Grayce (née Yarbrough; 1921–2006) and Ruben Lindsey Tarpley (1909–1953).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee Biography |url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/brenda-lee-biography |access-date=December 3, 2023 |publisher=PBS |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203094350/https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/brenda-lee-biography |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944 |title=Brenda Lee (b. 1944) |encyclopedia=New Georgia Encyclopedia |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=May 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526222803/https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944 |url-status=live }}</ref> She weighed 4 pounds 11 ounces at birth. Lee attended grade schools wherever her father found work, primarily between Atlanta and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]. Her family was poor. As a child, she shared a bed with her brother and sister in a series of three-room houses without running water. Life centered on her parents finding work, their family, and the [[Baptists|Baptist church]], where she began singing solos every Sunday.<ref name=Dynamite /><ref name=IMDB_TV>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456820/|title=Brenda Lee: Little Miss Dynamite|website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 11, 2019|archive-date=February 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208052516/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456820/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Though her family did not have indoor plumbing until after her father's death, they had a battery-powered table radio that fascinated Brenda as a baby.<ref name=Dynamite /> Both her mother and sister remembered taking her repeatedly to a local candy store before she turned three.

[[File:Brenda Lee with Elvis Presley in 1957.webp|thumb|Lee with [[Elvis Presley]] in 1957]]
===Child performer===
Lee's voice, face and stage presence won her wider attention from a young age. At age five, she won first place at her school's talent show contest, where she sang "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]". Her performance generated positive reviews, leading her to make regular appearances on local radio and television shows.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee |url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/brenda-lee |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum |language=en |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203094350/https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/brenda-lee |url-status=live }}</ref>

Her father died in 1953 (when she was 8 years old) in a construction accident, and by the time she turned ten, she was the primary breadwinner of her family through singing at events and on local radio and television shows.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=New Georgia Encyclopedia |language=en-US |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203094351/https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During that time, she appeared regularly on the country music show ''TV Ranch'' on [[WAGA-TV]] in Atlanta; she was so short, the host would lower a stand microphone as low as it would go and stand her up on a wooden crate to reach it. In 1955, Grayce Tarpley was remarried to Buell "Jay" Rainwater, who moved the family to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], Ohio, where he worked at the [[Jimmie Skinner]] Music Center. Lee performed with Skinner at the record shop on two Saturday programs broadcast over Newport, Kentucky, radio station [[WNOP (AM)|WNOP]]. The family soon returned to Georgia, but this time to [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], and Lee appeared on the show ''The Peach Blossom Special'' on [[WJAT|WJAT-AM]] in [[Swainsboro, Georgia|Swainsboro]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee |url=https://www.classicbands.com/brendalee.html |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=www.classicbands.com |archive-date=January 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125043111/http://www.classicbands.com/brendalee.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===National exposure and stardom===
Lee's breakthrough came in February 1955, when she turned down $30 ($334 in 2022 value<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 19, 2008 |title=Consumer Price Index Data from 1913 to 2022 {{!}} US Inflation Calculator |url=https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/ |access-date=November 28, 2022 |website=www.usinflationcalculator.com |language=en-US |archive-date=September 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922120528/https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/ |url-status=live }}</ref>) to appear on a Swainsboro radio station to see [[Red Foley]] and a touring promotional unit of his ABC-TV program ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in Augusta. An Augusta [[disc jockey]] persuaded Foley to hear her sing before the show. Foley did and agreed to let her perform "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]" on stage that night, unrehearsed. Foley later recounted the moments following her introduction:

{{Pull quote|I still get cold chills thinking about the first time I heard that voice. One foot started patting rhythm as though she was stomping out a prairie fire but not another muscle in that little body even as much as twitched. And when she did that trick of breaking her voice, it jarred me out of my trance enough to realize I'd forgotten to get off the stage. There I stood, after 26 years of supposedly learning how to conduct myself in front of an audience, with my mouth open two miles wide and a glassy stare in my eyes. <ref>Jim Wesley, ''Radio Express'' (2011), p. 58.</ref>

}}

On March 31, 1955, the 10-year-old made her network debut on ''Ozark Jubilee'' in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Although her five-year contract with the show was broken by a 1957 lawsuit brought by her mother and her manager,<ref>{{citation|first1=Brenda|last1=Lee|first2=Robert K.|last2=Oermann|first3=Julie|last3=Clay|title=Little Miss Dynamite: the Life and Times of Brenda Lee|publisher=Hyperion|year=2002|isbn=0-7868-8558-0|url=https://archive.org/details/littlemissdynami00bren}}</ref> she nevertheless made regular appearances on the program throughout its run.

Less than two months later, on July 30, 1956, [[Decca Records]] offered her a contract, and her first record was "Jambalaya", backed with "Bigelow 6-200". Lee's second single featured two novelty Christmas tunes: "I'm Gonna Lasso Santa Claus", and "Christy Christmas". Though she turned 12 on December 11, 1956, both of the first two Decca singles credit her as "Little Brenda Lee (9 Years Old)".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sexton |first=Paul |date=July 30, 2023 |title=Brenda Lee's 'Jambalaya': Little Miss Dynamite Debuts On The Bayou |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/brenda-lee-jambalaya-song/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=uDiscover Music |language=en-US |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203143508/https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/brenda-lee-jambalaya-song/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Neither of the 1956 releases charted, but her first issue in 1957, "[[One Step at a Time (Brenda Lee song)|One Step at a Time]]", written by Hugh Ashley, became a hit in both the pop and country fields. Her next hit, "Dynamite", coming out of a 4-foot 9-inch frame, led to her lifelong nickname, Little Miss Dynamite.<ref name=Dynamite />

Lee first attracted attention performing in country music venues and shows; however, her label and management felt it best to market her exclusively as a pop artist, the result being that none of her best-known recordings from the 1960s were released to country radio, and despite her country sound, with top Nashville session people, she did not have another country hit until 1969 with "[[Johnny One Time]]".{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

===Biggest successes: 1958–1966===
[[File:Brenda Lee - Cash Box 1960.jpg|thumb|Lee presented with a [[Music recording sales certification|Gold record]] for "I'm Sorry", cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'', August 27, 1960]]
Lee achieved her biggest success on the [[Record chart|pop charts]] in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s with [[rockabilly]] and [[rock and roll]]-styled songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brendalee.com/pages/biography.html |title=Brenda Lee: the Lady, the Legend|publisher=Brenda Lee Productions|access-date=April 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414094639/http://www.brendalee.com/pages/biography.html |archive-date=April 14, 2009}}</ref> Her biggest hits included "Jambalaya", "[[Sweet Nothin's]]" (No.&nbsp;4, written by country musician [[Ronnie Self]]), "I Want to Be Wanted" (No.&nbsp;1), "[[All Alone Am I]]" (No.&nbsp;3) and "[[Fool No. 1|Fool #1]]" (No.&nbsp;3). She had more hits with the more pop-based songs "[[That's All You Gotta Do]]" (No.&nbsp;6), "[[Emotions (Brenda Lee song)|Emotions]]" (No.&nbsp;7), "[[You Can Depend on Me (Louis Armstrong song)|You Can Depend on Me]]" (No.&nbsp;6), "[[Dum Dum (Brenda Lee song)|Dum Dum]]" (No.&nbsp;4), 1962's "[[Break It to Me Gently]]" (No.&nbsp;2), "[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]" (No.&nbsp;6), and "[[As Usual]]" (No.&nbsp;12). Lee's total of nine consecutive top 10 ''Billboard'' Hot 100 hits from "That's All You Gotta Do" in 1960 through "All Alone Am I" in 1962 set a record for a female solo artist that was not equaled until 1986 by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

The biggest-selling track of Lee's career was a [[Christmas]] song. In 1958, when she was 13, producer [[Owen Bradley]] asked her to record a new song by [[Johnny Marks]], who had had success writing Christmas tunes for country singers, most notably "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" ([[Gene Autry]]) and "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]" ([[Burl Ives]]). Lee recorded the song, "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]", in July with a prominent twanging guitar part by [[Hank Garland]] and raucous sax soloing by Nashville icon [[Boots Randolph]]. Decca released it as a single that November, but it sold only 5,000 copies, and did not do much better when it was released again in 1959.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/103 103]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/103}}</ref> However, over subsequent years, it eventually sold more than five million copies. Since 2017, the song has appeared at the end of each year on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, having spent (as of December 9, 2023) 54 weeks on the Hot 100, peaking at number 1 in 2023.

In 1960, Lee recorded her [[signature song]], "[[I'm Sorry (Brenda Lee song)|I'm Sorry]]", however, the record  initially was withheld for months before its release due to concern that the 15-year-old Lee would not understand what she was singing about in the love song. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1960, reaching the #1 chart position in the U.S. and #12 in the U.K.<ref>{{Cite web |last=hanspostcard |date=December 2, 2019 |title=Billboard #1 Hits: #32: 'I'm Sorry'- Brenda Lee- July 18, 1960 |url=https://slicethelife.com/2019/12/02/billboard-1-hits-32-im-sorry-brenda-lee-july-18-1960/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |website=slicethelife |language=en |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203143508/https://slicethelife.com/2019/12/02/billboard-1-hits-32-im-sorry-brenda-lee-july-18-1960/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=tolsen |date=January 2, 2013 |title=Billboard Hot 100™ |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US |archive-date=December 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211227031046/https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was her first gold single and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/awards/3rd-annual-grammy-awards |title=3rd Annual Grammy Awards |publisher=[[Grammy Awards]] |access-date=2024-06-18}}</ref> Even though it was not released as a country song, it was among the first big hits to use what was to become the [[Nashville sound]]&nbsp;– a string orchestra and [[legato]] harmonized background vocals.

Her last top ten single on the pop charts in the United States (besides the reappearance each November–December since 2017 of "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree") was 1963's "[[Losing You (Brenda Lee song)|Losing You]]" (No.&nbsp;6). 

In 1964, "[[As Usual]]" reached No.&nbsp;12 in the US and No.&nbsp;5 in the UK and "[[Coming on Strong (song)|Coming on Strong]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;11 in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} Also in 1964, "[[Is It True (Brenda Lee song)|Is It True]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;17 in both the US and the UK.

The slide guitar and background singers were overdubbed in Nashville. It was recorded at Decca Records' number two studio at their West Hampstead complex, as was the UK B-side, a version of Ray Charles' 1959 classic cut, "[[What'd I Say]]?", which was not released in North America.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brenda Lee – Is It True / What'd I Say {{!}} Releases {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/350095-Brenda-Lee-Is-It-True-Whatd-I-Say |access-date=June 28, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>  "Is It True" was composed by noted British songwriting team [[Ken Lewis (songwriter)|Ken Lewis]] and [[John Carter (English musician)|John Carter]], who were also members of UK hitmakers the [[The Ivy League (band)|Ivy League]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Ivy League {{!}} Allmusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ivy-league-mn0000069393 |access-date=June 28, 2024 |website=Allmusic}}</ref>

===International fame===
[[File:Brenda-Lee and Peter Denton.jpg|thumb|Brenda Lee at the Granada, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], April 1962]]
Lee was popular in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] from early in her career. She performed on television in the UK in 1959, before she had achieved much pop recognition in the United States. Her first hit single in the UK was "[[Sweet Nothin's]]", which reached No.&nbsp;4 on the UK singles chart in the spring of 1960. She subsequently had a UK hit (in 1961) with "[[Let's Jump the Broomstick]]", a rockabilly number recorded in 1959, which had not charted in the United States, but reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=Bernstein />

Lee had two Top Ten hits in the UK that were not released as singles in her native country: the first, "[[Speak to Me Pretty]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 in May 1962 and was her greatest hit in the UK by chart placing, swiftly followed by "[[Here Comes That Feeling]]", which reached No.&nbsp;5 in the summer of 1962. The latter was issued as the B-side to "[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]" in the United States (which peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100); however, "Here Comes That Feeling" also made an appearance in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at No.&nbsp;89, despite its B-side status in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

In 1962, while touring [[West Germany]], Lee appeared at the [[Star-Club]], [[Hamburg]], with the Beatles as the opening act.<ref name=Bernstein /> Lee also had big hits in the UK with "[[All Alone Am I]]" (No.&nbsp;7 in 1963) and "[[As Usual]]" (No.&nbsp;5 in 1964).{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Lee first visited England for three days in April 1959 as a last-minute replacement on ''[[Oh Boy! (TV series)|Oh Boy!]]''. She first toured the UK in March and April 1962 with [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Sounds Incorporated]] (as her backing group), and she toured the country for a second time in March 1963, this time supported by [[the Bachelors]], [[Sounds Incorporated]], [[Tony Sheridan]], and [[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Lee also toured in [[Ireland]] in 1963 and appeared on the front cover of the Irish dancing and entertainment magazine ''Spotlight'' in April that year.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

After appearing at the annual [[Royal Variety Performance]] before [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[London Palladium]] on November 2, 1964, Lee toured [[UK|Britain]] again in November and December 1964, supported by (amongst others) [[Manfred Mann]], [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates]], [[the John Barry Seven]], [[Wayne Fontana]] & [[the Mindbenders]], [[Marty Wilde]], [[the Tornados]] and [[Heinz (singer)|Heinz Burt]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

=== 1970–1992 ===
[[File:Brenda Lee 1977.JPG|thumb|Lee in 1977]]
During the early 1970s, Lee re-established herself as a country music artist. In a 1996 [[memoir]], [[television producer]] Sam Lovullo stated that Lee's 1972 appearance on his [[variety show]] ''[[Hee Haw]]'' had been instrumental to her [[Comeback (publicity)|comeback]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lovullo |first1=Sam |last2=Eliot |first2=Marc |date=1996 |title=Life in the Kornfield: My 25 Years at ''Hee Haw'' |location=New York |publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group |isbn= 1-57297-028-6 |quote=Brenda Lee ... faded from the charts, until ''Hee Haw'' brought her back. Her appearance on our show was the key to reestablishing her career. |quote-page=126}}</ref> Lee earned a string of top ten hits in the United States on the country charts, the first of which was 1973's "[[Nobody Wins (Brenda Lee song)|Nobody Wins]]", which reached the top five that spring and became her last Top 100 pop hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;70. The follow-up, the [[Mark James (songwriter)|Mark James]] composition "[[Sunday Sunrise (song)|Sunday Sunrise]]", reached No.&nbsp;6 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]''{{'s}} Hot Country Singles chart that October. Other major hits included "[[Wrong Ideas]]" and "[[Big Four Poster Bed]]" (1974); and "Rock on Baby" and "[[She's My Rock|He's My Rock]]" (both 1975).

After a few years of lesser hits, Lee began another run at the top ten with 1979's "[[Tell Me What It's Like]]". Two follow-ups also reached the Top 10 in 1980: "[[The Cowgirl and the Dandy]]" and "[[Broken Trust]]" (the latter featuring vocal backing by [[the Oak Ridge Boys]]). A 1982 album, ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', featuring Lee along with [[Dolly Parton]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]], was a surprise hit, reaching the top ten on the U.S. country albums chart.

'''Charles Hardin Holley''' (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959), known as '''Buddy Holly''', was an American singer, songwriter and musician who was a central and pioneering figure of mid-1950s [[rock and roll]]. He was born to a musical family in [[Lubbock, Texas]], during the [[Great Depression]], and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. Holly's style was country and western music which he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school.

Holly made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group Buddy and Bob with his friend [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]]. In 1955, after opening for [[Elvis Presley]] as part of the Louisiana Hayride's habit of seeking out local bands to add to the show, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. Subsequently, he played with Presley three times that year and his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when Holly opened for [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], he was spotted by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with [[Decca Records]].

Holly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by [[Owen Bradley]], who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like [[Patsy Cline]]. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], and recorded a demo of "[[That'll Be the Day]]", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to [[Brunswick Records]], which released it as a single credited to [[The Crickets]], a name chosen by the band to subvert Decca's contract limitations. It became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, "That'll Be the Day" topped the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|US]] and [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, "[[Peggy Sue]]".

The album ''[[The "Chirping" Crickets]]'', released in November 1957, reached number five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Holly made his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), famed session musician [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), and embarked on a tour of the mid-western US. After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper]], and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by [[Don McLean]] as "[[The Day the Music Died]]" in his song "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]".

During his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums.  This was unfounded considering he first saw Elvis with this line-up in Lubbock in 1955 when Holly was strictly a country music band. Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Brian May]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[the Hollies]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Marshall Crenshaw]], [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Elton John]]. Holly was among the first artists inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in 1986. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of 100 Greatest Artists in 2010. Holly was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=swieser@panolawatchman.com |first=Stella Wieser |date=2022-08-10 |title=Texas Country Music Hall of Fame announces 2022 inductees |url=https://www.panolawatchman.com/news/texas-country-music-hall-of-fame-announces-2022-inductees/article_359dcf74-16de-11ed-9286-4396dc593295.html |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=Panola Watchman |language=en}}</ref>

==Life and career==
===Early life and career (1936–1955)===
Charles Hardin Holley (spelled "-ey") was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], on September 7, 1936, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Odell "L.O." Holley (1901–1985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902–1990).

Buddy Holly was baptized a Baptist, and the family were members of the Tabernacle Baptist Church.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=12}}

The Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the bow so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=13}} During World War II, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, at his mother's urging, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a [[steel guitar]], but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought him an acoustic guitar from a local pawnshop, and he learned how to play it from Travis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=14}}

During his early childhood, Holly was influenced by the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Bob Wills]], and the [[Carter Family]]. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, Holly became friends with [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]], and the two played together, practicing with songs by [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[Johnnie & Jack]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=34}} They both listened to the radio programs ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]], ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], and ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. At the same time, Holly played with other musicians he met in high school, including [[Sonny Curtis]] and [[Jerry Allison]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|p=80|2007}} In 1952 Holly and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as Buddy and Jack in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Bob Montgomery, and they were billed as Buddy and Bob. They soon started performing on the ''Sunday Party'' show on [[KDAV]] in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=6|2003}} At that time, Holly was influenced by late-night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues (R&B). He would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier [[country and western]] influence with R&B.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}} We do know it wasn't until Holly saw Elvis in Lubbock that led him to follow the Presley example.

By 1955, after graduating from [[Lubbock High School]], Holly decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley perform live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holly opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, Holly had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from country and western to [[rock and roll]] due to seeing Presley's performances and hearing his music.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} In October, Stone booked Bill Haley & His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded [[Grand Ole Opry]] manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], who signed the band to [[Decca Records]] in February 1956.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|p=130|1997}} In the contract, Decca misspelled Holly's surname as "Holly", and from then on he was known as Buddy Holly, instead of his real name Holley.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

On January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by [[Owen Bradley]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=97}} He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} In April 1956, Decca released "[[Blue Days, Black Nights]]" as a single, with "Love Me" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for [[Faron Young]]. During the tour, they were promoted as Buddy Holly and the Two Tones, while later Decca called them Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} The label later released Holly's second single "Modern Don Juan", [[b-side|backed with]] "You Are My One Desire". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.{{sfn|Uslan|Solomon|1981|p=49}}

===The Crickets (1956–1957) ===
{{Main article|The Crickets}}
[[File:Buddy Holly & The Crickets publicity portrait - cropped.jpg|Buddy Holly and the Crickets in 1957 (top to bottom: Allison, Holly and Mauldin)|thumb]]
Holly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca, and inspired by the success of [[Buddy Knox]]'s "[[Party Doll]]" and [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s "[[I'm Stickin' with You]]", he visited [[Norman Petty]], who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist [[Joe B. Mauldin]], and rhythm guitarist [[Niki Sullivan]], he went to Petty's studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The group recorded a demo of "[[That'll Be the Day]]", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and [[Sonny Curtis]] had gone to see the film ''[[The Searchers]]'', starring [[John Wayne]], in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase "That'll be the day". This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians.<ref>Trzcinski, Matthew (February 10, 2022). [https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/john-wayne-movie-inspired-buddy-hollys-thatll-be-the-day.html/ "How a John Wayne Movie Inspired Buddy Holly's 'That'll Be the Day'"].

Petty became his manager and sent the record to [[Brunswick Records]] in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name "Crickets." Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release "That'll Be the Day", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EAGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT101 |title=Buddy Holly: A Biography |date=April 22, 2014 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=9781466868564 |page=101 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

Impressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. "I'm Looking for Someone to Love" was the B-side; the single was credited to [[The Crickets]]. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, [[Coral Records]]. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=131}}

Norman Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys would be reluctant to play and promote multiple new records by the same artist, but would have no problem playing these same records if they were credited to different performers. Holly himself was unaware of this strategy; in a 1957 radio interview with Dale Lowery, Holly said, "We have three records going out right now. Of course, the first one was 'That'll Be the Day', the first one released. Then we have a new one out by The Crickets, called 'Oh Boy!' and 'Not Fade Away', and then there's one out, it's the same group but it's under my name -- I don't know why they did it that way, but it went out under my name -- called 'Peggy Sue' and 'Everyday'."<ref>Buddy Holly interviewed by Dale Lowery for KTOP radio (Topeka, Kansas), 1957.</ref> Holly's records were released with labels reading "Buddy Holly" ''or'' "The Crickets"; the band was never credited on records as "Buddy Holly ''and'' the Crickets" until 1962, when a compilation album was released.

"That'll Be the Day" was released on July 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with [[Irvin Feld]], who had noticed the band after "That'll Be the Day" appeared on the R&B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York City.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=16}} The band was booked to play at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] on August 16–22. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included "[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]]." By the end of their run at the Apollo, "That'll Be the Day" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=17}} Holly appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended [[The Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=18}}
[[File:That'll Be the Day ad - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' advertisement, August 3, 1957]] 
"That'll Be the Day" topped the [[Number-one hits of 1957 (United States)|US "Best Sellers in Stores"]] chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=19}} Three days prior, Coral released "[[Peggy Sue]]", backed with "[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]", with Holly credited as the performer. By October, "Peggy Sue" had reached number three on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop chart and number two on the R&B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as "Buddy Holly and the Crickets"{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=57}} (although never on records during Holly's lifetime).

In the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark.{{sfn|Norman|p=127|1996}} After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his relationship with Clark a temporary one.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in [[Oklahoma City]], where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} The resulting album, ''[[The "Chirping" Crickets]]'', was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, "[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]", with "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" on the B-side. The single reached number 10 on the pop chart and 13 on the R&B chart.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=57}} Holly and the Crickets performed "That'll Be the Day" and "Peggy Sue" on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on December 1, 1957. Following the appearance, Niki Sullivan left the group because he was tired of the intensive touring, and wished to resume his education. On December 29, Holly and the Crickets performed "Peggy Sue" on ''[[The Arthur Murray Party]]''.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=127}}

===International tours and split (1958)===
On January 8, 1958, Holly and the Crickets joined ''America's Greatest Teenage Recording Stars'' tour.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=128}} On January 25, Holly recorded "[[Rave On]]"; the next day, he made his second appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', singing "Oh, Boy!"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=128}} Holly departed to perform in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, on January 27, and then started a week-long tour of Australia billed as the ''Big Show'' with [[Paul Anka]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Jodie Sands]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=189}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lo |first=Ping |date=October 29, 2008 |title=The night I saw Buddy Holly and the Crickets... for free |url=http://abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/10/29/2404761.htm |access-date=March 27, 2020 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> In March, the band toured the United Kingdom, playing 50 shows in 25 days.<ref name="Buddy Holly UK Tour">{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk/tour/buddy-holly-and-the-crickets-march-1958/|title=Buddy Holly & The Crickets – March 1958 « American Rock n Roll The UK Tours}}</ref> The same month, his debut solo album, ''[[Buddy Holly (album)|Buddy Holly]]'', was released. Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's ''Big Beat Show'' tour for 41 dates. In April, Decca released ''[[That'll Be the Day (album)|That'll Be the Day]]'', featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nashville sessions.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=90}}

A new recording session in Clovis was arranged in May; Holly hired [[Tommy Allsup]] to play lead guitar. The session produced the recordings of "[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]" and "[[Heartbeat (Buddy Holly song)|Heartbeat]]." Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&B band, recording "Now We're One" and [[Bobby Darin]]'s "[[Early in the Morning (Bobby Darin song)|Early in the Morning]]."{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=91}}

During a visit to the offices of [[Peermusic|Peer-Southern]], Holly met [[María Elena Santiago]]. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Norman Petty had tried to dissuade Holly from marriage; he felt that it would disappoint Holly's public and damage his career.

Holly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the [[Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]]. Holly also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=281}}

Santiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of its habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274}} She and her aunt Provi Garcia, an executive in the Latin American music department at Peer-Southern, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=280}} The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.{{sfn|Laing|p=153|2010}}

In September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded "Reminiscing" and "Come Back Baby." During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ [[Waylon Jennings]]. Holly produced the single "Jole Blon" and "When Sin Stops (Love Begins)" for Jennings.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=155}} Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Holly and Santiago settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in [[Greenwich Village]], where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including "[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]" and "What to Do."{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274–278}} The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire.{{sfn|Lloyd Webber|2015}}

On October 21, 1958, Holly's final studio session was recorded at the [[Pythian Temple (New York City)|Pythian Temple]] on West 70th Street (now a luxury condominium). Known by Holly fans as "the string sessions", Holly recorded four songs for Coral in an innovative collaboration with an 18-piece ensemble composed of former members of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] (including saxophonist [[Boomie Richman]]) under the direction of [[Dick Jacobs]].

The four songs recorded during the {{frac|3|1|2}}-hour session were: 
*"True Love Ways" (written by Buddy Holly), 
*"[[Moondreams (Norman Petty song)|Moondreams]]" (written by [[Norman Petty]]), 
*"[[Raining in My Heart]]" (written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant) and 
*"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]" (written by Paul Anka).{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=276–278}}
These four songs were the only ones Coral ever mixed in stereo, but only "Raining in My Heart" was released that way (in 1959, on an obscure promotional LP titled ''Hitsville''). All four records otherwise received releases in mono. The original stereo mixes were consulted many years later for compilation albums.

Holly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager and split from Holly. The split was amicable and based on logistics: Holly had decided to settle permanently in New York, where the business and publishing offices were, and the Crickets preferred not to leave their home state.

===Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959)===
{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}
[[File:GlassesSign.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost near the Clear Lake crash site]]

Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings's radio station in December 1958.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 51}} For the start of the [[Winter Dance Party]] tour, he assembled a band consisting of [[Waylon Jennings]] (electric bass), [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums).{{sfn|Corbin, Sky|2014}} Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959. Jennings stayed at Holly's apartment by [[Washington Square Park]] on the days prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the [[General Amusement Corporation|General Artists Corporation]], which organized the tour.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 58, 59}} They then traveled by train to Chicago to join the rest of the band.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 62}}

[[File:Surf Ballroom Monument.jpg|thumb|Monument in front of Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa]]
The Winter Dance Party tour began in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for [[frostbite]] to his toes (sustained while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} On February 2, before their appearance in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a four-seat [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] airplane for Jennings, Allsup, and himself, from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]]. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], via [[Fargo, North Dakota]], allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid an arduous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with [[Ritchie Valens]]. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, "That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life." Allsup later opened a restaurant/bar in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], called Heads Up Saloon.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Paul |date=June 24, 1988 |title=Hit parade |work=Chicago Tribune |id={{ProQuest|882608515}}}}</ref> Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to [[The Big Bopper|J.

The pilot, Roger Peterson, took off in inclement weather<!-- The meteorological conditions at the time of the aircraft's takeoff were not "a snowstorm" as previously stated here, but "Precipitation ceiling 3,000 feet (1,800 feet AGL), sky obscured; visibility 6 miles; scattered light snow; temperature {{convert|18|°F|°C|abbr=on}}; winds south 20 knots, gusts to 30 knots; altimeter setting 29.85 inches".

Buddy's brother Larry Holley said, "I got the full report from the Civil Aeronautics – it took me a year to get it, but I got it – and they had installed a new Sperry gyroscope in the airplane. The Sperry works different than any other gyro. One of them, the background moves and the plane stays like this [stationary], and in the other one the background stays steady and the plane moves, it works just backwards. He [the pilot] could have been reading this backwards... they were going down, they thought they were still climbing."

Shortly after 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on February 3, 1959, Holly, Valens, Richardson, and Peterson were killed when the aircraft crashed into a cornfield five miles northwest of Clear Lake shortly after takeoff. The three musicians, who were ejected from the fuselage upon impact, sustained severe head and chest injuries.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|1959}} Holly was 22 years old.

The report did not mention a gun belonging to Holly that was found by a farmer two months after the crash. Newspaper accounts of the gun discovery fueled rumors among fans that the pilot was somehow shot, causing the crash. Another curious finding at the crash was that Richardson's body was discovered nearly {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=off}} away from the crash while the others were found in or near the wreckage. However, an autopsy done at the request of Richardson's son in 2007 found no evidence to support the rumors. Dr. Bill Bass, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, stated that "There was no indication of foul play," and that Richardson "died immediately."<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 7, 2007 |title=Big Bopper rumours put to rest by autopsy |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/big-bopper-rumours-put-to-rest-by-autopsy-1.683130 |publisher=The Associated Press |via=CBC}}</ref>

[[File:Buddy holley headstone.jpg|thumb|right|Holly's headstone in the City of Lubbock Cemetery]]
Holly's funeral was held on February 7, 1959, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Lubbock. The service was officiated by Ben D. Johnson, who had presided at the Hollys' wedding just months earlier. The pallbearers were Jerry Allison, Joe B. Mauldin, Niki Sullivan, Bob Montgomery, and [[Sonny Curtis]]. Some sources say that Phil Everly, one half of [[The Everly Brothers]], was also pallbearer, but Everly said that he attended the funeral but was not a pallbearer.{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|p=347|2014}} Waylon Jennings was unable to attend because of his commitment to the still-touring Winter Dance Party. Holly's body was interred in the City of Lubbock Cemetery, in the eastern part of the city. Holly's headstone carries the correct spelling of his surname (Holley) and a carving of his [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar.{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|p=348–52|2014}}

Santiago watched the first reports of Holly's death on television. The following day, she suffered a miscarriage. Holly's mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. Because of Elena's miscarriage, in the months following the accident, some government authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims' names until after families are informed.{{sfn|Suddath|2009}} Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later told the ''Avalanche-Journal'', "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane."{{sfn|Kerns|2008}}

== Personal life ==
Holly married [[María Elena Holly|María Elena Santiago]], a New York record company receptionist, on August 15, 1958, at [[Tabernacle Baptist Church (Fort Worth)|Tabernacle Baptist Church]] in his hometown of Lubbock, Texas. In 1959, Santiago was pregnant with their first child, but suffered a miscarriage immediately after Holly's death. They had only been married for six months.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Pisula |first1=Theresa |last2=Lovelace |first2=Tommy |date=June 1, 2000 |title=Interview with Maria Elena Holly |url=https://www.houstontheatre.com/buddy2.html |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=HoustonTheatre.com}}</ref>

Peggy Sue Gerron was the inspiration behind Holly's hit song "Peggy Sue". Holly and Gerron had a flirtatious relationship, and Gerron had known Holly since her schooldays when she was dating drummer Jerry Allison. Gerron married Allison on July 22, 1958. The two newlywed couples had a shared honeymoon in [[Acapulco]], Mexico.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=April 11, 2012 |title=My love for Buddy Holly and how his death stopped us marrying - by the |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/my-love-for-buddy-holly-and-how-his-death-stopped-us-marrying-by-the-real-peggy-sue-6648204.html |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=Evening Standard |language=en}}</ref>

Holly's own marriage to Santiago was distant and tense, and the couple were supposedly headed for divorce. In late 1958, Holly had also encouraged Gerron to divorce Allison over his drunkenly behaviour, but she declined. The act of divorce went against her [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] beliefs (however, Gerron eventually did divorce Allison in 1965). In December 1958, Holly recorded a demo of one of his last songs "Peggy Sue Got Married"—about Gerron and Allison's marriage.<ref name=":0" />

==Image and style==
Holly's singing style was characterized by his [[vocal hiccup]]s, a technique he acquired after hearing Elvis do it in 1955 on the Hayride show, and his alternation between his [[Modal voice|regular voice]] and [[falsetto]].{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2001}} Holly's "stuttering vocals" were complemented by his [[Percussive fingerstyle|percussive guitar playing]], solos, [[Double stop|stops]], [[bent note]]s, and rhythm and blues [[chord progression]]s.{{sfn|Henderson|Stacey|p=296|2014}} He often strummed [[Downpicking|downstrokes]] that were accompanied by Allison's percussion.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}}

Holly bought his first [[Fender Stratocaster]], which became his signature guitar, at Harrod Music in Lubbock. His innovative playing style was characterized by its blending of chunky rhythm and high string lead work. Holly played his first 1954 Stratocaster until it was stolen during a tour stop in [[Michigan]] in 1957. To replace it, he purchased a 1957 model before a show in Detroit. Holly owned four or five Stratocasters during his career.{{sfn|Hunter|p=87|2013}}

At the beginning of their music careers, Holly and his group wore business suits. When they met the Everly Brothers, Don Everly took the band to Phil's Men's Shop in New York City and introduced them to [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League clothes]]. The brothers advised Holly to replace his old-fashioned glasses with [[horn-rimmed glasses]], which had been popularized by [[Steve Allen]].{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=144}} Holly bought a pair of glasses made in Mexico from Lubbock optometrist Dr. J. Davis Armistead. Teenagers in the United States started to request this style of glasses, which were later popularly known as "Buddy Holly glasses."{{sfn|Jones|p=175|2014}}

While Holly's other belongings were recovered immediately following his fatal plane crash, there was no record of his signature glasses being found. They were presumed lost until, in March 1980, they were discovered in a Cerro Gordo County courthouse storage area by Sheriff Gerald Allen. They had been found in the spring of 1959, after the snow had melted, and had been given to the sheriff's office. They were placed in an envelope dated April 7, 1959, along with the Big Bopper's watch, a lighter, two pairs of dice and part of another watch, and misplaced when the county moved courthouses. The glasses frames were returned to Santiago a year later, after a legal contest over them with his parents. They are now on display at the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas.<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 12, 1980 |title=Holly's glasses returned to family |work=The Beaver County Times |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19800312&id=UfsqAAAAIBAJ&pg=4079,2430645 |access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=March 22, 1981 |title=Eyeglasses returned |work=The Prescott Courier |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&dat=19810322&id=oZ5OAAAAIBAJ&pg=6240,5970296 |access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:WinterDanceParty.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the ill-fated "Winter Dance Party" tour]]

Buddy Holly left behind dozens of unfinished recordings&nbsp;— solo transcriptions of his new compositions, informal jam sessions with bandmates, and tapes demonstrating songs intended for other artists. The last known recordings, made in Holly's apartment in late 1958, were his last six original songs. In June 1959, Coral Records overdubbed two of them with backing vocals by the [[Ray Charles Singers]] and studio musicians in an attempt to simulate the established Crickets sound. The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, "[[Peggy Sue Got Married (song)|Peggy Sue Got Married]]"/"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]." The new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly demos, using the same studio personnel, in January 1960.<ref>Goldrosen, John (1979). The Buddy Holly Story. Quick Fox. {{ISBN|978-0-825-63936-4}}</ref> All six songs were included in ''[[The Buddy Holly Story, Vol. 2]]'' (1960).

The demand for Holly records was so great (although none saw much chart success on the US billboards), and Holly had recorded so prolifically, that his record label was able to release new Holly albums and singles for the next 10 years. Norman Petty produced most of these new editions, drawing upon unreleased studio masters, alternate takes, audition tapes, and even amateur recordings (some dating back to 1954 with low-fidelity vocals). The final "new" Buddy Holly album, ''[[Giant (Buddy Holly album)|Giant]]'', was released in 1969; the single chosen from the album was "[[Love Is Strange]]."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Buddy Holly- Giant |year=1969 |url=https://www.discogs.com/Buddy-Holly-Giant/master/490135 |access-date=February 24, 2019 |publisher=discogs}}</ref>
 
''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' stated that Holly "produced some of the most distinctive and influential work in rock music."{{sfn|Crenshaw, Marshall|2015}} [[AllMusic]] defined him as "the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll."{{sfn|Eder, Bruce|2015}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him number 13 on its list of "100 Greatest Artists."{{sfn|Mellecamp|2011}} The ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' called him a "pioneer and a revolutionary [...] a multidimensional talent [...] (who) co-wrote and performed (songs that) remain as fresh and potent today."{{sfn|Norman, Phillip|2015}} In 2023, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked Holly at number 74 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=January 1, 2023 |title=The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-singers-all-time-1234642307/buddy-holly-8-1234642434/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 20, 2023}}</ref>

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included Holly among its first class in 1986. On its entry, the Hall of Fame remarked upon the large quantity of material he produced during his short musical career, and said it "made a major and lasting impact on popular music." It called him an "innovator" for writing his own material, his experimentation with [[double tracking]] and the use of [[orchestration]]; he is also said to have "pioneered and popularized the now-standard" use of two guitars, bass, and drums by rock bands.{{sfn|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame staff|2015}} [[The Songwriters Hall of Fame]] also inducted Holly in 1986, and said his contributions "changed the face of Rock 'n' Roll."{{sfn|Songwriters hall of Fame staff|2002}} Holly developed in collaboration with Petty techniques of [[overdubbing]] and [[reverb effect|reverb]], while he used innovative instrumentation later implemented by other artists.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}} Holly became "one of the most influential pioneers of rock and roll" who had a "lasting influence" on genre performers of the 1960s.{{sfn|Henderson|Stacey|p=296|2014}}

[[File:Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, TX IMG 0078.JPG|thumb|The [[Buddy Holly Center]], a museum in Lubbock, Texas]]
In 1980, [[Grant Speed]] sculpted a statue of Holly playing his Fender guitar. This statue is the centerpiece of Lubbock's Walk of Fame, which honors notable people who contributed to Lubbock's musical history. Other memorials to Buddy Holly include a street named in his honor and the [[Buddy Holly Center]], which contains a museum of Holly memorabilia and fine arts gallery. The center is located on Crickets Avenue, one street east of Buddy Holly Avenue, in a building that previously housed the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway Depot.{{sfn|Buddy Holly Center staff|2014}} In 2010, the statue was taken down for refurbishment, and construction of a new Walk of Fame began.

In 1997, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] gave Holly the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]].{{sfn|Hollywood Reporter Staff|1997}} He was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2000. On May 9, 2011, the City of Lubbock held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Buddy and Maria Elena Holly Plaza, the new home of the statue and the Walk of Fame.{{sfn|Kerns|2011}} On what would have been his 75th birthday, a star bearing Holly's name was placed on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].{{sfn|Duke, Alan|2011}}

===Influence===

==== The Beatles ====
[[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] saw Holly for the first time when he appeared on ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]''.{{sfn|Humphries|p=73|2003}} The two had recently met and begun their musical association. They studied Holly's records, learned his performance style and lyricism, and based their act around his persona. Inspired by Holly's insect-themed Crickets, they chose to name their band "[[the Beatles]]". Lennon and McCartney later cited Holly as one of their main influences.{{sfn|Riley|p=67–70|2011}}

Lennon's band [[the Quarrymen]] covered "That'll Be the Day" in their first recording session, in 1958.{{sfn|Gaar|p=238|2013}} During breaks in the Beatles' first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', on February 9, 1964, Lennon asked [[CBS]] coordinator Vince Calandra about Holly's performances; Calandra said Lennon and McCartney repeatedly expressed their appreciation of Holly.{{sfn|Harris|p=192–193|2014}} The Beatles recorded a close cover of Holly's version of "[[Words of Love]]", which was released on their 1964 album ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'' (in the US, in June 1965 on ''[[Beatles VI]]''). During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of "Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues" – which Holly popularized but did not write – with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2014|p=186}} Lennon recorded a cover version of "Peggy Sue" on his 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]''.{{sfn|Blaney, John|p=163|2005}} McCartney owns the [[Music publisher|publishing rights]] to Holly's song catalog.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2003}}

==== Bob Dylan ====
On January 31, 1959, two nights before Holly's death, 17-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] attended Holly's performance in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] for ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' in 1998: "...&nbsp;when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at [[Duluth National Guard Armory]] and I was three feet away from him&nbsp;... and he looked at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he was&nbsp;... with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way."{{sfn|Shelton|p=37|2011}}

==== The Rolling Stones ====
[[Mick Jagger]] saw Holly performing live in [[Woolwich]], London, during a tour of the UK; Jagger particularly remembered Holly's performance of "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" – a song that also inspired [[Keith Richards]], who modeled his early guitar playing on the track. The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964.{{sfn|Norman|p=12|2011}} Richards later said, "[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]&nbsp;...&nbsp;He's in everybody."{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|2014|p=274}}

==== Steve Marriott ====
From a young age, [[Steve Marriott]] was a huge fan of Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. Marriott wrote his first song, called "Shelia My Dear", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him 'Buddy'.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hewitt |first1=Paolo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4fwswEACAAJ |title=Steve Marriott: All Too Beautiful |last2=Hellier |first2=John |date=2004 |publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing |isbn=978-1-900924-44-3 |pages=44 |language=en}}</ref> Marriott also recorded a version of [[Kenny Lynch]]'s song "Give Her My Regards" b/w "Imaginary Love", the B-side written by Marriott, and released as a [[Single (music)|45-rpm]] in 1963 on Decca, inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/master/907139-Steve-Marriott-Give-Her-My-Regards "Steve Marriott - Give Her My Regards"].

==== Don McLean ====
[[Don McLean]]'s popular 1971 [[ballad (music)|ballad]] "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" was inspired by Holly's death and the day of the plane crash. The song's lyric, which calls the incident "The Day the Music Died", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'' is dedicated to Holly.{{sfn|Crouse, Richard|p=86|2012}} In 2015, McLean wrote, "Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments&nbsp;...&nbsp;By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself&nbsp;...&nbsp;in my view and the view of many others, a hit&nbsp;...&nbsp;Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed."{{sfn|McLean|2015}}

==== Eric Clapton ====
''The Chirping Crickets'' was the first album [[Eric Clapton]] ever bought; he later saw Holly on ''Sunday Night at the London Palladium''. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, "I thought I'd died and gone to heaven&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future – that's what I want{{'"}}.{{sfn|Clapton, Eric|p=19|2010}} In 1969, his supergroup [[Blind Faith]] released a cover version of Holly's "Well All Right" featuring [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gallucci |first=Michael |date=January 11, 2023 |title=Top 10 Jeff Beck Songs |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jeff-beck-songs/ |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref>

====Bobby Vee====
The launch of [[Bobby Vee]]'s successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash. Holly's profound influence on Vee's singing style can be heard in the songs "[[Rubber Ball]]" – the B-side of which was a cover of Holly's "Everyday" – and "Run to Him."{{sfn|Dean, Maury|2003|p=73}}

====The Hollies====
The name of the British rock band [[the Hollies]] is often claimed as a tribute to Holly; according to the band, they admired Holly, but their name was mainly inspired by sprigs of holly in evidence around Christmas 1962.{{sfn|Eder, Bruce|1996}}

====Phil Ochs====
In 1970, protest folk singer [[Phil Ochs]] released his sarcastic ''[[Greatest Hits (Phil Ochs album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1970) album, and eventually, his live album ''[[Gunfight at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1974). During his concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] on March 27, 1970, [[Phil Ochs]] performed his "Buddy Holly Medley" comprising Holly's songs "Not Fade Away", "I'm Gonna Love You Too", "Think It Over", "Oh, Boy!", "Everyday", and "It's So Easy".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Buddy Holly Medley (1970/Live At Carnegie Hall) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cxoSpcV0Vo |access-date=May 23, 2024 |website=YouTube| date=October 30, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Sanchez |first=Joshua |date=March 26, 2020 |title=Phil Ochs: the doomed folk singer who woke up from the American dream |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/phil-ochs-the-doomed-folk-singer-who-woke-up-from-the-american-dream |access-date=May 23, 2024 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Before performing the medley, Ochs announced to the audience, "We're going to do a medley of songs of one of the greatest musicians that ever lived, a man who died prematurely, a man who had a big influence on me&nbsp;...&nbsp;Before I became a protest and folk singer, I had memorized many other things before [[Pete Seeger]], before Bob Dylan, before [[the Weavers]], before anything you might have ever heard in New York City, and this is Buddy Holly."

====Elton John====
[[Elton John]] was musically influenced by Holly. At age 13, although he did not require them, John started wearing horn-rimmed glasses to imitate Holly.{{sfn|Goldrosen|1979|p=8}}

====Elvis Costello====
During the height of punk, [[Elvis Costello]] resembled Holly.

You couldn’t say that he didn’t remind you of Buddy Holly. The Buddy stereotype. At least on the surface. Elvis had Harold Lloyd in his DNA as well.

===Film and musical depictions===
====Film====
Holly's life story inspired a Hollywood biographical film, ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'' (1978); its lead actor [[Gary Busey]] received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of Holly. The film was widely criticized by the rock press, and by Holly's friends and family, for its inaccuracies.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Flippo |first=Chet |date=September 21, 1978 |title=The Truth Behind 'The Buddy Holly Story' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-buddy-holly-story-19780921 |url-status=dead |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117070007/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-buddy-holly-story-19780921 |archive-date=November 17, 2017 |access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref> This led Paul McCartney (whose MPL Communications by then controlled the publishing rights to Buddy Holly's song catalog) to produce and host his own documentary about Holly in 1985, titled ''The Real Buddy Holly Story''.

In 1987, musician [[Marshall Crenshaw]] portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', which depicts him performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the fatal airplane with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. Crenshaw's version of "Crying, Waiting, Hoping" is featured on the ''La Bamba'' original motion picture soundtrack.{{sfn|Green|p=267|1999}}

Holly's follow up to the hit song "Peggy Sue" is featured in the 1986 [[Francis Ford Coppola]] film ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which a 43-year-old mother and housewife facing divorce played by [[Kathleen Turner]] is thrust back in time and given the chance to change the course of her life.

[[Steve Buscemi]] appeared as Holly in a brief cameo as a 1950s-themed restaurant employee in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', in which he takes Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's orders (portrayed respectively by [[Uma Thurman]] and [[John Travolta]]).

In 1998, the post-apocalyptic film ''[[Six-String Samurai]]'' depicted Holly as a guitar-playing samurai traveling to Las Vegas to become the new king of Nevada after the death of Elvis Presley.

==== Television ====
Holly was depicted in a 1989 episode of the science-fiction television program ''[[Quantum Leap (1989 TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' titled "How the Tess Was Won"; Holly's identity is only revealed at the end of the episode. Dr. [[Sam Beckett]] ([[Scott Bakula]]) influences Buddy Holly to change his lyrics from "piggy, suey" to "Peggy Sue", setting up Holly's future hit song.{{sfn|Phillips|Garcia|1996|p=358}}

In the animated series ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', it is implied that the elderly villains Dragoon and Red Mantle are actually Richardson and Buddy Holly, who were recruited into the supervillain organization the Guild of Calamitous Intent on the night of their supposed deaths.

According to fellow musician [[Charlie Daniels]], "Carl Perkins' songs personified the rockabilly era, and Carl Perkins' sound personifies the rockabilly sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed."<ref name="naylor118">[[#legends|Naylor, p. 118.]]</ref> Perkins's songs were recorded by artists (and friends) as influential as [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Ricky Nelson]], and [[Eric Clapton]], which further established his prominent place in the history of popular music. [[Paul McCartney]] said "If there were no Carl Perkins, there would be no Beatles."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/rock-n-roll-legend-carl-perkins-much-anticipated-story-to-come-to-the-big-screen-32090.php | title = Rock 'n Roll Legend Carl Perkins' Much Anticipated Story to Come to the Big Screen | date = August 16, 2007 | access-date = April 5, 2013}}</ref>

Nicknamed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Rockabilly]]", Perkins was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]], the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]], and the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. He also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Award.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Carl Lee Perkins was born on April 9, 1932, in [[Tiptonville, Tennessee]], the son of poor [[sharecropper]]s Louise and Buck Perkins (misspelled on his birth certificate as "Perkings").<ref name="autogenerated2">[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/carlperkins/biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226181247/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/carlperkins/biography|date=February 26, 2010}}</ref> Beginning at the age of six, he worked long hours in the cotton fields with his family, whether school was in session or not. Siblings included brothers Jay and Clayton.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 8–9.]]</ref> The boys grew up hearing [[Southern gospel]] music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields.<ref name=pc8>{{Pop Chronicles|8|3}}</ref> On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', broadcast from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on his father's radio.

[[Roy Acuff]]'s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor.]]</ref> Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a [[cigar box guitar|cigar box]] and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out [[Gene Autry]] guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of [[blue note]].<ref name="naylor118" /><ref name=":0">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 13–14.]]</ref>

Perkins taught himself parts of Acuff's "[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|Great Speckled Bird]]" and "[[The Wabash Cannonball]]", having heard them played on the ''Opry''. He also has cited [[Bill Monroe]]'s fast playing and vocals as an early influence.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 11–12.]]</ref> Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to "Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate."<ref name="naylor118" /><ref name=":0" />

In January 1947, the Perkins family moved from [[Lake County, Tennessee]], to [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], 70 miles from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 55.]]</ref> At age fourteen Perkins wrote a country song called "Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg". [[Sam Phillips]] was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his [[Sun Records]] label.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 68.]]</ref>

===Beginnings as a performer===
Perkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern, near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of occasional fights, and both of the Perkins brothers gained a reputation as fighters.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 36–41.]]</ref>

During the next couple of years, as they became better known, the Perkins brothers began playing other taverns around Bemis and Jackson, including El Rancho, the Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop. Carl persuaded his brother Clayton to join them and play the [[upright bass]], to complete the sound of the band.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 48.]]</ref>

Perkins began performing regularly on [[WTJF (AM)|WTJS]] in Jackson during the late 1940s as a sometime member of the [[Tennessee Ramblers (Tennessee band)|Tennessee Ramblers]]. He appeared on the radio program ''Hayloft Frolic'', on which he performed two songs. Sometimes one was "Talking Blues", as done by Robert Lunn on the ''Grand Ole Opry''. Perkins and his brothers began appearing on ''The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour''. Positive listener response resulted in a 15-minute segment sponsored by Mother's Best Flour. By the end of the 1940s, the Perkins Brothers were the best-known band in the Jackson area.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 48–49.]]</ref> Perkins had day jobs during most of these early years, including picking cotton, working at various factories and plants, and as a pan greaser for the Colonial Baking Company.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 32, 70–71.]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |title=The Legend Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillytennessee.com |date=1998-01-19 |access-date=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117221958/http://www.rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |archive-date=November 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His brothers had similar pick-up jobs.

In January 1953, Perkins married Valda Crider, whom he had known for a number of years. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part-time, Valda, who had her own job, encouraged Perkins to begin working the taverns full-time. He began playing six nights a week. Later the same year he added [[W. S. Holland|W.S. "Fluke" Holland]] to the band as a drummer. Holland had no previous experience as a musician but had a good sense of rhythm.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 70–71.]]</ref>

[[Malcolm Yelvington]], who remembered the Perkins Brothers when they played in [[Covington, Tennessee]], in 1953, noted that Carl had an unusual blues-like style all his own.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 77.]]</ref> By 1955 Perkins had made tapes of his material with a borrowed tape recorder, and he sent them to companies such as Columbia and RCA. But he used addresses such as "Columbia Records, New York City" and seemed dismayed at the lack of response. "I had sent tapes to RCA and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and had never heard a thing from 'em."<ref name="Top Beats Bottom"/>

In July 1954, Perkins and his wife heard a new release of "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] on the radio.<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3318.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> As the song faded out, Perkins said, "There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing. I need to go see him."<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 79–90.]]</ref> According to another telling of the story, it was Valda who said that he should go to Memphis.<ref>''Rockabilly Legends''. Naler. p. 121.</ref> Later, Presley told Perkins he had traveled to Jackson and had seen Perkins and his group playing at El Rancho.<ref name="Top Beats Bottom">"The Top Beats the Bottom: Carl Perkins and his Music". ''The Atlantic''. December 1970. p. 100.</ref>

Years later, the musician [[Gene Vincent]] told an interviewer that, rather than Elvis's version of "Blue Moon of Kentucky" being a "new sound", "a lot of people were doing it before that, especially Carl Perkins."<ref>VanHecke, Susan (2000). ''Race with the Devil''. St. Martin's Press. p. 219. {{ISBN|0-312-26222-1}}.</ref>

=== Sun Records ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Carl perkins 1956.jpg|thumb|Perkins in 1956]] -->
Perkins successfully auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] in early October 1954. "[[Movie Magg]]" and "Turn Around" were released on the Phillips-owned Flip label (151) on March 19, 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/labels/f/f461.htm |title=Flip (Tenn.)

During the summer of 1955 they had junkets to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and [[Forrest City, Arkansas]], and to [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] and [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]. Again performing at El Rancho, the Perkins brothers were involved in an automobile accident in Woodside, Delaware. A friend who had been driving was pinned by the steering wheel and had to be dragged from the burning car by Perkins. Clayton had been thrown from the car but was not seriously injured.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 122–124.]]</ref>

It was a "bounce blues in flavorsome combined country and R&B idioms".<ref>''Billboard'', October 22, 1955.

Commenting on Perkins's playing, Sam Phillips has been quoted as saying

<blockquote>I knew that Carl could rock and in fact he told me right from the start that he had been playing that music before Elvis came out on record&nbsp;... I wanted to see whether this was someone who could revolutionize the country end of the business.<ref>[[Colin Escott|Escott, Colin]]; Hawkins, Martin. ''Good Rockin' Tonight: Sun Records and the Birth of Rock 'n' Roll''. Google eBook. Retrieved 10.11.2011.</ref></blockquote>

Also in the autumn of 1955, Perkins wrote "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]",<ref name=pc8/> inspired by seeing a dancer get angry with his date for scuffing up his shoes.<ref>Perkins, Carl; McGee, David (1996). ''Go, Cat, Go!'' Hyperion Press. p. 129. {{ISBN|0-7868-6073-1}}.</ref> Several weeks later, on December 19, 1955, Perkins and his band recorded the song during a session at Sun Studio in Memphis. Phillips suggested changes to the lyrics ("Go, cat, go"), and the band changed the end of the song to a "[[boogie-woogie|boogie]] [[vamp (music)|vamp]]".<ref name=miller>Miller, James (1999). ''Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947–1977''. Simon & Schuster. pp. 124–25. {{ISBN|0-684-80873-0}}.</ref>

After Sun records headliner Presley left for [[RCA Records|RCA]] in November 1955, Phillips told Perkins, "You're my rockabilly cat now."<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 135.]]</ref> "Blue Suede Shoes" was released on January 1, 1956, and became a massive chart success. In the United States, it reached number 1 on [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'' magazine's]] [[country music]] chart (the only number 1 success he would have) and number 2 on the ''Billboard'' Best Sellers popular music chart. On February 11 Presley performed it on CBS-TV's ''[[Stage Show]]''.  On March 17 Perkins became the first country artist to reach number 3 on the [[rhythm and blues]] charts.<ref name=miller/><ref name="naylor137">[[#legends|Naylor, p. 137.]]</ref> That night, he performed the song on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', and Presley reprised his performance on ''Stage Show''.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Perkins's song reached number 10 on the British charts. It was the first record by a Sun artist to sell a million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd

===Road crash===
After playing a show in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed to [[New York City]] for a March 24 appearance on [[NBC|NBC-TV's]] ''[[The Perry Como Show|Perry Como Show]]''. Shortly before sunrise on March 22, on Route 13 between [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] and [[Woodside, Delaware]], their vehicle hit the back of a pickup truck and went into a ditch containing about 12 inches of water. Holland had to pull Perkins, unconscious, from the water. Perkins had sustained three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body. Perkins remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup truck, Thomas Phillips, a 40-year-old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 178, 180.]]</ref> Jay Perkins had a fractured neck and severe internal injuries.

On March 23, Presley's band members [[Bill Black]], [[Scotty Moore]] and [[D.J. Fontana]] visited Perkins on their way to New York to appear with Presley. Fontana recalled Perkins saying, "You looked like a bunch of angels coming to see me."<ref>Burke, Ken; Griffin, Dan (2006). ''The Blue Moon Boys: The Story of Elvis Presley's Band''. Chicago Review Press. p. 88. {{ISBN|1-55652-614-8}}.</ref> Black told him, "Hey man, Elvis sends his love", and lit a cigarette for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an [[oxygen tent]].<ref name=":1" /> Presley also telegraphed Perkins his well wishes.<ref name=":1">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 182, 184.]]</ref>

"Blue Suede Shoes" had sold more than 500,000 copies by March 22, and Sam Philips had planned to celebrate by presenting Perkins with a [[Gold Record|gold record]] on ''The Perry Como Show''.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 173.]]</ref> While Perkins recuperated from his injuries, "Blue Suede Shoes" reached number 1 on regional pop, R&B, and country charts.

By mid-April, more than one million copies of "Blue Suede Shoes" had been sold.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 187.]]</ref> On April 3, while still recuperating in Jackson, Perkins watched Presley perform "Blue Suede Shoes" in his first appearance on ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''.

Perkins returned to live performances on April 21, 1956, beginning with an appearance in [[Beaumont, Texas]], with the "Big D Jamboree" tour.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 191.]]</ref> Before he resumed touring, Sam Phillips arranged a recording session at Sun, with Ed Cisco filling in for the still-recuperating Jay. By mid-April, "[[Dixie Fried]]", "Put Your Cat Clothes On", "Wrong Yo-Yo", "You Can't Make Love to Somebody", "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]", and "That Don't Move Me" had been recorded.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 198.]]</ref> On May 26, Perkins and his band (with Jay Perkins performing wearing a visible neck brace), finally appeared on ''The Perry Como Show'' to perform "Blue Suede Shoes".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNyvO4QouY Youtube: "Carl Perkins - Blue Suede Shoes - Perry Como Show -1956"]</ref>

[[File:Jamboree Carl Perkins.jpg|thumb|250 px|Perkins (front) performing "[[Glad All Over (Carl Perkins song)|Glad All Over]]" with (left to right) Clayton Perkins, W.S. "Fluke" Holland, and Jay Perkins in the 1957 movie ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]'']]

Beginning early that summer, Perkins was paid $1,000 to play two songs a night on the extended tour of "Top Stars of '56". Other performers on the tour were [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers]]. When Perkins and the group entered the stage in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], he was shocked to see a teenager with a bleeding chin pressed against the stage by the massed crowd. During the first guitar intermission of "Honey Don't", they were waved offstage and into a vacant dressing room behind a double line of police officers. Appalled by what he had seen and felt, Perkins left the tour.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 188, 210, 212.]]</ref> Appearing with [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Lillian Briggs]] in a "rock 'n' roll show", he helped attract 39,872 people to the Reading Fair in Pennsylvania on a Tuesday night in late September. Soon after, a full grandstand and one thousand people stood in a heavy rain to hear Perkins and Briggs at the Brockton Fair in Massachusetts.<ref>''Billboard'', September 29, 1956. pages 73, 78.</ref>

Sun issued more Perkins songs in 1956: "[[Boppin' the Blues]]"/"All Mama's Children" (Sun 243), the B side co-written with Johnny Cash; and "[[Dixie Fried]]"/"I'm Sorry, I'm Not Sorry" (Sun 249). "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]"/"[[Your True Love]]" (Sun 261)<ref>[http://rcs.law.emory.edu/rcs/pics/d03/3238.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205180927/http://rcs.law.emory.edu/rcs/pics/d03/3238.htm|date=February 5, 2009}}</ref> came out in February 1957.<ref name="rcs-discography1"/> "[[Boppin' the Blues]]" reached number 47 on the ''Cashbox'' pop singles chart, number 9 on the ''Billboard'' country and western chart, and number 70 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100 chart.

"Matchbox" is considered a rockabilly classic. It was recorded with Perkins on lead guitar and vocals, and then Sun studio piano player [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].  Later that day there was an impromptu session with Perkins, Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, informally referred to as the [[Million Dollar Quartet]].<ref name=pc8/> The full recordings from this jam session, a selection of gospel, country, and R&B songs, were released in 1990.<ref name="nytimesobit"/>

On February 2, 1957, Perkins again appeared on ''Ozark Jubilee'', singing "Matchbox" and "Blue Suede Shoes". He also made at least two appearances on ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' in [[Compton, California]], in 1957,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/programs/story/index.php?prog=170 |title=Town Hall Party |publisher=hillbilly-music.com |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> singing both songs. Those performances were included in the ''Western Ranch Dance Party'' series filmed and distributed by Screen Gems.

He released "[[That's Right (Carl Perkins song)|That's Right]]", co-written with Johnny Cash, backed with the ballad "Forever Yours", as Sun single 274 in August 1957. Neither side made it onto the charts.

The 1957 film ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]'' included a Perkins performance of "[[Glad All Over (Carl Perkins song)|Glad All Over]]". The song, written by [[Aaron Schroeder]], [[Sid Tepper]], and [[Roy C. Bennett]],<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3240.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> was released by Sun in January 1958.<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/p/perk1000.htm#l2w] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120717234900/http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/p/perk1000.htm|date=July 17, 2012}}</ref>

===Life after Sun===
In 1958, Perkins moved to [[Columbia Records]], for which he recorded "Jive After Five", "Rockin' Record Hop", "Levi Jacket (And a Long Tail Shirt)", "Pop, Let Me Have the Car", "Pink Pedal Pushers", "Any Way the Wind Blows", "Hambone", "Pointed Toe Shoes", "Sister Twister", "L-O-V-E-V-I-L-L-E" and other songs.<ref name="rcs-discography1"/>

In 1959, he wrote the [[country & western]] song "[[The Ballad of Boot Hill]]" for Johnny Cash, who recorded it on an [[extended play|EP]] for Columbia Records. In the same year, Perkins was cast in a Filipino movie produced by People's Pictures, ''Hawaiian Boy'', in which he sang "Blue Suede Shoes".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

He performed often at the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget Casino]] in Las Vegas in 1962 and 1963.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} During this time he toured nine Midwestern states and made a tour in Germany.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 1962 [[Patsy Cline]] recorded "[[So Wrong]]" written by Carl, [[Mel Tillis]] and [[Danny Dill]] and had a #14 hit on the Country charts.

In May 1964, Perkins toured [[UK|Britain]] with [[Chuck Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.de/tour1964.htm#Chuck%20Berry |title=Tour Information 1964 |publisher=Chuckberry.de |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> Perkins had been reluctant to undertake the tour, convinced that as forgotten as he had become in America, he would be even more obscure in the U.K., and did not want to be humiliated by drawing meager audiences. Berry assured him that they had remained much more popular in Britain since the 1950s than they had in the United States, and that there would be large crowds of fans at every show. The popular young rock group [[The Animals]] backed the two performers. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party where he sat on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]. Ringo Starr asked if he could record "Honey Don't". Perkins answered, "Man, go ahead, have at it."<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 142.]]</ref> The Beatles later recorded covers of "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]", "[[Honey Don't]]" and "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]" (recorded by Perkins, adapted from a song originally recorded by [[Rex Griffin]] in 1936, with new music by Perkins; a song with the same title was recorded by Roy Newman in 1938). Ringo sang the lead on the first two, [[George Harrison]] received a rare lead on the third. The Beatles also recorded two versions of "Glad All Over" in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Beatles "Glad All Over" |url=http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/the_beatles/glad_all_over.html |title=The Beatles Lyrics - Glad All Over |publisher=Oldielyrics.com |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref> Another tour to Germany followed in the autumn.

He released "Big Bad Blues" backed with "Lonely Heart" as a single on Brunswick Records with [[the Nashville Teens]] in June 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/05909 |title=Carl Perkins - Big Bad Blues / Lonely Heart - Brunswick - UK - 05909 |publisher=45cat |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

In 1966, Perkins signed with Dollie Records and released as his first single "Country Boy's Dream", which reached #22 in the country charts. That same year [[Bob Luman]] had a Top 40 Country hit with Carl's song "Poor Boy Blues".

While on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins went on a four-day drinking binge that ended in him hallucinating floridly and passing out. When he regained consciousness, he went out to the beach with his last bottle of alcohol. In his autobiography, he described falling to his knees and declaring, "Lord,&nbsp;... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you," before hurling the bottle into the sea and vowing to remain sober. Perkins and Cash, who had his own substance-abuse issues, supported each other in their bid to remain sober.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 309–310.]]</ref>

In 1968, Cash recorded the Perkins-written "[[Daddy Sang Bass]]" (which incorporates parts of the American standard "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (Bye and Bye)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]"), and scored No. 1 on the country music charts for six weeks. "Daddy Sang Bass" was a [[Country Music Association]] nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins also played lead guitar on Cash's single "[[A Boy Named Sue]]", recorded live at [[San Quentin]] prison, which went to No. 1 for five weeks on the country chart and No. 2 on the pop chart (the performance was also filmed by [[Granada Television]] for broadcast).

Perkins spent a decade in Cash's touring revue, often as an opening act for Cash (as at the Folsom and San Quentin prison concerts, at which he was recorded singing "Blue Suede Shoes" and "Matchbox" before Cash took the stage; these performances were not released until the 2000s). He also appeared on the television series ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''. On the television program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' on April 16, 1969, hosted by Cash, Perkins performed his song "[[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|Restless]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |title=Restless - Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillyeurope.com |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929222820/http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/kraft-music-hall/johnny-cash...on-the-road/episode/170681/summary.html |title=Kraft Music Hall: Johnny Cash&nbsp;...

Perkins and [[Bob Dylan]] wrote "Champaign, Illinois" in 1969. Dylan had recorded his album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'', a bold crossover into country, in Nashville from February 12 to February 21. He met Perkins when he appeared on ''The Johnny Cash Show'' on June 7.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/the-johnny-cash-show/show/8950/episode.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabssh&tag=tabs;episodes |title=The Johnny Cash Show Season 2 Episode Guide |publisher=TV.com |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601094808/http://www.tv.com/the-johnny-cash-show/show/8950/episode.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabssh&tag=tabs;episodes |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dylan had [[writer's block]] and was unable to complete the song until Perkins contributed a rhythm and some lyrics, upon which Dylan said to him, "Your song. Take it. Finish it."<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins.]]</ref> Perkins registered the song as co-authored and recorded it on his 1969 album ''On Top''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.rockabillyhall.com/CarlPerkins.html | title=RAB Hall of Fame: Carl Perkins | access-date= 2007-01-18 | publisher= Rockabilly Hall of Fame}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://music.aol.com/album/on-top/12282 | archive-url= https://archive.today/20120717200303/http://music.aol.com/album/on-top/12282 | url-status= dead | archive-date= 2012-07-17 | title= On Top: Carl Perkins | access-date= 2007-01-18 | publisher= AOL Music }}</ref>

Also in 1969, Columbia's Murray Krugman placed Perkins with the [[New Rhythm and Blues Quartet]], a rockabilly group based in New York's Hudson Valley. Perkins and NRBQ recorded ''Boppin' the Blues'', which featured the group backing him on songs including his staples "Turn Around" and "Boppin' the Blues", as well as songs recorded separately by Perkins and NRBQ.<ref>''Boppin' the Blues''. Columbia CS9981 (1969).</ref> Perkins appeared with Cash on TV on the popular country series ''[[Hee Haw]]'', on February 16, 1974.

[[Tommy Cash]] (brother of Johnny Cash) had a Top Ten country gospel hit in 1970, with a recording of the song "Rise and Shine", written by Perkins. It reached number 9 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 8 on the Canadian country chart. [[Arlene Harden]] had a Top 40 country hit in 1971 with the Perkins composition "True Love Is Greater Than Friendship", from the film ''[[Little Fauss and Big Halsy]]'' (1971). [[Al Martino]]'s cover of the song that same year reached number 22 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 33 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart.

After a long legal struggle with Sam Phillips over [[royalties]], Perkins gained ownership of his songs in the 1970s and, in 2003, his widow and then owner of the catalog entered into an administration contract with Paul McCartney's [[MPL Communications]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |author=Mike Kovacich |url=http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |title=MACCA-News: McCartney to Administer Perkins's Music |publisher=Macca-central.com |date=April 17, 2003 |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213055837/http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Later years===
The rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1981 Perkins recorded the song "Get It" with [[Paul McCartney]], providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle; according to one source, he fully co-wrote the song with McCartney.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 145.]]</ref> This recording was included on the chart-topping album ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'', released in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pctc259.html |title=Tug Of War |publisher=Jpgr.co.uk |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref>  During 1985, Perkins re-recorded "Blue Suede Shoes" with [[Lee Rocker]] and [[Slim Jim Phantom]] of the [[Stray Cats]], as part of the soundtrack for the film ''[[Porky's Revenge]]''.

In October 1985, Perkins was joined on stage in [[London]] for a television special, ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]'', by [[George Harrison]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Edmunds]], Lee Rocker, [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The show was taped live at the [[Limehouse Studios]]. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on January 1, 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs, with two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing "Blue Suede Shoes", his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a highlight of his later career. It has been praised by fans for the spirited performances delivered by Perkins and his guests. The concert was released for DVD by Snapper Music in 2006.<ref>DVD ''Carl Perkins & Friends''. Released by Graham Nolder/Snapper Music. 2006. Cat:SDVD514</ref>

Perkins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1985. Wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. "Blue Suede Shoes" was chosen as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|“500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll”]]. The song also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]]. Perkins was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his pioneering contribution to the genre.

Perkins's only notable film performance as an actor was in [[John Landis]]'s 1985 film ''[[Into the Night (1985 film)|Into the Night]]''. The cameo-laden film includes a scene in which characters played by Perkins and [[David Bowie]] die by each other's hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089346/fullcredits#cast|title=Into the Night (1985): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

Perkins returned to the Sun Studio in Memphis in 1986, joining Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and [[Roy Orbison]] on the album ''[[Class of '55]]''. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet [[jam session]] involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis in 1956.

In 1989, Perkins co-wrote and played guitar on [[the Judds]]' number 1 country hit, "Let Me Tell You About Love". Also in that year, he signed a record deal with Platinum Records for the album ''Friends, Family, and Legends'', featuring performances by [[Chet Atkins]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Steve Wariner]], [[Joan Jett]] and [[Charlie Daniels]], along with [[Paul Shaffer]] and Will Lee. The song "Wild Texas Wind" became the title track to a made-for-TV [[Wild Texas Wind|movie]] featuring [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Gary Busey]]. In 1996 [[Willie Nelson]], who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duett version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. 
Dolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with the Perkins co-written [[Silver and Gold (Dolly Parton song)|"Silver and Gold"]].

[[Mark O'Connor]] recorded a version of the Perkins classic [[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|"Restless"]] in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US (#19 in Canada).

He again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player, for the album ''706 ReUNION'', released by Belle Meade Records, which also featured [[D. J. Fontana]], Marcus Van Storey and [[the Jordanaires]]. In 1993, Perkins performed with the [[Kentucky Headhunters]] in a music video remake of his song "Dixie Fried", filmed in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]]. In 1994, he teamed up with [[Duane Eddy]] and [[the Mavericks]] to contribute "Matchbox" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

His last album, ''[[Go Cat Go!]]'', released by the independent label Dinosaur Records in 1996, features Perkins singing duets with [[Bono]], Johnny Cash, [[John Fogerty]], George Harrison, Paul McCartney, [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/go_cat_go.html |title=Carl Perkins/Various Artists: Go Cat Go! |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Carl Perkins|chart=all}} ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

His last major concert performance was the [[Music for Montserrat]] all-star charity concert at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on September 15, 1997, four months before his death.

==Personal life==
A strong advocate for the prevention of child abuse, Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center for the prevention of child abuse in Tennessee and the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert planned by Perkins were combined with a grant from the [[National Exchange Club]] to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center's annual operating budget.<ref>Tennessee Historical Commission</ref>

Perkins had one daughter, Debbie, and three sons, Stan, Greg, and Steve.  Stan, Perkins' firstborn son, is also a recording artist. In 2010, he joined forces with [[Jerry Naylor]] to record a duet tribute, "To Carl: Let It Vibrate". Stan has been inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].  Greg played bass on stage alongside his father at the 1985 ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]'' concert in London and co-wrote "Birth of Rock and Roll" with his father.<ref name="GregPerkinsObituary">{{cite web |title=Greg Jaye Perkins: Greg Perkins Obituary |url=https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/jacksonsun/name/greg-perkins-obituary?id=48587406 |website=Legacy.com |publisher=The Jackson Sun |access-date=June 17, 2024 |date=November 20, 2005}}</ref>  (In 1983, a jury in Jackson, Tennessee found Greg Perkins "innocent on two felony counts of vehicular homicide, and guilty on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol."<ref name="GregPerkinsDUI">{{cite web |last1=Hopkins |first1=Gwen |title=Perkins cleared of death charge |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-jackson-sun-gregory-perkins-cleared/14086294/ |website=Newspapers.com |publisher=The Jackson Sun |access-date=June 17, 2024 |location=Jackson, Tennessee |pages=1 |date=December 23, 1983}}</ref>  In 1997, Perkins' wife Valda was "recovering from a yearlong illness,"<ref name="GregPerkinsIllness">{{cite web |last1=Galipault |first1=Gerry |title=Carl Perkins faces another challenge |url=https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1997/04/04/carl-perkins-faces-another-challenge/ |website=Tampa Bay Times |access-date=June 17, 2024 |orig-date=April 4, 1997 |date=October 1, 2005}}</ref> and his son Greg collapsed as a result of liver damage that may have resulted in a liver transplant.<ref name="GregPerkinsIllness"></ref>

Perkins' widow, Valda deVere Perkins, died on November 15, 2005, in Jackson.  Carl and Valda Perkins' son Greg (born January 15, 1959) died three days later at age 46 on November 18, 2005.<ref name="GregPerkinsObituary"></ref>
<!-- Singer-guitarist [[Luther Perkins]], who was also a member of Cash's touring show, was not related to Perkins. -->

==Guitar style==
As a guitarist Perkins used finger picking, imitations of the pedal steel guitar, [[palm mute|palm muting]], [[arpeggios]], advantageous use of open strings, single and double [[string bending]], [[chromaticism]], country and blues licks, and [[tritone]] and other tonality clashing licks (short phrases that include notes from other keys and move in logical, often symmetric patterns).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paul-clark.com/pages/tutorial/Pentatonics.pdf |title=Pentatonics |publisher=Paul-clark.com |access-date=2015-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116091707/http://www.paul-clark.com/pages/tutorial/Pentatonics.pdf |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A rich vocabulary of chords including sixth and thirteenth chords, ninth and add nine chords, and suspensions, show up in rhythm parts and solos. Free use of syncopations, chord anticipations (arriving at a chord change before the other players, often by an eighth-note) and [[crosspicking]] (repeating a three eighth-note pattern so that an accent falls variously on the upbeat or downbeat) were also in his bag of tricks.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 78.]]</ref>

'''Charles Arthur Feathers''' (June 12, 1932 – August 29, 1998)<ref name="AMG"/> was an American musician most associated with the [[rockabilly]] scene of the 1950s. Although not initially recognized for his contributions to rockabilly, over time his presence would become greatly elevated and he has been cited as an influence by a number of musicians.

==Biography==
Feathers was born in [[Holly Springs, Mississippi]], United States.<ref name= "Presley">{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Myrna |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-09-mn-21031-story.html |title=Charlie Feathers; Co-Wrote Pivotal Song for Presley |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 9, 1998 |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

He started out as a session musician at [[Sun Studios]], playing any side instrument he could in the hopes of someday making his own music there.<ref name= "Iobit">{{cite news |last=Leigh |first=Spencer |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-charlie-feathers-1196913.html |title=Obituary: Charlie Feathers |work=[[The Independent]] |date=September 9, 1998 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>  He eventually played on a small label started by [[Sam Phillips]] called Flip records which got him enough attention to record a couple of singles for [[Sun Records]] and [[Holiday Inn Records]]. By all accounts the singer was not held in much regard by Phillips, but Feathers often made the audacious claim that he had arranged "[[That's All Right]]" and "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" for [[Elvis Presley]]. He also claimed that his "We're Getting Closer (To Being Apart)" had been intended to be Elvis' sixth single for Sun. He did, however, get his name on one of Elvis' Sun records, "[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget (song)|I Forgot To Remember To Forget]]" when the writer Stan Kesler asked him to record a demo of the song.<ref name="AMG">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4241/biography|pure_url=yes}} Charlie Feathers biography] at [[AllMusic]]</ref><ref name=bc>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabilly.nl/artists/feathers.htm|title= Black Cat Rockabilly Biography of Charlie Feathers|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref>

He then moved on to [[Meteor Records]] and then [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] where he recorded his best-known work.  His 1950s singles included "Peepin' Eyes", "Defrost Your Heart", "Tongue-Tied Jill" and "Bottle to the Baby". When his King contract ran out he still continued to perform, although Feathers thought there was a conspiracy to keep his music from gaining the popularity it deserved.<ref name=bc/>

In the mid-1980s, he performed at times at new music nightclubs like the Antenna Club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], sharing the bill with [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] bands like [[Tav Falco's Panther Burns]], who, as devoted fans of Feathers, had introduced him to their label's president.<ref name= "Panther">{{cite news |last=Sprague |first=David |url= https://variety.com/2001/music/reviews/panther-burns-1200467792/ |title=Panther Burns |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 17, 2001 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

He released his ''New Jungle Fever'' album in 1987 and ''Honkey Tonk Man'' in 1988, featuring the lead guitar work of his son, Bubba Feathers. These later albums of original songs penned by Feathers were released on the [[France|French]] label New Rose Records, whose other 1980s releases included albums by [[Johnny Thunders]], [[Alex Chilton]], [[Roky Erickson]], [[The Cramps]], [[The Gun Club]], and others.

He died on August 29, 1998, of complications from a [[stroke]]-induced coma.<ref name= "Presley" /><ref name= "Iobit" /> He was buried at [[Forest Hill Cemetery South (Memphis, Tennessee)|Forest Hill Cemetery South]] in Memphis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Amos|first=Edward|year=2015|title=Gravesites of Southern Musicians|url={{Google books|bTOSCgAAQBAJ|page=59|plainurl=yes}}|page=59|access-date=2022-10-05}}</ref>

== Style and influences ==

Charlie Feathers studied and recorded several songs with [[Junior Kimbrough]], whom he called "the beginning and end of all music".<ref>Liner notes by Anthony DeCurtis in *You Better Run: The Essential Junior Kimbrough*, released by Fat Possum Records, 2002</ref> His childhood influences were reflected in his later music of the 1970s and 1980s, which had an easy-paced, sometimes sinister, [[country blues|country-blues]] tempo, as opposed to the frenetic fast-paced style favored by some of his rockabilly colleagues of the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Feathers was known for being a master of shifting emotional and sonic dynamics in his songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} His theatrical, hiccup-styled, energetic, rockabilly vocal style inspired a later generation of rock vocalists, including [[Lux Interior]] of [[The Cramps]].<ref name= "Lux">{{cite news |last=Whiteside |first=Jonny |url= https://www.laweekly.com/music/lux-interior-a-remembrance-from-jonny-whiteside-2404319 |title=Lux Interior: A Remembrance from Jonny Whiteside |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

Feathers' song, "That Certain Female" was featured on the soundtrack to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2003 film, ''[[Kill Bill:<!-- The official website shows a colon in the title.  See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --> Volume 1]]''. His "Can't Hardly Stand It" was featured on the follow-up ''[[Kill Bill:<!-- The official website shows a colon in the title.  See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-2/ --> Volume 2]]'' soundtrack, as well as the highly successful video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''. A brief bit of "Can't Hardly Stand It" was also featured in the 2013 film ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]''.
  
Charlie Feathers' pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. [[Bob Dylan]] has featured Charlie Feathers on the second season of his [[XM satellite radio]] show [[Theme Time Radio Hour]], playing Feathers' records "One Hand Loose" (on the "Countdown" show, Dec. 12, 2007) and "Defrost Your Heart" (on the "Cold" show, April 2, 2008). His song "Can't Hardly Stand It" is featured in the video game [[Grand Theft Auto V]] on the game's radio station, Rebel Radio. Feathers is an inductee in the [[Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msmusic.org/mississippi-country-musicians.html|title=Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame - Country|website=Msmusic.org|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}</ref>

'''Charles Allan Rich''' (December 14, 1932{{spaced ndash}}July 25, 1995) was an American [[Country music|country]] singer. His eclectic style of music also blended influences from [[rockabilly]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[gospel music|gospel]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Charlie Rich Biography, Songs, & Albums |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/charlie-rich-mn0000179730/biography |access-date=July 24, 2023 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

In the later part of his life, Rich acquired the nickname the '''Silver Fox'''. He is perhaps best remembered for a pair of 1973 hits, "[[Behind Closed Doors (Charlie Rich song)|Behind Closed Doors]]" and "[[The Most Beautiful Girl]]," which topped the U.S. country singles charts as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop singles charts and earned him two [[Grammy Award]]s. Rich was inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] in 2015. In 2023, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Rich at number 120 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=January 1, 2023|title=The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-singers-all-time-1234642307/charlie-rich-5-1234642998/|access-date=May 8, 2023|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Early life==
Rich was born in [[Colt, Arkansas|Colt]], Arkansas, to rural cotton farmers.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=Concise |pages=1010/1}}</ref> He graduated from Consolidated High School in [[Forrest City]], where he played saxophone in the band. He was strongly influenced by his parents, who were members of the Landmark Missionary Baptist Church; his mother, Helen Rich, played piano in church and his father sang in gospel quartets. A black sharecropper on the family land named C. J. Allen taught Rich blues piano. He enrolled at [[Arkansas State College]] on a football scholarship and then after an injury, transferred to the [[University of Arkansas]] as a music major. He left after one semester to join the [[United States Air Force]] in 1953.<ref name="Larkin"/>

He married Margaret Ann Greene in 1952. While stationed in [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], Oklahoma, he formed "the Velvetones", playing jazz and blues and featuring his wife on vocals.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> When he left the military in 1956, the couple returned to the West Memphis area to farm 500 acres. He also began performing in clubs around the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area, playing both jazz and [[R&B]], and began writing his own material.

==Career==
After recording some demonstration songs for [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] that Phillips considered "too jazzy" and insufficiently commercial, Rich was given a stack of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] records and told: "Come back when you get that bad."<ref name="Larkin"/> In a 1992 interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'' host [[Terry Gross]], Rich himself recalled [[Bill Justis]] telling Rich's wife those words.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=129612715 |title=Charlie Rich: The Silver Fox With A Big Country Sound |publisher=Npr.org |date=September 6, 2010 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>

In 1958, Rich became a regular [[session musician]] for Sun Records, playing on a variety of records by Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bill Justis]], [[Warren Smith (singer)|Warren Smith]], [[Billy Lee Riley]], [[Carl Mann]], and [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]].<ref name="Larkin"/> He also wrote several songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.<ref name="Larkin"/>

After he began recording for the Sun subsidiary [[Phillips International Records]], his third single was the 1960 Top 30 hit "Lonely Weekends",<ref name="Larkin"/> with [[Elvis Presley|Presley]]-like vocals. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/128 128]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/128}}</ref> None of his seven follow-up singles was a success, however, though several of the songs became staples in his live set, including "Who Will the Next Fool Be", "Sittin' and Thinkin'", and "No Headstone on My Grave".<ref name="Larkin"/> These songs were often recorded by others to varying degrees of success, such as the [[Bobby Bland]] version of "Who Will the Next Fool Be".

Rich's career then stalled and he left the struggling Sun label in 1963, signing with [[Groove Records|Groove]], a subsidiary of [[RCA Victor]].<ref name="Larkin"/> His first single for Groove, "Big Boss Man", was a minor hit, but once again, his [[Chet Atkins]]-produced follow-up records all failed. In 1965 he moved to [[Smash Records]], where his new producer, [[Jerry Kennedy]], encouraged him to emphasize his country and rock n' roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since childhood.<ref name="Larkin"/> His first single for Smash was "Mohair Sam", an R&B-inflected [[Novelty song|novelty]]-rock number written by [[Dallas Frazier]], which became a top 30 pop hit. It has been mentioned in thousands of articles as the song Elvis Presley   played on his jukebox during the Beatles' visit to his home on August 26, 1965. However, once more none of his follow-up singles were successful. Rich again changed labels, moving to [[Hi Records]], where he recorded [[blue-eyed soul]] music and straight country, but once more, none of his singles for Hi made a dent on the country or pop charts. One Hi Records track, "Love Is After Me" (1966), belatedly became a [[white soul]] favorite in the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

===Career peak in the 1970s===
Despite his lack of consistent commercial success, [[Epic Records]] signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer [[Billy Sherrill]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a [[Nashville Sound]] balladeer during an era when old rock 'n' roll artists like Jerry Lee Lewis and [[Conway Twitty]] were finding a new musical home in the Country format. This new "[[countrypolitan]]" Rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972, when "I Take It on Home" went to number six on the country charts.<ref name="Larkin"/> The title track from his 1973 album ''Behind Closed Doors'' became a number-one country hit early in that year, then crossed over into the top 20 on the pop charts.<ref name="Larkin"/> This time, his follow-up single did not disappoint, as "[[The Most Beautiful Girl]]" spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts.<ref name="Larkin"/> Now that he was established as a country music star, ''Behind Closed Doors'' won three awards from the [[Country Music Association]] that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year. The album was also certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. Rich won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, and he took home four [[Academy of Country Music]] awards. One of [[RCA Victor]]'s several resident songwriters, Marvin Walters, co-wrote for three years with Rich, producing four recordings including the popular "Set Me Free".{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

After "The Most Beautiful Girl," number-one hits came quickly, five songs topping the country charts in 1974 and crossed over to the pop charts:<ref name="Larkin"/> "There Won't Be Anymore" (pop number 18), "[[A Very Special Love Song]]" (pop number 11), "I Don't See Me In Your Eyes Anymore" (pop number 47), "I Love My Friend" (pop number 24), and "She Called Me Baby" (pop number 47). Both RCA Records and [[Mercury Records]] (Smash was a subsidiary of Mercury that was absorbed into the main company in 1970) also re-released his previously recorded material from the mid-1960s. All of this success led the CMA to name him Entertainer of the Year in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Singer Charlie Rich protests John Denver’s big win at the CMA Awards |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/singer-charlie-rich-protests-john-denvers-big-win-at-the-cma-awards |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=HISTORY |language=en}}</ref> In the same year he performed the Academy Award-nominated theme song "I Feel Love (Benji's Theme)" from the film ''[[Benji (1974 film)|Benji]]''. Rich had three more top-five hits in 1975, but though he was at the peak of his popularity, he began to drink heavily, causing considerable problems off-stage.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oliver |first=Myrna |date=1995-07-26 |title=Charlie Rich; Eclectic Country Singer |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-26-mn-27997-story.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Charlie Rich |url=https://elpee.jp/artist/Charlie%20Rich/ |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=elpee.jp |language=en}}</ref>

==== CMA awards 1975 ====
Rich's problematic drinking famously culminated at the CMA awards ceremony for 1975,<ref name="Larkin"/> when he presented the award for Entertainer of the Year while visibly intoxicated.<ref name="charlierichjr.com" /> After stumbling through the names of the nominees, he clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit fire to the paper with the winner's name.<ref name="Larkin"/> He then announced the winner of the award as "My friend Mr. [[John Denver]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Prachi Gupta |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/13/today_in_70s_nostalgia_watch_a_charlie_rich_burn_john_denver_at_the_1975_cmas/ |title=Today in '70s nostalgia: Watch Charlie Rich burn John Denver at the 1975 CMAs |work=Salon.com |date=June 13, 2014 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> Some considered it an act of rebellion against the [[Music Row]]-controlled Nashville Sound; others speculated that it was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too "pop" and not enough "country".<ref name="charlierichjr.com" /> Many, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich's popularity took a dive.<ref name="Larkin"/>  <!-- Removed this as conflicting with following sections; perhaps this was his only subsequent top 10 *pop* single?: recording just one more top ten single with "Since I Fell for You" -->

In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director [[Jo Walker-Meador]] speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website:<blockquote>I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis.&nbsp;... So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed.&nbsp;... Primarily he thought it would be funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver.<ref name="charlierichjr.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierichjr.com/controversy/the_envelope_burning/ |title=The Envelope Burning |publisher=Charlie Rich Jr. |access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

The slump in Rich's career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar: pop-inflected country ballads with [[overdub]]bed [[string instruments|strings]] and little jazz or blues. He did not have a top-10 hit again until "[[Rollin' With the Flow]]" went to number one on the country charts (as well as number 32 on the easy listening charts) in 1977.<ref name="Larkin"/> Early the following year, in 1978, he signed with [[United Artists Records]], and throughout that year, he had hits on both Epic and UA. His hits in 1978 included the top-10 hits "Beautiful Woman", "Puttin' In Overtime At Home", and his last number one with "[[On My Knees (1978 song)|On My Knees]]", a duet with [[Janie Fricke]].<ref name="Larkin"/>

===Decline in activity and semi-retirement===
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2022}}
In 1979, Rich had moderate success with his singles, his biggest hit being a version of "[[Spanish Eyes (1965 song)|Spanish Eyes]]" that entered the country top 20.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Greatest Country Hits of 1979 |url=http://www.severing.nu/music/c1979.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.severing.nu}}</ref> He appeared as himself in the 1978 [[Clint Eastwood]] movie ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way but Loose]]'', performing "I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home".<ref name="Larkin"/> This song hit number three on the country charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 country single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to [[Elektra Records]] and that fall released a number-12 country single, "A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through". One more top-40 hit followed, the [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] song "Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream" early in 1981. Also in 1981, he had a bit part in the movie ''[[Take This Job and Shove It (film)|Take This Job and Shove It]]'', which yielded his last charted single, "You Made It Beautiful". Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight, and for over a decade he lived off his investments in semi-retirement, only playing occasional concerts. 

In 1992, Rich emerged from his semi-retirement to release on [[Sire Records]] ''Pictures and Paintings'', a jazzy album produced by journalist [[Peter Guralnick]].<ref name="Larkin"/> It received positive critical reviews and restored Rich's reputation as a musician, but it was his last album. In 2016, a tribute album entitled ''Feel Like Going Home: The Songs of Charlie Rich'' was released by Memphis International Records.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-10-13 |title=Review: Charlie Rich tribute explores legend's Sun years |url=https://apnews.com/charlie-rich-tribute-music-abb293147541410494c0543a81c3ba08 |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref>  [[Tom Waits]], who was an opening act for Rich in the 1970s, mentions him in the song "Putnam County" from his album ''[[Nighthawks at the Diner]]'' with the lyric: "The radio's spitting out Charlie Rich... He sure can sing, that son of a bitch."

'''Chester Burton Atkins''' (June 20, 1924&nbsp;– June 30, 2001), also known as "'''Mister Guitar'''"  and "'''the Country Gentleman'''", was an American musician who, along with [[Owen Bradley]] and [[Bob Ferguson (musician)|Bob Ferguson]], helped create the [[Nashville sound]], the [[country music]] style which expanded its appeal to adult pop music fans. He was primarily a guitarist, but he also played the mandolin, fiddle, banjo, and ukulele, and occasionally sang.

Atkins's signature picking style was inspired by [[Merle Travis]]. Other major guitar influences were [[Django Reinhardt]], [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]], [[Les Paul]], and, later, [[Jerry Reed]].<ref name=pc10/> His distinctive picking style and musicianship brought him admirers inside and outside the country scene, both in the United States and abroad. Atkins spent most of his career at [[RCA Victor]] and produced records for the [[The Browns|Browns]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Dottie West]], [[Perry Como]], [[Floyd Cramer]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Everly Brothers]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Don Gibson]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Roger Whittaker]], [[Ann-Margret]] and many others.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited Atkins with inventing the "popwise 'Nashville sound' that rescued country music from a commercial slump" and ranked him number 21 on their list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="Chet Atkins">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/chet-atkins-20111122 "Chet Atkins"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827202538/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/chet-atkins-20111122 |date=August 27, 2017 }}.

He also received nine [[Country Music Association]] awards for Instrumentalist of the Year. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]], and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]]. [[George Harrison]] was also inspired by Chet Atkins; early Beatles songs such as "[[All My Loving]]" show the influence.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early life===
Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, in [[Luttrell, Tennessee]], near [[Clinch Mountain]]. His parents divorced when he was six years old, after which he was raised by his mother. He was the youngest of three boys and a girl. He started out on the [[ukulele]], later moving on to the [[fiddle]], but he made a swap with his brother Lowell when he was nine: an old pistol and some chores for a guitar.<ref name="CMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/atkins_chet/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040110022510/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/atkins_chet/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 10, 2004 |title=Country Music Television biography. |publisher=CMT |access-date=March 28, 2008}}</ref> He stated in his 1974 autobiography, "We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression." Forced to relocate to Fortson, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], outside of [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]] to live with his father because of a critical [[asthma]] condition, Atkins was a sensitive youth who became obsessed with music. Because of his illness, he was forced to sleep in a straight-back chair to breathe comfortably. On those nights, he played his guitar until he fell asleep holding it, a habit that lasted his whole life.<ref name="CG">Atkins, Chet; Neely, Bill (1974). "Country Gentleman."  Chicago. Harry Regnery. {{ISBN|0-8092-9051-0}}.</ref> While living in Fortson,  Atkins attended the historic{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Mountain Hill School. He returned in the 1990s to play a series of charity concerts to save the school from demolition.<ref>{{cite news

Stories have been told about the very young Chet who, when a friend or relative would come to visit and play guitar, crowded the musician and put his ear so close to the instrument that it became difficult for the visitor to play.<ref name="CG" />

Atkins became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school.<ref name="CMT" /> He used the restroom in the school to practice because it had good acoustics.<ref>Atkins, Chet; Neely, Bill (1974).

Later in life, he lightheartedly gave himself (along with [[John Knowles (guitarist)|John Knowles]], [[Tommy Emmanuel]], [[Steve Wariner]], and [[Jerry Reed]]<ref>{{YouTube|M8AXs6oRPnQ|'Interview of Chet Atkins'}}</ref>) the honorary degree CGP ("Certified Guitar Player").<ref name="mamg" />
In 2011, his daughter Merle Atkins Russell bestowed the CGP degree on his longtime sideman [[Paul Yandell]].  She then declared no more CGPs would be allowed by the Atkins estate.<ref>{{cite web

His half-brother Jim was a successful guitarist who worked with the [[Les Paul Trio]] in New York.<ref name="CG" />

Atkins did not have a strong style of his own until 1939 when (while still living in Georgia) he heard [[Merle Travis]] picking over [[WLW]] radio.<ref name="CG" /><ref>*[http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=99 Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014040342/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=99 |date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref> This early influence dramatically shaped his unique playing style.<ref name=pc10/> Whereas Travis used his index finger on his right hand for the melody and his thumb for the bass notes, Atkins expanded his right-hand style to include picking with his first three fingers, with the thumb on bass.  He also listened closely to the single-string playing of [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]] and [[Les Paul]].

Chet Atkins was an [[amateur radio]] general class licensee. Formerly using the call sign WA4CZD, he obtained the vanity call sign W4CGP in 1998 to include the CGP designation, which supposedly stood for "Certified Guitar Picker". He was a member of the [[American Radio Relay League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/pages/display/error404|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920143059/http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2001/07/02/1/?nc=1|url-status=dead|title=American Radio Relay League &#124; Ham Radio Association and Resources|archive-date=September 20, 2005|website=Arrl.org}}</ref>

===Early musical career===
After dropping out of high school in 1942, Atkins landed a job at [[WNML (AM)|WNOX (AM)]] (now WNML) radio in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], where he played fiddle and guitar with the singer [[Bill Carlisle]] and the comic [[Archie Campbell (comedian)|Archie Campbell]] and became a member of the station's Dixieland Swingsters, a small swing instrumental combo. After three years, he moved to [[WLW|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Merle Travis had formerly worked.

After six months, he moved to Raleigh and worked with [[Johnnie and Jack]] before heading for [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he performed with [[Sunshine Sue|Sunshine Sue Workman]]. Atkins's shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly "country". He was fired often but was soon able to land another job at another radio station on account of his unique playing ability.<ref name="CG" />

Atkins and [[Jethro Burns]] (of [[Homer and Jethro]]) married twin sisters Leona and Lois Johnson, who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson, the Johnson Sisters. Leona Atkins outlived her husband by eight years, dying in 2009 at the age of 85.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=3389 |title=Chet Atkins' Widow Dies |date=October 22, 2009 |work=Country Standard Time |access-date=October 29, 2011}}</ref>

Travelling to Chicago, Atkins auditioned for [[Red Foley]], who was leaving his star position on [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]]'s ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name="RollingStone">[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5931727/chet_atkins_dies/print "Chet Atkins Dies"]{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based [[Bullet Records]] that year. That single, "Guitar Blues", was fairly progressive, including a clarinet solo by the Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan and produced by [[Owen Bradley]]. He had a solo spot on the Opry, but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Despite the support of executive [[Si Siman]], however, he soon was fired for not sounding "country enough".<ref name="CG" />

===Signing with RCA Victor===
While working with a Western band in [[Denver, Colorado]], Atkins came to the attention of [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]]. Siman had been encouraging [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] to sign Atkins, as his style (with the success of Merle Travis as a hit recording artist) was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down in Denver.

He made his first RCA Victor recordings in Chicago in 1947, but they did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year, but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with Homer and Jethro on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show ''The Tennessee Barn Dance'' and the popular ''Midday Merry Go Round''.

In 1949, he left WNOX to join [[June Carter]] with Mother Maybelle and the [[The Carter Sisters|Carter Sisters]] on KWTO. This incarnation of the [[Carter Family]] featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen, and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the mid-1950s. Atkins began working on recording sessions and performing on [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]] and the Opry.<ref name="CG" /> Atkins became a member of the Opry in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web

While he had not yet had a hit record for RCA Victor, his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a session leader when the New York–based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA Victor artists. Atkins's first hit single was "[[Mr. Sandman]]", followed by "Silver Bell", which he recorded as a duet with [[Hank Snow]]. His albums also became more popular. He was featured on ABC-TV's ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]'' in the summer of 1956 and on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Country Music Jubilee]]'' in 1957 and 1958 (by then renamed ''Jubilee USA'').
[[File:Gretsch G6122-1958.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins's [[Gretsch]] Country Gentleman, model G6122, 1962]]

In addition to recording, Atkins was a design consultant for [[Gretsch]], which manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955 to 1980. He became manager of RCA Victor's Nashville studios, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary [[RCA Studio B]], the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous [[Music Row]]. Also later on, Chet and [[Owen Bradley]] would become instrumental in the creation of studio B's adjacent building [[RCA Studio A]] as well.<ref name="mamg" />

===Performer and producer===
When Sholes took over pop production in 1957—a result of his success with [[Elvis Presley]]—he put Atkins in charge of RCA Victor's Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll became more popular, Atkins took his cue from [[Owen Bradley]] and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar from many recordings, though not all, as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans, many of whom disliked the "twang" elements of country. This became known as the [[Nashville Sound]], which Atkins said was a label created by the media for a style of recording during that period intended to keep country (and their jobs) viable.

Atkins used the [[Jordanaires]] and a rhythm section on hits such as [[Jim Reeves]]'s "[[Four Walls (Jim Reeves song)|Four Walls]]" and "[[He'll Have to Go]]"<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r245817|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic entry for ''Welcome to My World'', Jim Reeves 1996 box set, Bear Family Records]</ref> and [[Don Gibson]]'s "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]" and "Blue Blue Day".<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1624|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography of Don Gibson]</ref> The once-rare phenomenon of having a country hit [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background. Other Nashville producers quickly copied this successful formula, which resulted in certain country hits "crossing over" to find success in the pop field.

Atkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and [[jazz]], in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA and adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him.<ref name="mamg" /> Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period, he became known internationally as "Mister Guitar", inspiring an album, ''[[Mister Guitar]]'', engineered by both Bob Ferris and [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], Ferris's replacement.

[[File:RCA Studio B - Chet Atkins, Bill Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins listening as [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]] adjusts a mix in RCA's Nashville studio]]
At the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at what was at the time RCA Victor's only Nashville studio, in the space that would become known as [[RCA Studio B|Studio B]] after the opening of a second studio in 1960. (At the time, RCA's sole Nashville studio had no letter designation.) Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studio's German effects device, an [[Elektro-Mess-Technik|EMT]] [[Reverberation#Plate reverberators|plate reverb]]. With his [[golden ear]], Porter found the studio's acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant [[room modes]]. The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more [[Dynamic range|dynamic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ballou|first=Glen|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|year=1998|publisher=Focal Press|page=1154}}</ref> In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him "it was Porter."<ref name=McClellan2004>{{cite book |last1=McClellan |first1=John |last2=Bratic |first2=Deyan |title=Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmCUExOXx0MC |volume=2 |year=2004 |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |isbn=978-0-7866-5877-0 |pages=149–152}}</ref> Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording—if someone was out of tune, he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, "we got a little tuning problem&nbsp;... Everybody check and see what's going on."<ref name=McClellan2004/> If that did not work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late-1964, Atkins said, "the sound was never the same, never as great."<ref name=McClellan2004/>

Atkins's trademark "Atkins style" of playing uses the thumb and first two or sometimes three fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis,<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/ |title=Show 10 – Tennessee Firebird: American Country Music Before and After Elvis. [Part 2] }}</ref> occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which was exactly how Travis played), and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers—and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.

He enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians, and they were asked to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960. That performance was cancelled because of rioting, but a live recording of the group (''[[After the Riot in Newport|After the Riot at Newport]]'') was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the [[White House]] for every U.S. president from [[John F. Kennedy]] through to [[George H. W. Bush]]. Atkins was a member of the [[Million Dollar Band (country music group)|Million Dollar Band]] during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song "Yankee Doodle Dixie", in which he played "[[Yankee Doodle]]" and "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]" simultaneously, on the same guitar.

Before his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. In 1987, he told [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine|''Nine-O-One Network'' magazine]] that he was "ashamed" of his promotion: "I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president."<ref>Nine-O-One Interview, Nine-O-One Network Magazine, December 1987, p.10-11</ref> He had brought [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[John Hartford]] to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others.<ref name="RockHall">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/chet-atkins "Chet Atkins"], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the [[civil rights movement]] sparked violence throughout the South, by signing country music's first African-American singer, [[Charley Pride]], who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.

Atkins's biggest hit single came in 1965, with "Yakety Axe", an adaptation of "[[Yakety Sax]]", by his friend, the saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]]. He rarely performed in those days and eventually hired other RCA producers, such as [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]], to lessen his workload.<ref name="mamg" />

===Later career===
In the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records, but could still turn out hits such as [[Perry Como]]'s 1973 pop hit "[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]". He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed, who had become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA Records, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with Reed or even Jethro Burns from Homer and Jethro (his brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.<ref name="mamg" /> Atkins would turn over his administrative duties to [[Jerry Bradley (music executive)|Jerry Bradley]], son of Owen, in 1973 at RCA.

Atkins did little production work at RCA after stepping down and in fact, had hired producers at the label in the 1960s, among them [[Bob Ferguson (musician)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]]. As a recording artist, Atkins grew disillusioned with RCA in the late 1970s. He felt stifled because the record company would not let him branch into jazz. He had also produced late '60s jazz recordings by Canadian guitarist [[Lenny Breau]], a friend and protege. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences, [[Les Paul]], ''[[Chester and Lester|Chester & Lester]]'' and ''[[Guitar Monsters]]'', had already reflected that interest; ''Chester & Lester'' was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkins's career. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch (no longer family-owned) was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]. In 1982, Atkins ended his 35-year association with RCA Records and signed with rival [[Columbia Records]]. He produced his first album for Columbia in 1983.<ref name="RollingStone" />

Atkins had always been an ardent lover of jazz and throughout his career he was often criticized by "pure" country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being referred to as a "country guitarist", insisting that he was "a guitarist, period." Although he played [[Playing by ear|by ear]] and was a masterful improviser, he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When [[Roger C. Field]], a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer, he did so with [[Suzy Bogguss]].<ref name="mamg"/>

Atkins returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with [[Mark Knopfler]] and Jerry Reed.<ref name="mamg" /> Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend [[Tommy Emmanuel]]. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the twentieth century, he named [[Django Reinhardt]] to the first position, and also placed himself on the list.<ref name="OfficialSite">[http://www.misterguitar.com/news/chetsten.html Official Web Site of Chet Atkins]. Accessed on August 27, 2014.</ref>

In later years, he returned to radio, appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' program, on [[American Public Media]] radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time,<ref name="mamg" /> and performing songs such as [[Bob Wills]]'s "[[Corrina, Corrina (song)|Corrina, Corrina]]" and [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Seven Spanish Angels]]" with Nelson on a 1985 broadcast of the show at the [[Bridges Auditorium]] on the campus of [[Pomona College]].

==Death and legacy==
Atkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy awards and nine Country Music Association awards for Instrumentalist of the Year.<ref name="RollingStone" /> In 1993, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ''Billboard'' magazine awarded him its Century Award, its "highest honor for distinguished creative achievement", in December 1997.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080205081628/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chetatkins/biography "Biography&nbsp;– Chet Atkins"]. ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on May 10, 2008.</ref> In 2002, Atkins was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="RockHall" /> His award was presented by [[Marty Stuart]] and [[Brian Setzer]] and accepted by Atkins's grandson, Jonathan Russell. The following year, Atkins ranked number 28 in [[Country Music Television]]'s "40 Greatest Men of Country Music". In November 2011, [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] ranked Atkins number 21 on their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="Chet Atkins"/>

Atkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of the stride pianist [[James P. Johnson]]'s "Johnson Rag", all the way to the rock stylings of [[Eric Johnson (guitarist, born 1954)|Eric Johnson]], an invited guest on Atkins's recording sessions, who, when Atkins attempted to copy his influential rocker "[[Cliffs of Dover (song)|Cliffs of Dover]]", led to Atkins's creation of a unique arrangement of "Londonderry Air (Danny Boy)".

The classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were, for many American artists working in the field today, the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded [[smooth jazz]] guitar still played on American airwaves.

Atkins continued performing in the 1990s, but his health declined after he was again diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996. He died on June 30, 2001, at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, at age 77.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html "Obituary"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323145021/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html |date=March 23, 2008 }}, CNN, July 2, 2001 Accessed June 21, 2008</ref> His memorial service was held at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/04/us/guitars-gently-weep-as-nashville-pays-tribute-to-chet-atkins.html|title=Guitars Gently Weep as Nashville Pays Tribute to Chet Atkins|date=July 4, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2016}}</ref> He was buried at Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens in Nashville.

[[Clint Black]]'s album ''[[Nothin' but the Taillights]]'' includes the song "Ode to Chet", which includes the lyrics "'Cause I can win her over like Romeo did Juliet, if I can only show her I can almost pick that legato lick like Chet" and "It'll take more than [[Mel Bay]] 1, 2, & 3 if I'm ever gonna play like CGP." Atkins played guitar on the track. At the end of the song, Black and Atkins had a brief conversation.

Atkins' song "Jam Man" is currently{{when|date=October 2022}} used in commercials for [[Esurance]].

In 1967, a tribute song, "Chet's Tune", was produced for Atkins' birthday, with contributions by a long list of RCA Victor artists, including [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Hank Snow]], and others. The song was written by the Nashville songwriter [[Cy Coben]], a friend of Atkins. The single reached number 38 on the country charts.<ref>Billboard, June 3, 1967, p. 41.</ref><ref>McClellan, John; Bratic, Deyan.

In 2009, [[Steve Wariner]] released an album titled ''My Tribute to Chet Atkins''.

'''Harold Lloyd Jenkins''' (September 1, 1933 – June 5, 1993), better known by his stage name '''Conway Twitty''', was an American singer and songwriter. Initially a part of the 1950s [[rockabilly]] scene, Twitty was best known as a [[country music]] performer. From 1971 to 1976, Twitty received a string of [[Country Music Association]] awards for duets with [[Loretta Lynn]]. He was inducted into both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music]] and [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame|Rockabilly]] Halls of Fame.

Twitty was known for his frequent use of romantic and sentimental themes in his songs. Due to his following being compared to a religious revival, comedian [[Jerry Clower]] nicknamed Twitty "The High Priest of Country Music", the eventual title of [[The High Priest of Country Music|his 33rd studio album]]. Twitty achieved stardom with hit songs like "[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]", "[[You've Never Been This Far Before]]" and "[[Linda on My Mind (song)|Linda on My Mind]]". Twitty topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]''{{'s}} [[Hot Country Songs]] chart 40 times in his career, a record that stood for two decades until it was surpassed by [[George Strait]], and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart once with "It's Only Make Believe". He wrote eleven of his [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]] chart-topping hits.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Conway Twitty |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/conway-twitty/ |access-date=8 March 2022 |website=Country Music Hall of Fame}}</ref>

==Early life==
Twitty was born Harold Lloyd Jenkins on September 1, 1933, in [[Friars Point, Mississippi]]. The Jenkins family were of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Breverton |first=Terry |title=Wales: A Historical Companion |date=2009 |publisher=Amberley |isbn=978-1848683266}}</ref> He was named by his great-uncle, after his favorite [[silent movie]] actor [[Harold Lloyd]]. The Jenkins family moved to [[Helena, Arkansas]], when Jenkins was 10 years old. In Helena, Jenkins performed on radio when he was 10, and he formed his first singing group, the [[Phillips County, Arkansas|Phillips County]] Ramblers when he was 12,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4AoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7|title=Conway Twitty: Magnolia Stater|magazine=Billboard |page=7 |date=October 20, 1958 }}</ref> and they had their own show on the local radio station KFFA every Saturday morning.<ref name=bronson>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVFLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA44 |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits |first= Fred |last=Bronson |date= 1997|isbn=9780823076413 |publisher=Billboard Books|page=44}}</ref> He preached at church revivals when he was a teenager.<ref name=bronson />

Twitty was a baseball player with a [[batting average]] of .450 when he graduated from high school, and he was offered a contract with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].<ref name=bronson /> He worked for a few months for [[International Harvester]] before accepting the Phillies offer.<ref name=bronson />  However, he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] and served in the [[Far East]], during which time he organized a group called the Cimmarons to entertain his fellow soldiers.<ref name="Billboard p. 58">{{Cite magazine |date=October 20, 1958 |title=Conway Twitty Magnolia Stater |page=58 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The Phillies renewed their offer when he returned home, but Twitty had by now become more interested in pursuing a music career.<ref name=bronson />

Soon after hearing [[Elvis Presley]]'s song "[[Mystery Train]]", Jenkins began writing rock & roll material. Elvis was a strong influence and Jenkins tried to sound like him. He formed a band called The Rockhousers and wrote a song called "Rockhouse".<ref name=mcdowell /> He went to the [[Sun Records|Sun Studios]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], a few times to record with [[Sam Phillips]], the owner and founder.<ref name=mcdowell /> Although he performed alongside Presley and other rock & roll pioneers throughout this period in a regional club scene situated within a 300-mile radius of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], Twitty expressed a fundamental ambivalence toward Phillips' [[rhythm and blues]]-based house production style in an interview for [[Tony Palmer (director)|Tony Palmer]]'s ''[[All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music]]'' (1976), noting that the producer's musical instincts subordinated many elements of Twitty's [[bluegrass music]]-influenced style.

None of Jenkins's Sun recordings were released at the time, but [[Roy Orbison]] did record his composition "Rockhouse" (given to Orbison by Phillips without Jenkins' approval), which was issued on SUN 251 (flipside "You're My Baby") in 1956.<ref name=mcdowell />

==Career==
===Stage name===
A member of Cimmarons suggested Don Seat as a manager for Jenkins, and Seat indicated to Jenkins that he needed a name with star quality. Jenkins then adopted a [[stage name]] in 1957.<ref name=bronson /> In ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits'', [[Fred Bronson]] states that the singer named himself after two towns on a map; [[Conway, Arkansas]], and [[Twitty, Texas]], and chose the name Conway Twitty.<ref name=bronson /><ref name="Larkin">{{Cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=May 27, 2011 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=9780857125958 |edition=5th |page=3571 |chapter=Twitty, Conway |access-date=April 15, 2017 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=PA3571}}</ref> Twitty himself confirmed this while appearing on the [[Late Night with David Letterman|''David Letterman Show'']] on March 30, 1989.<ref>[https://mix941kmxj.com/is-it-true-conway-twitty-really-got-his-name-from-two-texas-towns/ Is It True Conway Twitty Really Got His Name From two Texas Towns?

In 1957, under his new name, he recorded briefly for [[Mercury Records]], releasing two unsuccessful singles, "I Need Your Lovin'"/"Born to Sing the Blues" and "Shake It Up"/"Maybe Baby". "I Need Your Lovin'" reached only No. 93. Although he recorded three more songs with Mercury, his contract was soon terminated.<ref name=mcdowell />

===Rock and roll career===
In 1958, Twitty's fortunes improved when an Ohio radio station had an inspiration, refraining from playing "I'll Try" (an MGM single that went nowhere in terms of sales, radio play, and [[jukebox]] play), instead playing the B-side, "[[It's Only Make Believe]]", a song written between sets by Twitty and drummer Jack Nance when they were in Hamilton, Ontario, playing at the Flamingo Lounge.<ref name="MEMPROJ44">{{Cite press release |title=The Hamilton Memory Project |date=June 10, 2006 |publisher=Hamilton Spectator Newspaper, Souvenir Edition |page=MP44}}</ref> The record took several months to reach and stay at the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1958|top spot]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop music charts in the United States and number 1 in 21 other countries, becoming the first of nine top-40 hits for Twitty. It sold over four million copies and was awarded a [[music recording certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{Cite book |last=Murrells |first=Joseph |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/108 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins |year=1978 |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |edition=2nd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/108 108] |url-access=registration}}</ref> That same year, country singer Tabby West of ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' heard Twitty and booked him to appear on the show.<ref name="Billboard p. 58"/>

When "It's Only Make Believe" was first released, because of vocal similarities, many listeners assumed that the song was actually recorded by [[Elvis Presley]], using "Conway Twitty" as a pseudonym. Twitty would go on to enjoy rock-and-roll success with songs including "[[Danny Boy]]" (Pop number 10) and "[[Lonely Blue Boy (song)|Lonely Blue Boy]]" (Pop number 6). "Lonely Blue Boy", originally titled "Danny", was recorded by Presley for the film ''[[King Creole]]'' but was not used in the soundtrack. This song led to him naming his band the Lonely Blue Boys. They subsequently became the Twitty Birds.<ref name="Larkin"/> As his recording career continued, Twitty's music shifted from rockabilly to [[rock and roll]], and Twitty also recorded some [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] singles.<ref name=Koda/>

By 1965, Twitty had become disillusioned with rock & roll, particularly with the behavior of the fans,<ref name=ellison /> and walked out of a show in the middle of a performance in New Jersey.<ref name=bronson/> He sued his manager to be released from his contract, and moved to perform country music in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=ellison>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1qyHCmpT7EC&pg=PA248 |title=Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven|first= Curtis W. |last=Ellison |date= 1995|isbn=9781604739343 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=248}}</ref>

===Country music career===
Twitty always wanted to record country music, and, beginning in 1965, he did just that. Disc jockeys on some country-music radio stations refused to play his first few country albums, because he was known as a rock and roll singer. However, he had his first top-five country hit, "The Image of Me", in July 1968, followed by his first number one country song, "[[Next in Line (Conway Twitty song)|Next in Line]]", in November 1968. Few of his singles beginning in 1968 ranked below the top five.

In 1970, Twitty recorded and released his biggest country hit, "[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]", which spent four weeks at the top of the country chart and is one of Twitty's most recognized songs. In 1971, he released his first hit duet with [[Loretta Lynn]], "[[After the Fire Is Gone]]". It was a success, and many more followed, including "[[Lead Me On (Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn song)|Lead Me On]]" (1971), "[[Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man (song)|Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man]]" (1973), "[[As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone]]" (1974), "[[Feelins']]" (1975), "I Still Believe in Waltzes", "[[I Can't Love You Enough]]", and many others. Together, Conway and Loretta (as they were known in their act) won four consecutive [[Country Music Association]] awards for vocal duo (1972–1975) and a host of other duo and duet awards from other organizations throughout the 1970s.

In 1973, Twitty released "[[You've Never Been This Far Before]]", which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts. Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song, believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive.

In 1978, Twitty issued the single "The Grandest Lady of Them All" honoring the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. (Somewhat ironically, Twitty was never inducted into the ''Opry'' during his lifetime; he remains one of the more prominent [[Nashville]] country artists never to have been an Opry member.) The single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations; it was the first time since 1967 that a single of his failed to reach the top ten, as some radio stations refused to play a song honoring the property of a competitor (broadcast by [[WSM-AM]]).

Twitty soon renewed his image with a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] style to the curlier style he would keep for the rest of his life; by the late 1970s, Twitty had shifted his musical arrangements into a [[country pop]] style he would maintain for the rest of his career.<ref name=Kamau>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicrockhistory.com/top-10-conway-twitty-songs/ |title=Top 10 Conway Twitty Songs |last=Kamau |first=Eric |date=January 2022 |publisher=Classic Rock History |access-date=2022-11-18}}</ref> His next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 reaching number one, including "[[Don't Take It Away]]", "[[I May Never Get to Heaven]]", "[[Happy Birthday Darlin']]", and remakes of major pop hits such as "[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]", "[[Slow Hand]]" and "Tight Fittin' Jeans", a song written by Michael Huffman, released in June 1981 as the first single from the album ''Mr. T''. The song was Twitty's 26th number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of 10 weeks on the country chart. In 1985, going by all weekly music trade charts, the song "[[Don't Call Him a Cowboy]]" became the 50th single of his career to achieve a number-one ranking. He would have five more through 1990, giving him a total of 55 number-one hits. [[George Strait]] matched the feat of 50 number-one hits in 2002 with his single "[[She'll Leave You with a Smile]]" and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single "[[Wrapped (Bruce Robison song)|Wrapped]]" hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list.

Throughout much of Twitty's country music career his recording home was Decca Records, later renamed [[MCA Records|MCA]]. He signed with the label in late 1965 but left in 1981, when it appeared MCA was marketing and promoting newer acts; management at the label had changed, in addition to other factors that brought on the decision. He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label's country music unit merged with sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but then went back to MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, ''[[Final Touches]]''.

===Films===
Twitty had a short career in films, appearing in a few [[B-movies]] in 1960 in which he acted and sang, starting with ''[[Platinum High School]]'', followed by ''[[College Confidential (film)|College Confidential]]'' and ''[[Sex Kittens Go to College]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA409 |title=Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary|first= Richard |last=Carlin |date= 2014|isbn=9781135361044 |publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=409}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT4UAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA204 |title=All Roots Lead to Rock: Legends of Early Rock 'n' Roll : a Bear Family Reader |author= Bear Family Records |date= 1999 |publisher=Schirmer Books|page=204|isbn=9780028648668 }}</ref>

Twitty also played baseball, his second passion. He received an offer to play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school, but he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]] before he could sign the contract. Twitty joined the entrepreneur [[Larry Schmittou]] and other country musicians, such as [[Cal Smith]] and [[Jerry Reed]] in 1977 as investors in the [[Nashville Sounds]], a [[Minor League Baseball]] team of the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Southern League (1964–present)|Southern League]], which began playing in 1978.<ref>{{Citation |last=Woody |first=Larry |title=Schmittou: A Grand Slam in Baseball, Business, and Life |pages=64–65 |year=1996 |place=Nashville |publisher=Eggmann |isbn=1886371334}}</ref> Twitty threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the team's inaugural home opener at [[Herschel Greer Stadium]] on April 26, 1978.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 4, 2007 |title=Sounds in 1978 |url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Site=DN&Date=20070404&Category=SPORTS04&ArtNo=704040811&Ref=PH&Params=Itemnr=5 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150415152217/http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Site=DN&Date=20070404&Category=SPORTS04&ArtNo=704040811&Ref=PH&Params=Itemnr=5 |archive-date=April 15, 2015 |access-date=April 15, 2015 |location=Nashville |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]}}</ref> Twitty would also host celebrity softball games for charity, frequently playing against a team put together by [[Barbara Mandrell]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nashville Then: 1979 Fan Fair |url=https://www.tennessean.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/music/cma-music-festival/2019/06/05/nashville-then-1979-fan-fair-cma-fest-conway-twitty-loretta-lynn/1338559001/ |access-date=2021-11-09 |website=www.tennessean.com |language=en}}</ref>

===Twitty City===
Twitty lived for many years in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]], just north of Nashville, Tennessee, where he built a country music entertainment complex named [[Twitty City]] at a cost of over $3.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=1986 |title=Resources |journal=American Libraries |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=563–564 |jstor=25630104}}</ref> Twitty and Twitty City were once featured on the TV series ''[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]'', and were also seen in the Nashville episode of the BBC series ''Entertainment USA'', presented by [[Jonathan King]]. Opened in 1982, Twitty City was a popular tourist stop throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s; it was shut down in 1994 following a year-long tribute show called Final Touches, when fans and peers in the music business dropped by. The complex was auctioned off and bought by the Trinity Broadcasting Network in June 1994.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pinsky |first=Mark I |date=June 9, 1994 |title=Trinity Broadcasting Plans Entertainment Complex in Tennessee |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-06-09-ca-2370-story.html |access-date=November 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Twitty was married four times, to three different women. His first marriage, to Ellen Matthews, lasted from 1953 to 1954. They had married because Ellen was pregnant with their son, Michael. His second, and longest, marriage was to Temple "Mickey" Medley. They were married in 1956 and had three children: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. The couple were divorced in early 1970, but they remarried quietly by the end of 1970. By 1984, after 28 years of marriage on and off, the stress of Twitty's frequent absences took its toll on Mickey, and she and Conway divorced. Mickey Twitty died in 2021. In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores "Dee" Henry, who became his widow in June 1993.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hevesi |first=Dennis |date=June 6, 1993 |title=Conway Twitty, 59, Dies on Tour; Country Star Had 50 No. 1 Songs |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/obituaries/conway-twitty-59-dies-on-tour-country-star-had-50-no-1-songs.html |access-date=2021-11-09 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Twitty made [[Oklahoma City]] his home during most of his recording career, from 1963 to 1972. He also lived in Norman, Oklahoma. Twitty performed at the [[Diamond Ballroom]] after its opening in 1964. Conway Twitty opened one of his Twitty Burger restaurants at 7200 S. Western Avenue in Oklahoma City.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tramel |first=Jimmie |title=Jimmie Tramel: Conway Twitty's Oklahoma Years Put Kelly Lang on Path for Music Career |url=https://tulsaworld.com/entertainment/music/jimmie-tramel-conway-twittys-oklahoma-years-put-kelly-lang-on-path-for-music-career/article_8d58b134-4527-5a2b-ab10-13e8669dfa60.html |access-date=2021-11-09 |website=[[Tulsa World]] |date=August 10, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

In 1981, Twitty was exiting his tour bus when he slipped on the steps and fell, hitting his head against the steps. [[John Hughey]], who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, including family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident.

Twitty served on the board of directors of [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] (Country Music Television) from 1984 to 1988, after Music Village Group (Nyhl Henson, Gilbert Biggers, Hall Hardaway Jr. and Benny and Dean Jaggers) acquired CMTV from Glen Daniels. (Inheriting a copyright infringement suit from Viacom, owner of MTV, settled for an undisclosed sum.) The Music Village Group, built Music Village USA adjacent to Twitty City including a state-of-the-art 1,776-seat theatre where CMT uplinked its 24-hour programming and produced live concerts. When Music Village and Twitty was sold in 1989 and CMT in 1990, Conway turned his attention to the burgeoning [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] market playing to sell-out crowds. Twitty teamed up again with Nyhl Henson and his team to anchor the new musical home of Conway Twitty and inked the deal the day before his death in June 1993.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Death===
On June 4, 1993, Twitty became ill while performing at the Jim Stafford Theatre in Branson, Missouri.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nelson |first=Dick |date=20 May 2017 |title=Sunday Morning Country Classic Spotlight to Feature Conway Twitty [VIDEOS] |language=en |work=98.1 - Minnesota's New Country |url=https://minnesotasnewcountry.com/sunday-morning-country-classic-spotlight-to-feature-conway-twitty-videos/ |access-date=30 June 2021}}</ref> He collapsed on his tour bus after the show and was rushed to a hospital. He was rushed into surgery, but died of an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], in the early hours of the following morning at Cox South Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, at the age of 59. [[Loretta Lynn]], who frequently was his chart-making duet partner, was at the hospital because her husband, Mooney, a.k.a. Doo, was recovering from heart surgery, and saw Twitty briefly as he entered the hospital.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Grigsby |first=Karen |date=5 June 2018 |title=Conway Twitty died 25 years ago today: How his legacy lives on |work=The Tennessean |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/06/05/conway-twitty-death-25-years-country-music-cma-fest/656278002/ |access-date=30 June 2021}}</ref> His last studio album, ''[[Final Touches]]'', was released two months later. Four months after Twitty's death, [[George Jones]] included a cover version of "[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]" on his album ''[[High-Tech Redneck]]''.

Twitty was buried at Sumner Memorial Gardens in Gallatin, Tennessee, in a red granite vault under his birth name Harold L. Jenkins. There are spaces reserved next to him for his wife and his son Michael.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite court |litigants=In re Estate of Jenkins |vol=No. 93P-30 |court=Probate Court for Sumner County, Tom E.

===Estate lawsuits===
After Twitty's death, his estate became entangled in a lengthy court saga between the estate and family members, heirs, employees and others that lasted over a decade.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{Cite news |title=Conway Twitty Family Feuds Over Estate |language=en |work=AP NEWS |url=https://apnews.com/article/a11e11ebb7510490e824971183060db2 |access-date=1 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Squabbles Between Conway Twitty's Heirs Highlight the Importance of a Properly Updated Estate Plan {{!}} McMullan & Brown {{!}} Little Rock, Arkansas |work=McMullan & Brown |url=https://www.m-b.law/squabbles-between-conway-twitty-s-heirs-highlight-the-importance-of-a-properly-updated-estate-plan/ |access-date=1 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Twitty Estate To Be Divided |work=CMT News |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1475896/twitty-estate-to-be-divided/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227161815/http://www.cmt.com/news/1475896/twitty-estate-to-be-divided/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 27, 2021 |access-date=1 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Benefield |first=Chadwick |title=Conway Twitty's Will the Subject of Investigation Discovery [Video] |language=en |work=WBKR |url=https://wbkr.com/conway-twittys-will-the-subject-of-investigation-discovery-video/ |access-date=1 July 2021}}</ref> In one instance, the estate sued his two daughters, claiming loans were due to be repaid. Five years after his death, The Tennessee Appeals Court referred to that case in its opening sentence with, "This is yet another chapter in the administration of the estate of Harold L. Jenkins, a popular entertainer whose stage name was 'Conway Twitty.'" The court sided with the daughters finding that the accountants and controllers of Twitty's books while he was alive, who later became the executors of the estate, kept "limited and sketchy information" when it came to the family members.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ESTATE OF HAROLD JENKINS v.

The court found Twitty rarely, if ever, memorialized contracts with family members, contractors and employees in writing. Oral promises included bonuses of $1000 per year of employment. The estate attempted to reduce that to $100 per year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Claim of BILLY R.

==Posthumous releases==
Since his death, Twitty's son Michael and grandson Tre have been carrying on his musical legacy. Conway's most recent appearance on the country charts was a duet with [[Anita Cochran]], "(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song" (2004), which was made possible by splicing Twitty's vocal from old recordings and interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty's isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like the electronic duets of [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]], or [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Natalie Cole]], Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty's reconstructed vocals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Currently, Bear Family Records offers the single-disc collection ''Conway Rocks'', featuring 30 songs, and ''The Rock 'n' Roll Years'', a comprehensive eight-disc box set showcasing his complete early recordings as a rock artist.<ref>[https://www.bear-family.com/twitty-conway/ Who was/is Twitty, Conway?] Bear Family Records.</ref>

==Legal issues==
===Taxes===
Twitty's success in country music was a key factor in his winning the 1983 case ''Harold L. Jenkins (a/k/a Conway Twitty) v. Commissioner'' in United States Tax Court. The Internal Revenue Service allowed Twitty to deduct from his taxes, as an "ordinary and necessary" business expense, payments that he had made to repay investors in a defunct fast-food chain called Twitty Burger; the chain disestablished in 1971. The general rule is that the payment of someone else's debts is not deductible. Twitty alleged that his primary motive was "protecting his personal business reputation." The court opinion contained testimony from Twitty about his bond with country music fans.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Google Scholar |url=https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=10329305433284389410&q=%22memo+1983-667%22 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |publisher=Scholar.google.ca}}</ref> The Tax Court ruled in Twitty's favor and allowed him to deduct these repayments.

===Estate===
Twitty married four times (twice to Mickey). His widow in 1993, Delores "Dee" Henry Jenkins, and his four grown children from the previous marriages, Michael, [[Joni Lee|Joni]], Kathy and Jimmy Jenkins, engaged in a public dispute over the estate. Twitty's will had not been updated to account for the fourth marriage, but Tennessee law reserves one third of any estate to the widow. After years of probate, the four children received the rights to Twitty's music, name and image. The rest of the estate went to public auction, where much of the property and memorabilia was sold after his widow rejected the appraised value.

In 2008, controversy again erupted in his family when the four remaining children sued [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] over an agreement that Twitty and his family signed in 1990. The suit alleged that the terms of the agreement were not fully understood by the children, although they were all adults at the time. It sought to recover copyrights and royalty revenue that the document assigned to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 1, 2008 |title=Twitty's children sue Sony for royalties |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712082622/http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

'''David Albert Alvin''' (born November 11, 1955) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer. He is a former and founding member of the [[roots rock]] band [[the Blasters]]. Alvin has recorded and performed as a solo artist since the late 1980s and has been involved in various side projects and collaborations. He has had brief stints as a member of the bands [[X (U.S. band)|X]] and [[the Knitters]]. He often refers to himself as "Blackjack Dave," in reference to his 1998 album and song of the same name.

== Early life ==
Alvin grew up in [[Downey, California]]. He and his older brother, [[Phil Alvin]], as teenagers frequented [[blues]], [[rockabilly]] and [[country music]] venues.<ref name="All Music bio">Deming, Mark. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dave-alvin-mn0000679219/biography Dave Alvin: Biography].

== Career ==
=== With the Blasters ===
In 1979, Alvin and his brother Phil formed the roots-rock band [[The Blasters]] with fellow Downey residents [[Bill Bateman (drummer)|Bill Bateman]] and [[John Bazz]].<ref name="All Music bio" /><ref name="Blasters bio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-blasters-mn0000757177/biography | title=Artist Biography: The Blasters | publisher=AllMusic.com | author=Sullivan, Denise | author-link=Denise Sullivan }}</ref> Alvin served as the group's lead guitarist and chief songwriter.<ref name="Blasters bio" /> ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' noted the ever-increasing numbers of originals that Alvin wrote for the Blasters, along with his maturation into a great songwriter.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Rough Guide to Rock | publisher=Rough Guides | editor1=Buckley, Peter|editor2=Buckley, Jonathan| year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 106] | isbn=978-1-85828-457-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/106 }}</ref>

Other artists have covered Alvin's songs. For example, "[[Marie Marie]]" became a British-German top 20 hit in 1980 for [[Shakin' Stevens]] and received a [[zydeco]] treatment in 1987 from [[Buckwheat Zydeco]]. [[Dwight Yoakam]] recorded "Long White Cadillac" in 1989.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin was in the original lineup until 1986. His departure reflected internal tension in the band, but ultimately he wanted to sing his own songs while his brother [[Phil Alvin]] was the established lead vocalist for the group.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article36306066.html |author=Sculley, Alan |title=Alvin brothers: Losing no more time playing apart |work=Sacramento Bee |date=September 23, 2015 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

Alvin has rejoined the Blasters for some reunion tours and live albums with the original lineup. He has also occasionally performed with the band under other circumstances as well.<ref name="rosen">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/entertainment/tn-blr-1216-the-blasters-frontman-phil-alvin-takes-to-the-stage-new-years-eve-after-a-scary-2012-story.html |author=Rosen, Craig |title=The Blasters' frontman Phil Alvin takes to the stage New Year's Eve after a scary 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 15, 2012 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== With X and the Knitters ===
Alvin served a brief stint as the lead guitarist of the Los Angeles–based [[alternative rock]] band [[X (American band)|X]]. He left X in 1987 to work on a solo project after the group recorded their album ''[[See How We Are]]''.

Alvin was also a member of the [[country folk]] band [[The Knitters]], an offshoot of X. He appeared on their 1985 album  ''Poor Little Critter on the Road'' and their 2005 follow-up, ''The Modern Sounds of the Knitters''.<ref name="All Music bio" />

=== With the Flesh Eaters ===
In the early 1980s, Alvin, along with fellow Blasters members Bill Bateman and [[Steve Berlin]], performed on ''[[A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (album)|A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die]]'' by the Los Angeles [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[the Flesh Eaters]]. This lineup, which also included [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] and [[D.J. Bonebrake]], assembled once again in 2006, performing three shows in California and one in England to mark the album's 25th anniversary. They reunited briefly in 2015 for a five-show tour and again for an eight-show run in 2018. They issued a new album, ''[[I Used to Be Pretty]]'', in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://americanahighways.org/2019/03/19/show-review-flesh-eaters-rock-dcs-union-stage-with-porcupine/ |author=Cook, Glenn. |title=Show Review: Flesh Eaters Rock DC's Union Stage With Porcupine |work=Americana Highways |date=March 19, 2019 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>

=== Solo ===
[[File:Dave Alvin.jpg|thumb|Alvin in 2007]]
Alvin's first solo album, ''Romeo's Escape'' (entitled ''Every Night About This Time'' in England), was released in 1987. It was well received by critics but did not sell well. Because of the album's low sales, Alvin's recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] was terminated. He then toured with [[Mojo Nixon]] and [[Beat Farmers|Country Dick Montana]], billed as the Pleasure Barons; an album recorded live on their 1993 tour was released.<ref name="All Music bio" />

Alvin's second solo album, ''Blue Blvd'', was released by [[Hightone Records]] in 1991. It received positive reviews and had moderate sales. His album ''Museum of Heart'' was released in 1993. He recorded ''[[King of California (album)|King of California]]'', an album of [[acoustic music]], in 1994. In 2000, he recorded the album ''[[Public Domain (album)|Public Domain: Songs From the Wild Land]]'', a collection of traditional folk and blues classics, which earned him a [[Grammy]] award for Best Contemporary [[Folk music|Folk]] Album.<ref name="All Music bio" />

In 2011, Alvin recorded the album ''[[Eleven Eleven (Dave Alvin album)|Eleven Eleven]]'', released by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The album marked his return to rock roots.<ref name="rs">{{cite magazine|last=Scherman|first=Tony|title=Dave Alvin: Eleven Eleven|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 21, 2011|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/eleven-eleven-20110621}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in a review of the album, called Alvin "an underrecognized guitar hero".<ref name="rs" />

=== Further recordings with Phil Alvin ===
In 2014, Dave and Phil Alvin, as a duo, released the album ''Common Ground'', consisting of their versions of songs by [[Big Bill Broonzy]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5908507/the-blasters-dave-phil-alvin-talk-common-ground-album-premiere-all-by-myself-song-listen-exclusive | title=Dave Alvin & Phil Alvin Talk 'Common Ground' Album, Premiere 'All By Myself' Song: Listen Exclusively | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=February 19, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Gallo, Phil}}</ref> It was the first studio collaboration of the brothers since the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-torn-up-band-of-brothers-finally-on-the-mend-1401411544 | title=A Torn-Up Band of Brothers, Finally on the Mend | work=[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] | date=May 29, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Dougherty, Steve}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-alvin-brothers-20140608-story.html#page=1 | title=Dave and Phil Alvin, Former Blasters Mates, Resurrect Partnership | work=Los Angeles Times | date=June 6, 2014 | access-date=June 26, 2014 | author=Lewis, Randy}}</ref> In 2015 they released ''Lost Time'', a collection of covers including four songs by [[Big Joe Turner]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dave Alvin: Return of the Battlin' Brothers|page=24|date=March 2016|newspaper=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|last=Cohen|first=Elliot Stephen}}</ref>

=== With Jimmie Dale Gilmore ===
Alvin and Texas singer-songwriter [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] teamed on the 2018 album ''Downey to Lubbock'' (the title is a reference to where each man grew up).

As seen in his live performances with brother Phil, Alvin's stories between songs were a notable part of the stage shows with Gilmore and their supporting musicians.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://glidemagazine.com/214083/dave-alvin-and-jimmie-dale-gilmore-prove-perfect-collaborators-in-portland-show-review-photos/ |author=Ferguson, Neil |title=Dave Alvin and Jimmie Dale Gilmore Prove Perfect Collaborators in Portland |work=Glide Magazine |date=October 1, 2018 |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>

In April 2022, Alvin announced his return to public performance after a grueling two-year battle with different forms of cancer that started in May 2020. He chose to do so with Gilmore, scheduling nine dates in California for late June and early July 2022.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/dave-alvin-cancer-interview-1336284/ |author=Bernstein, Jonathan |title='I Should Have Died': Dave Alvin, Seminal California Country-Punk Guitarist, Talks Private Cancer Battle |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2022 |access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>

'''Doyle Floyd Hendricks''' (June 30, 1936 – January 13, 2007), known by the stage name '''Doyle Holly''', was an American musician best known as the [[bass guitar]] player of the [[country music]] band [[Buck Owens]] and [[the Buckaroos]] and for his solo hit songs "[[Queen Of The Silver Dollar]]" and "Lila". Holly's contributions on [[bass guitar]] and [[rhythm guitar]] were a key component of the [[Bakersfield sound]]. The Buckaroos had more than 30 [[Top 40]] [[single (music)|singles]] on the country music charts in the 1960s and early 1970s, with 21 number one hits such as "[[I've Got a Tiger By the Tail]]," "Love's Gonna Live Here,"and "[[Act Naturally]]." Their sound influenced later artists such as [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[The Eagles]], [[The Derailers]] and the [[Desert Rose Band]].

==Early life==
Holly was born in [[Perkins, Oklahoma|Perkins]], Oklahoma. As a young man, he spent four years in the [[United States Army]]<ref name="rcnv3">{{cite web| last =Morrison| first =Bill| title =Rockabilly Country News & Views| publisher =Rockabilly Hall of Fame| date =September 2005| url =http://www.rockabillyhall.com/rcnv3.html| access-date =2007-05-26| archive-date =2016-03-03| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221401/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/rcnv3.html| url-status =dead}}</ref> and worked in oil fields in [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and [[California]].<ref name="cst">{{cite web|last =Johnson| first =Jon| title =Doyle Holly and the Buckaroos are together again| work =CountryStandardTime.com| publisher =Jeffrey Remz|date=June 2003|url =http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?fn=doyleholly.asp|access-date =2007-05-25}}</ref> He eventually made his way to [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California, where he discovered the country and rock music scene in the area.

==The Buckaroos==
Holly was playing with [[Joe Maphis]] in 1963 when he was asked by [[Don Rich]] to fill in as bassist for the Buckaroos.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Randy |title=Doyle Holly, bass player for Buck Owens' Buckaroos |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 17, 2007 |url=http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=330691 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191714/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=330691 |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> The spot became his permanently after [[Merle Haggard]] left the group,<ref name="latimes" /> and the Buckaroos began their most creative and successful period, from 1963 to 1971. The group had more than 30 singles in the country music top 40 in that time, of which more than half went to No.&nbsp;1. "[[Act Naturally]]," a No.&nbsp;1 single for the Buckaroos in 1963, was [[cover version|covered]] by [[The Beatles]] on their 1965 album ''[[Help!]]'' <ref name="cst" /> Other hits included "I've Got A Tiger By The Tail," "[[Together Again (Buck Owens song)|Together Again]]," and "Love's Gonna Live Here," which occupied the top position on the country chart for 17 weeks near the end of 1963.<ref name="cst" /><ref name="latimes" />

The Buckaroos recorded a live album, [[Carnegie Hall Concert (Buck Owens album)|Carnegie Hall Concert]] in 1966, which Holly said was his favorite recording as a Buckaroo. At the time, it was only the second album recorded at [[Carnegie Hall]] by a country music group, and it is widely regarded as one of the best live albums in country music history.<ref name="cst" />

The concert had been oversold and the venue was packed with fans, many sitting in the aisles. During the Carnegie Hall concert, the Buckaroos returned a favor to [[The Beatles]] and played "[[Twist and Shout]]" while wearing Beatles wigs.<ref name="cst" />

Holly and the Buckaroos toured widely in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] in the 1960s. During the band's peak of popularity in the mid to late 1960s, it seemed like everyone was a Buckaroos fan including [[the Beatles]], who, it is said, had a standing order for all new Buck Owens and the Buckaroos records to be forwarded to them in England.<ref name="cst" />
While on tour in London in 1969, Holly, Owens and Don Rich met up [[John Lennon]] and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="cst" />
Holly recorded seven albums with [[The Buckaroos]] from 1968-1970 without Buck Owens, all of which were chart topping records. The Buckaroos albums contained instrumentals along with Holly and [[Don Rich]] sharing the role of lead vocalists, each having solo songs on every album. The band won a number of awards, including [[Grammy]]s and [[Country Music Association|CMA]]s (Country Music Awards). While Holly was with [[The Buckaroos]] they were nominated as "Band Of The Year" seven consecutive years from the [[Academy of Country Music]] from 1965 to 1971, winning the award four years in a row from 1965-1968. They were also nominated as "Instrumental Group of the Year" for five consecutive years from 1967-1971 by the Country Music Awards, winning twice in 1967 and 1968.<ref>[http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/database/ArtistDetail.aspx?artistId=764 Country Music Awards entry for The Buckaroos.]</ref>

In 1968, [[Buck Owens]] and [[the Buckaroos]] recorded a live album when they performed at the White House for President [[Lyndon Johnson]].

'''Duane Eddy''' (April 26, 1938 – April 30, 2024) was an American [[rock and roll]] guitarist. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he had a string of hit records produced by [[Lee Hazlewood]] which were noted for their characteristically "twangy" guitar sound, including "[[Rebel-'Rouser]]", "[[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn]]", and "[[Because They're Young (song)|Because They're Young]]".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/may/03/duane-eddy-obituary Duane Eddy obituary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240503143718/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/may/03/duane-eddy-obituary |date=May 3, 2024 }}, The Guardian, 3 May 2024</ref>  He had sold 12 million records by 1963. His guitar style influenced [[the Ventures]], [[the Shadows]], [[the Beatles]] (especially their lead guitarist [[George Harrison]]), [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Marty Stuart]].<ref name=times_5_2024>Duane Eddy, The Times Register, 3 May 2024</ref><ref name="CMHoF"/>

Eddy was not happy with his singing voice,<ref name=times_5_2024/> and he devised a technique of playing lead lines on his guitar's bass strings to produce a low, reverberant "[[twang]]y" sound instead.<ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> At the age of 19, he had acquired a 1957 [[Chet Atkins]] model [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar from Ziggie's Music in Phoenix,<ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> and in November 1957, he recorded an instrumental piece, "Movin' n' Groovin'", which he co-wrote with Hazlewood.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-07-12 |title=The Once and Future Story of The Gretsch Company |url=https://mmrmagazine.com/site/issue/special-report/the-once-and-future-story-of-the-gretsch-company/ |access-date=2024-05-02 |website=Mmrmagazine.com |archive-date=May 5, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240505121434/https://mmrmagazine.com/site/issue/special-report/the-once-and-future-story-of-the-gretsch-company/ |url-status=live }}</ref> His backing band included saxophonist [[Steve Douglas (musician)|Steve Douglas]], pianist [[Larry Knechtel]], and bassist [[Al Casey (rock guitarist)|Al Casey]].<ref name=times_5_2024/> As the Phoenix studio had no [[echo chamber]], Hazlewood bought a 2,000-gallon (7570-litre) water storage tank to use as an echo chamber to accentuate the "twangy" guitar sound.<ref>Twangin' From Phoenix To L.A.: The Jamie Years, Bear Family Records – BCD 15778</ref><ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> In 1958, Eddy signed a [[recording contract]] with Lester Sill and Hazlewood to record in Phoenix at the Audio Recorders studio.

On January 9, 1958, Eddy's debut album, ''[[Have 'Twangy' Guitar Will Travel]]'', was released. It reached number five on the album chart<ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> and remained there for 82 weeks. Duane Eddy and the Rebels appeared six times on ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]'' between 1958 and 1960. On Eddy's fourth album, ''Songs of Our Heritage'' (1960), each track featured him playing acoustic guitar or [[banjo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/philadelphia/jamie/jamie.html |title=Jamie Album Discography |website=Bsnpubs.com |date=April 5, 2014 |access-date=October 27, 2015 |archive-date=August 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805140849/http://bsnpubs.com/philadelphia/jamie/jamie.html |url-status=live }}</ref> His biggest hit came with the theme of the movie ''[[Because They're Young]]'' in 1960,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" /> which featured a string arrangement.

In 1960, Eddy signed a contract directly with Jamie Records, bypassing Sill and Hazlewood, which caused a temporary rift between Eddy and Hazlewood.<ref name="Guardian obituary"></ref> The result was that for the duration of his contract with Jamie, Eddy produced his own singles and albums.

In the 1960s, Eddy launched an acting career, appearing in such films as ''[[Because They're Young]]'', ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'', ''[[The Wild Westerners]]'', ''[[Kona Coast (film)|Kona Coast]]'', and ''[[The Savage Seven]].''<ref name="ls" /><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/23659|title=AFI&#124;Catalog|website=Catalog.afi.com|access-date=May 2, 2024|archive-date=May 2, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240502104349/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/23659|url-status=live}}</ref>  In 1961, he signed a three-year contract with [[Paul Anka]]'s production company, Camy, whose recordings were issued by [[RCA Victor]].<ref name="AMG" /> In the early days of recording in the RCA Victor studios, he renewed contact with Lee Hazlewood, who became involved in a number of his RCA Victor singles and albums.

Eddy performed on the [[BBC]] television show "[[Top of the Pops]]" while promoting the single.<ref name="CMHoF"/>  A recording of "You Are My Sunshine", featuring [[Willie Nelson]], Waylon Jennings, and Eddy's third wife Deed, appeared in the country charts in 1977.<ref>{{citation |title=Duane Eddy |url=https://guitarsexchange.com/en/unplugged/730/duane-eddy/ |access-date=2024-05-02 |website=Guitarsexchange.com |language=en |archive-date=May 2, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240502060059/https://guitarsexchange.com/en/unplugged/730/duane-eddy/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="CMHoF"/>

'''William Edwin Bruce Jr.''' (December 29, 1939 – January 8, 2021) was an American [[country music]] songwriter, singer, and actor. He was known for writing the 1975 song "[[Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]" and recording the 1982 country number one hit "[[You're the Best Break This Old Heart Ever Had]]".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Balk |first1=Tim |title=Ed Bruce, country singer who wrote iconic tune, dies at 81 |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-ed-bruce-dies-outlaw-country-singer-mama-cowboys-20210108-xe7votdvzvexvhwzld6ahrjzey-story.html |work=nydailynews.com}}</ref> He also co-starred in the television series ''[[Bret Maverick]]'' with [[James Garner]] during the 1981–1982 season.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=2021-01-08|title=Ed Bruce, Writer of Country Classic 'Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,' Dies at 81|url=https://variety.com/2021/music/news/ed-bruce-dead-country-singer-songwriter-mammas-cowboys-maverick-1234881534/|access-date=2021-02-02|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Early life==
Bruce was born in [[Keiser, Arkansas|Keiser]], [[Arkansas]], United States, and grew up in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name="tennessean"/> In 1957, at the age of 17, he went to see [[Jack Clement]], a recording engineer for [[Sun Records]]. Bruce caught the attention of Sun owner [[Sam Phillips]], for whom he wrote and recorded "Rock Boppin' Baby" (as "Edwin Bruce").

==1960s==
In the early 1960s, Bruce recorded for [[RCA Records|RCA]] and some smaller labels like [[Wand Records|Wand]]/[[Scepter Records|Scepter]], singing [[rockabilly]] music, as well as country material and pop material such as "See the Big Man Cry". In 1962, he wrote "Save Your Kisses" for pop star [[Tommy Roe]] and in 1963 he reached No.&nbsp;109 on the ''Billboard'' "Bubbling Under" chart with his own recording of "See the Big Man Cry" (Wand 140), both published by [[Bill Justis]] at Tuneville Music. [[Charlie Louvin]] recorded "See the Big Man Cry" (Capitol 5369) in 1965; Louvin's version reached No.&nbsp;7 on the ''Billboard'' "Country Singles" chart. During his career many songs that Bruce wrote and recorded were more successful when re-recorded by others.

In 1966, Bruce returned to [[RCA Records|RCA]] and recorded "Puzzles", "The Price I Pay to Stay" and "Lonesome Is Me". He scored his first charted single with "Walker's Woods" in 1967, and also charted with his version of [[The Monkees]]' "[[Last Train to Clarksville]]". Both of these singles were minor hits. In 1969, Bruce signed with [[Monument Records]], where he continued to have minor successes with "Everybody Wants To Get To Heaven" and "Song For Jenny".

==1970s==
Bruce wrote "[[The Man That Turned My Mama On]]" which became a major hit for [[Tanya Tucker]] in 1974, as was his "Restless" for [[Crystal Gayle]] the same year. He signed with [[United Artists Records]] in 1973 and released several singles, but only one single in 1974 became a minor hit. Bruce finally made the Top 20 on country charts with his version of "[[Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]", a song he wrote with then-wife [[Patsy Bruce]], in 1976.

Two more Top 40 hits followed for Bruce in 1976, and in 1977, he signed with [[Epic Records]] where he would score minor hits. In 1978, "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow up to Be Cowboys" was recorded by [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Waylon Jennings]]. It became a major hit, and continued the upward swing in Bruce's career. In 1979, Tanya Tucker took Bruce's 1977 song "[[Texas (When I Die)]]" into the country Top 5.

==1980s==
In 1980, Bruce signed with [[MCA Records]], where he would score his biggest successes. His early hits with MCA included "Diane", "The Last Cowboy Song", "When You Fall In Love (Everything's A Waltz)", "Evil Angel", and "Love's Found You And Me". His biggest hit, "[[You're the Best Break This Old Heart Ever Had]]" went to number one on the country chart in 1982. This was also Bruce's first Top 10 hit as a singer after 15 years. He had other hit songs that made the Top 10 like "Ever, Never Lovin' You"; "My First Taste of Texas"; and "After All".

In 1984, Bruce returned to [[RCA Records]] and scored a No. 3 hit with "You Turn Me On Like A Radio" in 1985. His last Top 10 single was "[[Nights (Ed Bruce song)|Nights]]" in 1986 and his last Top 40 single (and last chart single to date) was "Quietly Crazy" in 1987.

==Acting==
Bruce supplemented his songwriting income doing [[voice-overs]] for [[television commercials|television]] and [[radio commercials]].<ref name="Country Music Television">{{cite web|title=Country Music – Music News, New Songs, Videos, Music Shows and Playlists from CMT|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/bruce_ed/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040730164351/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/bruce_ed/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 30, 2004|access-date=August 28, 2018|website=Cmt.com}}</ref> After the 1986 album entitled ''Night Things'' and a [[country music|1988]] self-titled follow-up, Bruce made a conscious decision to cut back on his music to focus on his acting career, appearing in several [[made-for-TV]] films.<ref name="Country Music Television" /> He hosted two shows in the late 1980s, ''Truckin' USA'' and ''American Sports Cavalcade''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Ed Bruce's Web Site!|url=http://edbrucemusic.com/|access-date=August 28, 2018|website=Edbrucemusic.com}}</ref> He had the second lead on the [[television]] revival of 1957's ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', called ''[[Bret Maverick]]''.

Bruce played the irascibly surly town lawman who found himself reluctantly co-owning a saloon with Maverick, with whom he seemed to maintain a surreally adversarial relationship more or less throughout the entire season. Bruce sang and wrote the theme song to the show,<ref name="imdb">{{cite web

'''Ray Edward Cochran''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|r|ən}} {{respell|KOK|rən}}; October 3, 1938 – April 17, 1960), known professionally as '''Eddie Cochran''',  was an American [[rock and roll]] musician. His songs, such as "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]", "[[Summertime Blues]]", "[[C'mon Everybody]]" and "[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.<ref name="RRHOF">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Eddie Cochran: Hall of Fame Essay|work=Inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|location=Cleveland, Ohio|year=1987|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/eddie-cochran/|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Cochran experimented with [[multitrack recording]], distortion techniques, and [[overdubbing]], even on his earliest singles.<ref name=Cochran2003>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Bobby|author-link=Bobby Cochran|last2=Van Hecke|first2=Susan|title=Three Steps to Heaven: The Eddie Cochran Story|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=2003|isbn=978-0634032523}}</ref> Cochran played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.<ref name=RRHOF/> His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death, Cochran achieved iconic status.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2020|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-cochran-mn0000793988/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>

Cochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.<ref name=Cochran2003/> In 1955, Cochran formed a duo with the guitarist [[Hank Cochran]] (no relation) and became known as the Cochran Brothers. When they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with [[Jerry Capehart]]. His first success came when he performed the song "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', starring [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] and his first record for the label, "[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]", rose to number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]].

Cochran died at the age of 21 in St Martin's Hospital, [[Bath, Somerset]], after a car accident in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]], at the end of his British tour with [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.  On April 16, after they had just performed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]], on their way to their next venue, Vincent, Cochran and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi. The other two passengers survived with major injuries, but Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.

Though Cochran's best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists. [[Paul McCartney]] himself chose Cochran's "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" as his audition piece, assured to impress [[John Lennon]] by his performance of it, which he did and was hired as a member of Lennon's [[skiffle]] group [[The Quarrymen]], which later was renamed [[The Beatles]].

==Early life==
Cochran was born on October 3, 1938, in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], to Alice and Frank R. Cochran. He was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name="Cochran2003" /> Cochran's parents were from Oklahoma. Cochran took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Additionally, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.

In 1952, Cochran's family moved to [[Bell Gardens, California]]. As his guitar playing improved, Cochran formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. In January 1955, Cochran dropped out of [[Bell Gardens High School]] in his first year to become a professional musician.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |year=2020 |title=Eddie Cochran Biography |url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/features/eddie-cochran |access-date=April 14, 2020 |work=Featured Pages |publisher=Gretsch Guitars |location=Savannah, Georgia}}</ref>

==Career==
=== The Cochran Brothers (1955–1956) ===
[[File:The Cochran Brothers.jpg|thumb|The Cochran Brothers]]
During a show featuring many performers at an [[American Legion]] hall, Cochran met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter. Although they were not related, they recorded as the Cochran Brothers and began performing together.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Alan|title=Eddie Cochran|work=Rockabilly Legends|publisher=[[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]|location=Nashville, Tennessee|year=2020|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/EddieCochran.html|access-date=April 14, 2020|archive-date=April 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411042315/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/EddieCochran.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> They recorded a few singles for [[Ekko Records]] that were fairly successful and helped to establish them as a performing act.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cochran Brothers |url=https://rcs-discography.com/rcs/search.php?type=acode&key=coch7500 |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=RCS-Discography.com}}</ref> Eddie Cochran also worked as a session musician and began writing songs, making a demo with [[Jerry Capehart]], his future [[music manager|manager]].

=== Solo and film appearances (1956–1959) ===
In July 1956, Eddie Cochran's first "solo artist" single was released by [[Crest Records]].<ref name=bigvjamboree>{{cite web|last=Vidal|first=Paul|title=The Crest Records Story|work=The Labels
|publisher=Paul Vidal Enterprises, Inc.|year=2020|url=http://www.bigvjamboree.com/CREST-RECORDS.html|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> It featured "Skinny Jim", now regarded as a rock-and-roll and rockabilly classic. In the spring of 1956, [[Boris Petroff]] asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956). Cochran agreed and performed the song "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" in the movie. In 1957, Cochran starred in his second film, ''[[Untamed Youth]]'' (1957), and had yet another hit, "[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]", one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case [[John D. Loudermilk]]). "Twenty Flight Rock" was written by AMI staff writer [[Ned Fairchild]] (a pen name—her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran's major changes and contributions to the final product.

==== ''Singin' to My Baby'' (1957) ====
In the summer of 1957, [[Liberty Records]] issued Cochran's only studio album released during his lifetime, ''[[Singin' to My Baby]]''. The album included John D. Loudermilk's "Sittin' in the Balcony". For the album, Cochran worked with manager and songwriter [[Jerry Capehart]], and wrote the songs "Completely Sweet", "Undying Love", "When I'm Mad", and Cochran original "One Kiss".<ref>{{Cite web |date=1957 |title=Eddie Cochran With The Johnny Mann Orchestra And Chorus – Singin' To My Baby |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/290087-Eddie-Cochran-With-The-Johnny-Mann-Orchestra-And-Chorus-Singin-To-My-Baby |access-date=May 25, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>

In 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem "[[Summertime Blues]]" (co-written with Jerry Capehart). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] recording no. 55144, charted at number&nbsp;8 in 1958.

Originally, Cochran toured with [[The Kelly Four]] as his backing band, guitarist [[Mike Deasy]], saxophonist Mike Henderson, bassist [[Dave Shriver]], and drummer [[Gene Riggio]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kelly Four Discography {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2874069-The-Kelly-Four |access-date=May 27, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref> They were known as The Hollywood Swingers, a reference to [[Dick D'Agostin]]'s band. The line-up of Cochran's touring band would change overtime, with saxophonist [[Seals and Crofts|Jim Seals]] and bassist [[Connie 'Guybo' Smith]], and the addition of pianist [[Jim Stivers]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Seals session with Eddie Cochran |url=http://thompsonian.info/sealsec.html |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=thompsonian.info}}</ref> They were eventually joined by various members from Dick D'Agostin and The Swingers. In 1959, The Swingers line-up became [[Multi-instrumentalist|muti-instrumentalist]] with pianist Dick D'Agostin, pianist Jim Stivers (briefly on bass), guitarist [[Larry D'Agostin]], saxophonist [[Paul Kaufman]], and drummer Gene Riggio. However, D'Agostin left and was called-up to enlist into the U.S. Army. Members from The Kelly Four returned, Deasy and Henderson, with Stivers and Riggio being accompanied by bassist Don Meyer (later replaced by Dave Shriver). This was the last line-up of Cochran's touring band, returning to the name of The Kelly Four.<ref name=":3" /> [[File:C'mon, Everybody - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, December 15, 1958]]

Cochran starred in his last film ''[[Go, Johnny, Go!]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051665/ |title=Go, Johnny, Go! (1959) ⭐ 5.8 {{!}} Drama, Music, Romance |language=en-US |access-date=2024-05-24 |via=m.imdb.com}}</ref> In January 1960, Cochran recorded his last session at [[Gold Star Studios]].<ref name=":4" /> His brief music career included a few more hits, such as "[[C'mon, Everybody]]", "[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]", "[[Teenage Heaven]]", and "[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]", which posthumously topped the charts in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1960. He remained popular in the United States and United Kingdom through the late 1950s and early 1960s, and more of his records were posthumous hits, such as "My Way", "[[Weekend (Eddie Cochran song)|Weekend]]", and "Nervous Breakdown".

=== Television appearances ===
Throughout his music career, Cochran made a few television appearances. On October 22, 1957 in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], Cochran appeared on [[KPTV]]'s ''High Time'', hosted by Gene Brendler, and sang "Am I Blue?".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oregon Historical Society |date=March 24, 2018 |title=KPTV's High Time - Studio Outtakes (1958, MI# 09905) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aPORttAbs4&t=0s |access-date=May 24, 2024 |website=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.facebook.com/thewheelgrinders/videos/on-this-day-62-years-ago-october-22nd-1957-eddie-cochran-guested-on-the-kptv-tee/411485446183229/ |title=On this day 62 years ago, October 22nd 1957, Eddie Cochran guested on the KPTV teenager's music show "High Time" in Portland, Oregon.

=== Session musician and producer ===
Another aspect of Cochran's short but brilliant career is his work as a session musician and producer.<ref name="bigvjamboree" /> In 1959, Cochran played lead for [[Skeets McDonald]] at Columbia's studios for "You Oughta See Grandma Rock" and "Heart Breaking Mama". In a session for [[Gene Vincent]] in March 1958, he contributed his trademark bass voice, as heard on "Summertime Blues". The recordings were issued on the album ''A Gene Vincent Record Date''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eddiecochran.info/Sessions/IV.htm|title=Remembering Eddie Cochran|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810005803/http://www.eddiecochran.info/Sessions/IV.htm |access-date=March 4, 2024|archive-date=August 10, 2016 }}</ref>

Cochran worked mainly as a guitarist, and sometimes as a vocalist and arranger for other artists, such as [[Mamie Van Doren]], [[Baker Knight]], [[Johnny Burnette]], [[Wynn Stewart]], and [[Al Casey (rock guitarist)|Al Casey]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Eddie Cochran: In Session |url=https://propermusic.com/products/eddiecochran-insession |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=Proper Music |language=en}}</ref> 

=== The Day the Music Died (1959) ===
{{Main article|The Day the Music Died}}
In early 1959, two of Cochran's friends, [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], along with [[the Big Bopper]], were [[The Day the Music Died|killed in a plane crash]] while on tour on February 3, 1959. Cochran's friends and family later said that he was badly shaken by their deaths, and he developed a morbid premonition that he also would die young. Shortly after their deaths, Cochran recorded a song (written by disc jockey Tommy Dee) in tribute to them, "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]". He was anxious to give up life on the road and spend his time in the studio making music, thereby reducing the chance of suffering a similar fatal accident while touring. Financial responsibilities, however, required that Cochran continue to perform live, and that led to his acceptance of an offer to tour the [[United Kingdom]] in 1960.

=== United Kingdom tour (1960) ===
Organized and promoted by [[Larry Parnes]], Cochran and [[Gene Vincent]] toured the United Kingdom from January through to April 1960.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk/tour/eddie-cochran-jan-april-1960/ |title = Eddie Cochran – Jan / April 1960 « American Rock n Roll the UK Tours|website=Americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk}}</ref> On the bill, they were accompanied by British acts [[Billy Fury]], [[Joe Brown (musician)|Joe Brown]], [[Vince Eager]], and [[Tony Sheridan]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Edwardian Teddy Boy - 1960 Tour of Vincent & Cochran |url=https://www.edwardianteddyboy.com/page64.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.edwardianteddyboy.com}}</ref> At the beginning of the tour, Cochran first performed a memorable show in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]] at the cinema venue [[Regent Theatre, Ipswich|Ipswich Gaumont]]. Cochran was backed by [[Marty Wilde]]'s band The Wildcats throughout the 1960 tour, exposing the British audience to live American rock 'n' roll. [[Georgie Fame]], then a member of the Beat Boys and the backing band for Vincent, recollected, "I remember Eddie playing guitar and we were astounded."<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2022-07-05 |title=MOJO Time Machine: Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran Join First All-Star Tour |url=https://www.mojo4music.com/time-machine/1960s/mojo-time-machine-gene-vincent-and-eddie-cochran-join-first-all-star-tour/ |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=Mojo |language=en}}</ref> During the progression of the tour, Cochran's fiancé [[Sharon Sheeley]] had flown in from America and joined them in late March.

== Personal life ==
Cochran dated singer-songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]]. As a songwriter, Sheeley worked in the music business and for manager Jerry Capehart. She wrote "[[Love Again (Sharon Sheeley song)|Love Again]]" and "Cherished Memories" for Cochran, and the 1959 hit song "Somethin' Else" with Eddie's brother Bill Cochran.<ref name=":5">[[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Leigh, Spencer]] (May 19, 2002).

In 1988, [[Levi Strauss & Co.]] promoted their Levi's 501 range with a television commercial called ''Eddie Cochran'', directed by Syd Macartney.<ref name=":5" /> It told the story of how Sheeley (played by actress Sharon Devlin) attracted Cochran at the 1958 party by wearing said product. It was supposedly narrated by Sheeley. The background song, "C'mon Everybody", was released as a promotional single, followed by a compilation album of Cochran's hits.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Levi's 501 commercial (Cochran) (1988) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOCMP3H2OCc |access-date=May 29, 2024 |website=YouTube| date=January 7, 2009 }}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Eddie Cochran Memorial, Rowden Hil, Chippenham - May 2021.jpg|thumb|Eddie Cochran Memorial, Rowden Hill, Chippenham]]
On the night of April 16, 1960, Cochran and his friend and fellow performing artist, [[Gene Vincent]], had just finished performing at the last of their scheduled concerts at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]]. They were traveling along the [[A4 road (England)#Chippenham to Bath (12.7 miles)|Bath Road]] in a taxi (a cream-coloured 1960 model [[Ford Consul#Ford Consul Mark II (1956–1962)|Ford Consul Mark II]] saloon) from [[Bristol]] towards [[London]] to [[Heathrow Airport]]. In addition to Cochran and Vincent, the other passengers in the vehicle were Sharon Sheeley, Patrick Tompkins (the tour manager, 29 years old), and George Martin (the 19-year-old taxi driver). At about 11:50&nbsp;p.m. that night, Martin lost control of the vehicle, which crashed into a concrete lamppost at Rowden Hill in [[Chippenham]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Simmonds|first=Jeremy|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|chapter=Introduction|page=xii|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago|year=2008|isbn=978-1-55652-754-8}}</ref> At the moment of impact, Cochran (who was seated in the center of the back seat) threw himself over Sheeley to shield her. The force of the collision caused the left rear passenger door to open,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eddie-cochran.info/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422182106/http://www.eddie-cochran.info/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=April 22, 2006|title=Link Alternatif SBOBET|website=Eddie-cochran.info}}</ref> and Cochran was ejected from the vehicle, sustaining a massive [[traumatic brain injury]] from [[blunt force trauma]] to the skull or a [[cerebral contusion]]. The road was dry, and the weather was good, but the vehicle was later determined to be travelling at an excessive speed.<ref name=Stanton2003>{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Scott|edition=2|title=The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians|chapter=Eddie Cochran|pages=50–53|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=2003|isbn=978-0743463300}}</ref> No other vehicle was involved in the incident.<ref name=Stanton2003/>

The occupants of the vehicle were all taken to Chippenham Community Hospital and later transferred to St. Martin's Hospital in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Cochran never regained consciousness and died, aged 21, at 4:10&nbsp;p.m. the following day – Easter Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eddie-cochran.info/IMAGES/The%20Crash_files/CR_17.JPG|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140130114505/http://www.eddie-cochran.info/IMAGES/The%20Crash_files/CR_17.JPG|url-status=usurped|archive-date=January 30, 2014|title=Certified Copy of an Entry of Death: Edward Ray Cochran|publisher=County Borough of Bath|date=July 2, 1960|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Sheeley suffered injuries to her back and thigh, Vincent suffered a fractured collarbone and severe injuries to his legs, and Tompkins sustained facial injuries and a possible fracture of the base of the skull. Martin did not sustain significant injuries.

Vincent and Sheeley returned to the United States after the accident. Cochran's body was flown home, and after a funeral service was buried on April 25, at [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Cypress, California]].<ref name=Cochran2003/> In August 1960, Sheeley told ''[[Photoplay]] magazine'', that Cochran said to her on his last day, just before entering the taxi to the airport, "You know, Shari, I've got a queer feeling that Fate’s not going to let us [be together]. Something awful is going to happen— I can feel it."<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Martin was convicted of dangerous driving, fined £50 (and in default of payment six months' imprisonment), and disqualified from driving for 15 years.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Gene Vincent & Eddie Cochran|last=Collis|first=John|date=August 19, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-7535-4783-0|language=en}}</ref> His driving disqualification was lifted on May 7, 1968, after the judge at [[Bristol Crown Court|Bristol Assizes]] determined that Martin "had suffered considerable financial hardship".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000560/19680508/009/0002?browse=False|title=15-year ban on driver lifted|access-date=February 26, 2020|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|page=2|date=May 8, 1968}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The car and other items from the crash were impounded at the local police station until a coroner's inquest could be held.

While they were preparing to board their taxi, Vincent and Cochran rebuffed musician [[Tony Sheridan]]'s request to ride along with them, resulting in Sheridan's avoiding involvement in the accident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/radio/doconone/771586-are-you-tony-sheridan|title=Are you Tony Sheridan?|date=February 29, 2016|website=Rte.ie}}</ref>

== Legacy ==

=== Posthumous releases and honors ===
A posthumous album, ''[[My Way (Eddie Cochran album)|My Way]]'', was released in 1964. Cochran was a prolific performer, and the British label Rockstar Records has released more of his music posthumously than was released during his life. The company is still looking for unpublished songs. One of his posthumous releases was "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]", a tribute to J.P. Richardson, better known as [[the Big Bopper]], and Cochran's friends [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], who had all [[The Day the Music Died|died in a plane crash]] just one year earlier. Written just hours after the tragedy by disc jockey Tommy Dee, it was recorded by Cochran two days later (Dee recorded his own version several weeks later). His voice broke during the spoken lyrics about Valens and Holly.

In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=RRHOF/> His pioneering contribution to the genre of rockabilly has also been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. Several of his songs have been re-released since his death, such as "C'mon Everybody", which was a number 14 hit in 1988 in the UK. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked him number 84 on its 2003 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

On September 27, 2010, the mayor of [[Bell Gardens, California]], declared October 3, 2010, to be "Eddie Cochran Day" to celebrate the famous musician who began his career when living in that city.

On June 10, 2022, Cochran's hometown of [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]] renamed James Street to Eddie Cochran Street in his honor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Leddy |first=Darian |date=June 10, 2022 |title=Albert Lea street renamed to honor musician Eddie Cochran |url=https://www.kttc.com/2022/06/10/albert-lea-street-renamed-honor-musican-eddie-cochran/ |website=[[KTTC]]}}</ref>

==Style and influence==
Cochran was one of the first rock-and-roll artists to write his own songs and overdub tracks. He is also credited with being one of the first to use an unwound third string to "bend" notes up a whole tone—an innovation (imparted to UK guitarist Joe Brown, who secured much session work as a result) that has since become an essential part of the standard rock guitar vocabulary.

It was because [[Paul McCartney]] knew the chords and words to "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" that he became a member of [[the Beatles]]. On July 6, 1957, McCartney met [[John Lennon]] at the [[St Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool|St. Peter's Church]] and performed a few songs for him, including Cochran's "Twenty Flight Rock". Lennon was so impressed that he invited McCartney to play in his band, [[the Quarrymen]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eh8BedNtLgC |title=Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now |date=1998-10-15 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-8050-5249-7 |pages=26 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] was heavily influenced by Cochran's guitar style ("Summertime Blues" was a staple of live performances by the Who for most of their career, until the death of bassist and vocalist [[John Entwistle]] in 2002, and is featured on their album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'').<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sexton |first=Paul |date=2023-07-11 |title=The Who's 'Summertime Blues': An Eddie Cochran Tribute, Live At Leeds |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-who-summertime-blues-song/ |access-date=2024-05-25 |website=uDiscover Music |language=en-US}}</ref> [[San Francisco Sound]] band [[Blue Cheer]]'s version of "Summertime Blues" was their only hit and signature song, and has been described as the first [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] song.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=George-Warren|editor1-first=Holly|editor2-last=Romanowski|editor2-first=Patricia|title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bluecheer/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020|year=2001|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0743292016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202120229/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bluecheer/biography|archive-date=December 2, 2008}}</ref>

'''Elvis Aaron Presley'''{{efn|name=name|Although some pronounce his surname {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɛ|z|l|i}} {{respell|PREZ|lee}}, Presley himself pronounced it {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɛ|s|l|i}} {{respell|PRESS|lee}}, as did his family and those who worked with him.{{sfn|Elster|2006|p=391}}<p>The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate. The physician who delivered him wrote "Elvis Aaron Presley" in his ledger.{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} The state-issued birth certificate reads "Elvis Aron Presley". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, "especially on legal documents".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as official.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}}}} (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), known [[Mononym|mononymously]] as '''Elvis''', was an American singer and actor. Known as the "'''King of Rock and Roll'''", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[civil rights movement|transformative era in race relations]], brought both great success and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley#Danger to American culture|initial controversy]].

Presley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]; his family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed him for the rest of his life. Presley's first RCA Victor single, "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular [[rock and roll]]; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans<ref name=":00" /> led to him being widely considered a [[moral panic|threat]] to the moral well-being of [[White Americans|white American]] youth.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=55}}

In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into [[Military career of Elvis Presley|military service in 1958]], he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.

Presley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time, with sales estimated around 500&nbsp;million records worldwide.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales}} He was commercially successful in many genres, including [[Traditional pop|pop]], country, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, [[adult contemporary]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. He won three [[Grammy Awards]], received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]]. He holds several records, including the most [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and the most number-one singles by any act on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], to Gladys Love ({{née|Smith}}) and Vernon Presley.{{sfn|Eames|2022a}}{{sfn|Eames|2022b}} Elvis' twin Jesse Garon was delivered 35 minutes before, [[Stillbirth|stillborn]].{{sfn|Earl|2017}} Presley became close to both parents, especially his mother. The family attended an [[Assembly of God]] church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}} Vernon moved from one [[Handyman|odd job]] to the next,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11–12, 23–24}}{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=419}} and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of [[Cheque fraud|altering a check]] and was jailed for eight months.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12–14}}

In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as "average".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=15–16}} His first public performance was a singing contest at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang "Old Shep" and recalled placing fifth.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=17–18}} A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday;{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=19}}{{sfn|Dundy|2004|p=101}} he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very [[shyness|shy]] about it."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}

In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a "trashy" kid who played [[hillbilly music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23–26}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s radio show. He was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates. Slim showed Presley chord techniques.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=19–21}} When his [[Mentorship|protégé]] was 12, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=95–96}}

In November 1948, the family moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=32–33}} Enrolled at [[Humes Preparatory Academy Middle School|L. C. Humes High School]], Presley received a C in [[Music education|music]] in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=36}} He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally [[bullying|bullied]] by classmates for being a "[[mama's boy]]".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=35–38}} In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of [[Lee Denson]], a neighbor. They and three other boys, including two future [[rockabilly]] pioneers, brothers [[Dorsey Burnette|Dorsey]] and [[Johnny Burnette]]—formed a loose musical collective.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=40–41}}

During his junior year, Presley began to stand out among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his [[sideburns]] and styled his hair. He would head down to [[Beale Street]], the heart of Memphis' thriving [[blues]] scene, and admire the wild, flashy clothes at [[Lansky Brothers]]. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} He competed in Humes' Annual "Minstrel" Show in 1953, singing and playing "[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: <blockquote>I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show&nbsp;... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=52–53}}</blockquote>

Presley, who could not [[Musical notation|read music]], played by ear and frequented record stores that provided [[jukebox]]es and listening booths. He knew all of [[Hank Snow]]'s songs,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} and he loved records by other country singers such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis]], and [[Bob Wills]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his [[ballad]]-singing style.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46–48, 358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48, 77–78}} Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as [[WDIA]], that played what were then called "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-heavy [[rhythm and blues]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=38–40}} Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights [[Racial segregation in the United States|designated for exclusively white audiences]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} Many of his future recordings were inspired by local [[African-American music]]ians such as [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus Thomas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=205}} [[B.B.

=== 1953–1956: first recordings ===
==== Sam Phillips and Sun Records ====

[[File:PresleyPromo1954PhotoOnly.jpg|alt=Elvis in a tuxedo|thumb|left|Presley in a [[Sun Records]] promotional photograph, 1954|upright=1.0]]
In August 1953, Presley checked into [[Sun Studio|Memphis Recording Service]], the company run by [[Sam Phillips]] before he started [[Sun Records]]. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: "[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]" and "[[That's When Your Heartaches Begin]]". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he "sounded like". Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62–64}} In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun—"I'll Never Stand in Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an [[audition]] for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} and another for the band of [[Eddie Bond]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}
{{Listen|type=speech|filename=That's All Right.ogg|title="That's All Right" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a "lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence."{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}
Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield "Scotty" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10–11}} The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "[[That's All Right]]". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them." Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94–97}} Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey [[Dewey Phillips]] (no relation to Sam Phillips) played "That's All Right" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–101}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song, [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury-rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A-side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102–104}}

==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====
The trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} Later that month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. Here Elvis pioneered "[[Rubber legs|Rubber Legs]]", his signature dance movement.{{sfn|Miller|2021}}{{sfn|Rodman|2013|p=151}} A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108–111}} Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}

Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]] became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house [[western swing]] band resumed.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=139}} Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117–127, 131}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on October 2; ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128–130}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37–38}}

==== ''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances ====
In November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''—the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127–128, 135–142}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175 ({{Inflation|US|175|1954|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) and his trio began playing in new locales, including [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}} Presley made his first television appearance on the [[KSLA-TV]] broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167–168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6–12}}
[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, September 1956 01.jpg|thumb|230px|Presley performing with [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] in 1956]]
In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed the top country star [[Eddy Arnold]], Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, [[Hank Snow]]. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167–168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6–12}}

By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a [[hillbilly]]."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as "rockabilly". At the time, Presley was billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}

Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him."{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217–219}}

At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28–29}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28–29}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary [[royalty payment|royalties]] in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=36, 54}}{{refn|In 1956–57, Presley was also credited as a co-writer on several songs where he had no hand in the writing process: "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]"; "[[Don't Be Cruel]]"; all four songs from his first film, including the title track, "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]"; "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]"; and "[[All Shook Up]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=35, 51, 57, 61, 75}} (Parker, however, failed to register Presley with such musical licensing firms as [[ASCAP]] and its rival [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], which eventually denied Presley annuity from songwriter's royalties.) Presley received credit on two other songs to which he did contribute: he provided the title for "[[That's Someone You Never Forget]]" (1961), written by his friend and former Humes schoolmate [[Red West]]; they collaborated with another friend, guitarist Charlie Hodge, on "[[You'll Be Gone]]" (1962).{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=157–158, 166, 168}}|name=cowriter|group=lower-alpha}} By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=29}}

=== 1956–1958: commercial breakout and controversy ===
==== First national TV appearances and debut album ====
[[File:Elvis Presley- Billboard ad 1956.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine advertisement, March 10, 1956]]
On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA Victor in Nashville.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} Extending his by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and ''Hayride'' pianist [[Floyd Cramer]]—who had been performing at live club dates with Presley—RCA Victor enlisted guitarist [[Chet Atkins]] and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular [[Jordanaires]] quartet.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=235–136}} The session produced the moody "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", released as a single on January 27.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} Parker brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'' for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]". In February, Presley's "[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}

RCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs, a bouncy pop tune, and what would centrally define the evolving sound of [[rock and roll]]: "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic [[Robert Hilburn]]—and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire, covers of [[Little Richard]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[The Drifters]]. As described by Hilburn, these <blockquote>were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}}</blockquote> It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for ten weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music."{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}

==== ''Milton Berle Show'' and "Hound Dog" ====
[[File:Elvis signs autographs in Minneapolis 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Presley signing autographs in [[Minneapolis]] in 1956]]
On April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''. His performance, on the deck of the [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS ''Hancock'']] in [[San Diego]], California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=262–263}} A few days later, Presley and his band were flying to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over [[Arkansas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=267}} Twelve weeks after its original release, "Heartbreak Hotel" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week [[concert residency|residency]] at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].{{sfn|Koch |Manning |Toplikar |2008}} The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests, "like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party", a ''[[Newsweek]]'' critic wrote.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=274}} Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} He began a tour of the [[American Midwest|Midwest]] in mid-May, covering fifteen cities in as many days.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=72–73}} He had attended several shows by [[Freddie Bell and the Bellboys]] in Vegas and was struck by their cover of "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]", a hit in 1953 for blues singer [[Big Mama Thornton]] by songwriters [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. It became his new closing number.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=273, 284}}

After a show in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. It warned that <blockquote>Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States.&nbsp;... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.&nbsp;... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium.&nbsp;... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls&nbsp;... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph.{{sfn|Fensch|2001|pp=14–18}}</blockquote>

Presley's second ''Milton Berle Show'' appearance came on June 5 at [[NBC]]'s Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. [[Milton Berle]] persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an up-tempo rendition of "Hound Dog" and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements.{{sfn|Burke|Griffin|2006|p=52}} His gyrations created a storm of controversy.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=49}} [[Jack Gould]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, <blockquote>Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.&nbsp;... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.&nbsp;... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body&nbsp;... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.{{sfn|Gould|1956}}</blockquote> Ben Gross of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.&nbsp;... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis&nbsp;... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and [[bordello]]s".{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}} [[Ed Sullivan]], whose [[The Ed Sullivan Show|variety show]] was the nation's most popular, declared Presley "unfit for family viewing".{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "childish".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=100}}

==== ''Steve Allen Show'' and first Sullivan appearance ====
[[File:Elvis Presley and Ed Sullivan October 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Photo of Elvis and Ed Sullivan|[[Ed Sullivan]] and Presley during rehearsals for his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', October 26, 1956]]
The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in New York. [[Steve Allen|Allen]], no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white bowtie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a [[basset hound]] wearing a top hat and bowtie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd&nbsp;... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition".{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=13}} Allen later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" and worked him into the "comedy fabric" of his program.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=270}} Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, "I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance."{{sfn|Rock 'N Roll Stars|1956|p=5}} Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=73}} Later that night, he appeared on ''[[Hy Gardner Calling]]'', a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him, Presley responded, "No, I haven't... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.&nbsp;... how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?"{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=73}}

The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", "[[Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be)|Any Way You Want Me]]" and "[[Don't Be Cruel]]". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on ''The Steve Allen Show''; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=51}} In August, a judge in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=80–81}} The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for thirty-six years.{{sfn|Whitburn|1993|p=5}} Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood in early September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog", contributed "[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=60–65}}

Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in the ratings. Sullivan booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.{{sfn|Edgerton|2007|p=187}} Actor [[Charles Laughton]] hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} According to legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows, Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock.&nbsp;... I think it's a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] bottle.&nbsp;... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=93}} Sullivan publicly told ''[[TV Guide]]'', "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots."{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=16}} In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=338}}{{sfn|Gibson|2005}} Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}} More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' that made Presley a national celebrity.{{sfn|Marcus|2006}}

Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the "biggest pop craze" since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp; and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: <blockquote>As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.{{sfn|Jezer|1982|p=281}}</blockquote>

==== Crazed crowds and film debut ====
[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, March 1957 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Elvis performing on stage|Presley performing live at the Mississippi-Alabama Fairgrounds in Tupelo, September 26, 1956]]

The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."{{sfn|Moore|Dickerson|1997|p=175}} At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=343}} ''[[Elvis (1956 album)|Elvis]]'', Presley's second RCA Victor album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick, "the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm" showed "the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=335}} Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through ''Elvis'', rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=395}}

{{Listen|filename=Hound Dog & intro (live-Ed Sullivan 2).ogg|title="We're gonna do a sad song&nbsp;..." |description=Presley's definition of rock and roll included a sense of humor—here, during his second Sullivan appearance, he introduces one of his signature numbers.}}
Presley returned to ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] burned him in [[effigy]].{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} His first motion picture, ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original title—''[[Reno Gang|The Reno Brothers]]''—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=315}} Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.{{sfn|O'Malley|2016}}

On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] were recording, and had an impromptu [[jam session]] along with [[Johnny Cash]]. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the "[[Million Dollar Quartet]]" recordings.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=71}} The year ended with a front-page story in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22&nbsp;million on top of his record sales,{{sfn|Palladino|1996|p=131}} and ''Billboard''{{'}}s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=37}} In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=439}}

==== Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice ====
Presley made his third and final ''Ed Sullivan Show'' appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.{{sfn|Gibson|2005}}{{sfn|Clayton|Heard|2003|pp=117–118}} In any event, as critic [[Greil Marcus]] describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a [[pasha]], if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', with all stops out."{{sfn|Marcus|2006}} To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, "[[Peace in the Valley]]". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy".{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=90}} Two days later, the Memphis [[Conscription in the United States|draft board]] announced that Presley would be [[class 1-A|classified 1-A]] and would probably be drafted sometime that year.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=95}}

Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "[[Too Much (Elvis Presley song)|Too Much]]", "[[All Shook Up]]", and "[[(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released: ''The New York Times'' reported that pressings of his music on [[Ribs (recordings)|discarded X-ray plates]] were commanding high prices in [[Leningrad]].{{sfn|Salisbury|1957|p=4}} Presley purchased his 18-room mansion, [[Graceland]], on March 19, 1957.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=395–397}} Before the purchase, Elvis recorded ''[[Loving You (soundtrack)|Loving You]]''—the soundtrack to [[Loving You (1957 film)|his second film]], which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the ''Jailhouse'' sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck charm".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=406–408, 452}} "He was fast," said Leiber. "Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=178}} The [[Jailhouse Rock (song)|title track]] became another [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|number-one hit]], as was the [[Jailhouse Rock (EP)|''Jailhouse Rock'' EP]].{{sfn|Leigh|2017|p=187}}

Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=399–402, 428–430, 437–440}} A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} [[Villanova University|Villanova]] students pelted the singer with eggs in [[Philadelphia]],{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=400}} and in [[Vancouver]] the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}} Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.&nbsp;... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.&nbsp;... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=104}} Asked for a response, Presley said: <blockquote>I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=437}}</blockquote>

Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of ''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]''. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: "[[Santa Claus Is Back in Town]]", an [[innuendo]]-laden blues.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=431}} The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the [[List of best-selling Christmas albums in the United States|best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States]],{{sfn|Grein|2008}}{{sfn|Caulfield|2016}} with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide.{{sfn|Baird|2017}} After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned, though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=431–435}}

On December 20, Presley received his draft notice, though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film ''[[King Creole]]''. A couple of weeks into the new year, "[[Don't (Elvis Presley song)|Don't]]", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number-one seller. Recording sessions for the [[King Creole (soundtrack)|''King Creole'' soundtrack]] were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=448–449}} As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off.{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=99, 105}}

On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the [[United States Army]] at [[Fort Chaffee Maneuver Training Center|Fort Chaffee]] in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers accompanied him into the installation.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=461–474}} Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else.{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=27}}

While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to [[amphetamines]] and became "practically evangelical about their benefits", not only for energy but for "strength" and weight loss.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=21}} Karate became a lifelong interest: he studied with [[Jürgen Seydel]],{{sfn|Tillery|2013|p=60}}{{sfn|Eiland|2018}} and later included it in his live performances.{{sfn|Corcoran|1998}}{{sfn|Tillery|2013|loc=Chapter 5: Patriot}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=47, 49, 55, 60, 73}} Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity.

In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career. In [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]], he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve as a regular soldier.{{sfn|Presley|1985|p=40}} Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA Victor producer [[Stephen H.

Elvis' singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic."{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=279–280}} The record "conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things", according to music historian John Robertson: "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=50}} Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.{{sfn|"Red Carpet"|1960}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=124–127, 414}}

[[File:Juliet Prowse-Elvis Presley in G.I. Blues.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Presley with [[Juliet Prowse]] in ''[[G.I. Blues]]'']]
Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis|The Frank Sinatra Timex Special]]''. Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62–63}}

''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I. Blues]]'', the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'', followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely "a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}

==== Lost in Hollywood ====
Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted [[musical comedy|musical comedies]]. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein—''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a "pantheon of bad taste".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine, declared, "A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood."{{sfn|Fields|2007}}

Of Presley's films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—Presley frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: "three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew "progressively worse".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}}
[[File:Elvis Presley and Priscilla with Lisa Marie February 1968.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Presley and his wife, [[Priscilla Presley]], holding their newborn daughter, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in 1968]]
In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]" (1961) and "[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: "[[Crying in the Chapel]]" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was "arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}

Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261–263}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. "By then, of course, the damage had been done", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. "Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans."{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}

Presley's only child, [[Lisa Marie Presley|Lisa Marie]], was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=171}} Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, none higher than number 28.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=521}} His forthcoming soundtrack album, ''[[Speedway (album)|Speedway]]'', would rank at number 82. Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}

Recorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, simply called ''Elvis'', aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked: <blockquote>There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}}</blockquote> Marsh calls the performance one of "emotional grandeur and historical resonance".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}

By January 1969, the single "[[If I Can Dream]]", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what "he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man."{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.{{'"}}{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}}

Buoyed by the experience of the ''Comeback Special'', Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at [[American Sound Studio]], which led to the acclaimed ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]''. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is "a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement."{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single "[[In the Ghetto]]", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since "Bossa Nova Baby" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: "[[Suspicious Minds]]", "[[Don't Cry Daddy]]", and "[[Kentucky Rain]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=419}}

Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the ''Comeback Special'', offers came in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker {{US$|28,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|28000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for a one-week engagement. He responded, "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand-new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Costume designer [[Bill Belew]], responsible for the intense leather styling of the ''Comeback Special'', created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=343}} Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346–347}}

Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, "Can't Help Falling in Love" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149–150}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as "The King", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. "No," Presley said, "that's the real king of rock and roll."{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''[[Newsweek]]'' commented, "There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars."{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley "supernatural, his own resurrection."{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis]]'' came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. "Suspicious Minds" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop number-one]] in over seven years, and his last.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|pp=521–522}}

[[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas. She recalled of their encounter, "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked [[marijuana]], and he was just appalled."{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley also rarely drank—several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.{{sfn|Mason|2007|p=81}}

==== Back on tour and meeting Nixon ====

Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album ''[[On Stage (Elvis Presley album)|On Stage]]''.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=94}} In late February, Presley performed six attendance-record–breaking shows at the [[Houston Astrodome]].{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=95}} In April, the single "[[The Wonder of You#Elvis Presley version|The Wonder of You]]" was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary]] chart as well. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|50000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a [[Derringer]] in his right boot and a [[.45 caliber]] [[pistol]] in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=96}}

''[[That's the Way It Is (Elvis Presley album)|That's the Way It Is]]'', produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, <blockquote>The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}}</blockquote> After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the [[Southern United States|South]], his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], followed in November.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=99}}

On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]], where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the [[hippie]]s to help combat the [[drug culture]] he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge, to signify official sanction of his efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he "retain his credibility".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=419–422}} Presley told Nixon that [[the Beatles]], whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era,{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=284, 286, 307–308, 313, 326, 338, 357–358}} exemplified what he saw as a trend of [[anti-Americanism]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=420}} Presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the Beatles at his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air, California]], in August 1965. [[Paul McCartney]] later said that he "felt a bit betrayed.&nbsp;... The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's early death linked to [[prescription drug abuse]].{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=192}}

The [[United States Junior Chamber|U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce]] named Presley one of its annual [[Ten Outstanding Young Americans|Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation]] on January 16, 1971.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=321}} Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of [[U.S. Route 51|Highway 51 South]] on which Graceland is located "Elvis Presley Boulevard". The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] (then known as the Bing Crosby Award).{{sfn|McPhate|2017}}{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=299–300}} Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was ''[[Elvis Country]]'', a [[Concept album|concept record]] that focused on genre standards.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=319}} The biggest seller was ''[[Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas]]''. According to Greil Marcus, <blockquote>In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of "[[Merry Christmas Baby]]", a raunchy old [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]] blues.{{nbsp}}[...] If [Presley's] sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=284–185}}</blockquote>

MGM filmed Presley in April 1972 for ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'', which went on to win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film]] for [[30th Golden Globe Awards|that year's Golden Globe Awards]]. His gospel album ''[[He Touched Me (album)|He Touched Me]]'', released that month, would earn him his second [[Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance]]. A fourteen-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=308}} The evening concert on July 10 was issued in LP form a week later. ''[[Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden]]'' became one of Presley's biggest-selling albums. After the tour, the single "[[Burning Love]]" was released—Presley's last top ten hit on the U.S. pop chart. "The most exciting single Elvis has made since 'All Shook Up{{'"}}, wrote rock critic [[Robert Christgau]].{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=283}}
[[File:Elvis and Priscilla Presley after divorce hearing.jpg|left|thumb|259x259px|Elvis and [[Priscilla Presley]] after their divorce was finalized in 1973]]
Presley and his wife had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had with Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion.{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=253–254}} He often raised the possibility of Joyce moving into Graceland.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=451, 446, 453}} The Presleys [[marital separation|separated]] on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with [[Mike Stone (karate)|Mike Stone]], a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her.

Presley replied, "Well, the image is one thing and the human being another&nbsp;... it's very hard to live up to an image."{{sfn|Keogh|2004|pp=234–235}}

In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the [[Kui Lee]] Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]'', which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, ''Aloha from Hawaii'' aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan, where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week, it smashed viewing records. The next night, it was simulcast to twenty-eight European countries, and in April an extended version aired in the U.S., receiving a fifty-seven percent share of the TV audience.{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|pp=61, 67, 73}} Over time, Parker's claim that it was seen by one billion or more people{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=73}} would be broadly accepted,{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=364}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=475}} but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention.{{sfn|Fessier|2013}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sun |first=Bruce Fessier |title=Director remembers landmark Elvis Presley performance |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/05/10/elvis-presley-aloha-from-hawaii/2151617/ |access-date=2024-08-12 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US |quote=Those figures now seem dubious.

At a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presley's defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, Presley raged, "There's too much pain in me&nbsp;... Stone [must] die." His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, [[Red West]], his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a [[contract killing]] and was relieved when Presley decided, "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=488–490}}

=== 1973–1977: health deterioration and death ===
==== Medical crises and last studio sessions ====
Presley's divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=329}} By then, his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his primary care physician, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley "felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519–520}}

Presley's condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] remembered his arrival at a [[University of Maryland]] concert: "He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, 'Is the tour gonna happen'?"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=547}} Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled: <blockquote>He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.&nbsp;... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.&nbsp;... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions.{{sfn|Hopkins|1986|p=136}}</blockquote>

RCA began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=560}} Parker delivered RCA another concert record, ''[[Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis]]''.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=336}} Recorded on March 20, it included a version of "[[How Great Thou Art]]" that won Presley his third and final [[Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=381}}{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} All three of his competitive Grammy wins{{snd}}out of fourteen total nominations{{snd}}were for gospel recordings.{{sfn|Grammy|2014}} Presley returned to the recording studio in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=584–585}} In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=593–595}} However, the recording process had become a struggle for him.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=595}}

==== Final months ====

After Presley's relationship with Linda Thompson ended,{{sfn|Gostin|2023}} he began dating Ginger Alden in November 1976; he proposed marriage to Alden two months later.{{sfn|Speakman|2023}}

Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that, by early 1977, "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts."{{sfn|Scherman|2006}} According to Andy Greene of ''Rolling Stone'', Presley's final performances were mostly "sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch."{{sfn|Greene|2018}} In [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], he was on stage for less than an hour and "was impossible to understand".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=628}} On March 31, he canceled a performance in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=628–630}}

Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualism]] books".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=634}} Presley's cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite [[Monty Python]] sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=212, 642}}

"[[Way Down]]", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, was released on June 6, 1977. That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special, ''[[Elvis in Concert]]'', to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Two days later, in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], South Dakota, "he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was "framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=638}} Presley's final concert was held in [[Indianapolis]] at [[Market Square Arena]], on June 26, 1977.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=23}}

On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to [[Portland, Maine]], to begin another tour. That afternoon, however, his fiancée Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion.{{sfn|Alden|2014}} Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at [[Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis|Baptist Memorial Hospital]] at 3:30&nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=645–648}} He was 42.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=242}}

President [[Jimmy Carter]] issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of American popular culture".{{sfn|Woolley|Peters|1977}} Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted {{US$|18000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|18000|1977|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the ''[[National Enquirer]]''{{'}}s biggest-selling issue ever.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=386}} Alden struck a $105,000 ({{Inflation|US|105000|1977|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) deal with the ''Enquirer'' for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=660}} Presley left her nothing in his [[will and testament|will]].{{sfn|Victor|2008|pp=581–582}}

Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on August 18. Outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third.{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=26}} About 80,000 people lined the processional route to [[Forest Hill Cemetery (Memphis, Tennessee)|Forest Hill Cemetery]], where Presley was buried next to his mother.{{sfn|Pendergast|Pendergast|2000|p=108}} Within a few weeks, "Way Down" topped the country and UK singles chart.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}}{{sfn|Warwick|Kutner|Brown|2004|pp=860–866}} Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=660}}

=== Cause of death ===
While an [[autopsy]] undertaken the same day Presley died was still in progress, Memphis [[Coroner|medical examiner]] Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that "drugs played no role in Presley's death".{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} In fact, "drug use was heavily implicated" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered "[[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported "fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651–653}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of [[depressant]]s had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: "Elvis had  an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call."{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}}

The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was [[cardiac arrhythmia]], a condition that can be determined only in a living person; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.{{sfn|Baden|Hennessee|1990|p=35}} While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, George C. Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability, the facts were startling: "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of [[sedative]]s, [[amphetamine]]s, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name." Nichopoulos' license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}

In 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack."{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then."{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11–14}} One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, <blockquote>could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with [[diabetes]], glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and [[methadone]] treatments.{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11–14}}</blockquote>

=== Later developments ===
Between 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.{{sfn|Whitburn|2006|p=273}} Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=433}} The residence was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2006.{{sfn|National Park Service|2010}}

Presley has been inducted into five music [[Hall of fame|halls of fame]]: the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1986), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1998), the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2001), the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] (2007), and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] (2012). In 1984, he received the [[Blues Music Award|W. C. Handy Award]] from the [[Blues Foundation]] and the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the [[American Music Award]]s' Award of Merit.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=33}}

A [[Tom Holkenborg|Junkie XL]] remix of Presley's "[[A Little Less Conversation]]" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") was used in a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertising campaign during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's number-one hits, ''[[ELV1S]]'', which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the ''Billboard'' chart for the first time in almost three decades.{{sfn|Garrity|2002}}

In 2003, a remix of "[[Rubberneckin']]", a 1969 recording, topped the U.S. sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of "That's All Right" the following year.{{sfn|Bronson|2004|p=1}} The latter was an outright hit in Britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in Canada.{{sfn|"Hits of the World"|2004}} In 2005, another three reissued singles, "Jailhouse Rock", "One Night"/"I Got Stung", and "It's Now or Never", went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all eighteen of Presley's previous chart-topping UK singles. The first, "All Shook Up", came with a collectors' box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top five.{{sfn|Sexton|2007}}

In 2005, [[Forbes (magazine)|''Forbes'' magazine]] named Presley the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid dead celebrity|top-earning deceased celebrity]] for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of $45&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Goldman|Ewalt|2007}} He was placed second in 2006,{{sfn|Rose|2006}} returned to the top spot the next two years,{{sfn|Goldman|Paine|2007}}{{sfn|Hoy|2008}} and ranked fourth in 2009.{{sfn|Pomerantz et al.|2009}} The following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income ever—$60&nbsp;million—spurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s ''[[Viva Elvis]]'' show in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Rose et al.|2010}} In November 2010, ''[[Viva Elvis (album)|Viva Elvis: The Album]]'' was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks.{{sfn|Baillie|2010}}{{sfn|Bouchard|2010}} As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products,{{sfn|Lynch|2011}} and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity.{{sfn|Pomerantz|2011}} Six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of $35&nbsp;million, up $8&nbsp;million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, Elvis Presley's Memphis, and hotel, The Guest House at Graceland.{{sfn|Greenburg|2017}}

In 2018, RCA/[[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]] released ''[[Where No One Stands Alone (album)|Elvis Presley – Where No One Stands Alone]]'', a new album focused on Presley' love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and [[Andy Childs]], the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album's title track.{{sfn|Legacy|2018}}

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Presley's earliest musical influence came from [[gospel music|gospel]]. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, "he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=14}} In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the [[Ellis Auditorium]], where groups such as the [[The Statesmen Quartet|Statesmen Quartet]] led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:

{{blockquote|The Statesmen were an electric combination&nbsp;... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world&nbsp;... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's.&nbsp;... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. "He went about as far as you could go in gospel music," said [[Jake Hess]]. "The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows." Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements&nbsp;... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48}}}}

[[Early life of Elvis Presley#Teenage life in Memphis|As a teenager]], Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, "He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music."{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, "I know practically every religious song that's ever been written."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}

=== Musicianship ===
Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.{{sfn|Graceland Blog|2015}} Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums. Presley played piano on songs such as "[[Old Shep]]" and "First in Line" from his 1956 album ''[[Elvis (1956 album)|Elvis]]''.{{sfn|Osborne|2017|p=[{{GBurl|id=CE6JPQyNKawC|p=73}} 73]}} He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' and "[[Moody Blue (Elvis song)|Moody Blue]]", and on "[[Unchained Melody]]", which was one of the last songs that he recorded.{{sfn|Duffett|2018|p=[{{GBurl|id=a7hJDwAAQBAJ|p=189}} 189]}} Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight]]".{{sfn|Murray|1961|p=65}} At one point during the [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]], Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as "[[Baby What You Want Me to Do]]" and "[[One Night (Elvis Presley song)|One Night]]".{{sfn|Marcus|2015|p=[{{GBurl|id=trEBDAAAQBAJ|p=341}} 341]}} The album ''[[Elvis is Back!]]'' features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as "[[I Will Be Home Again]]" and "[[Like a Baby]]".{{sfn|Eder|2013|p=[{{GBurl|id=XcYIAgAAQBAJ|pg=PT149}} 149]}}

=== Musical styles and genres ===
[[File:Elvis Presley and the Jordanaires 1957.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis and the Jordanaires|Presley with his longtime vocal backup group, the [[Jordanaires]], March 1957]]
Presley was a central figure in the development of [[rockabilly]], according to music historians. "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label," writes Craig Morrison.{{sfn|Morrison|1996|p=x}} Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as "essentially&nbsp;... an Elvis Presley construction", with the defining elements as "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} In "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, "a combination of [[Merle Travis]]–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion".{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} While Katherine Charlton calls Presley "rockabilly's originator",{{sfn|Charlton|2006|p=103}} [[Carl Perkins]], another pioneer of rock'n'roll, said that "[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly".{{sfn|Jancik|1998|p=16}} According to [[Michael Campbell (pianist and author)|Michael Campbell]], the first major rockabilly song was recorded by [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]].{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=161}} In Moore's view, "It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old."{{sfn|Guralnick|1989|p=104}}

At RCA Victor, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars,{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense manner.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=39}} While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard "[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]" at Sun Records to the country ballad "How's the World Treating You?" on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of "Santa Claus Is Back in Town". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Run On.ogg|title="Run On" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition. The arrangement evokes "the percussive style of the 1930s [[Golden Gate Quartet]]."{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=22}}{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=184}}}}
After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five "[[She's Not You]]" (1962) "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as "[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]" and "[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number-one in 1960. "It's Now or Never", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song "{{lang|nap|[['O sole mio]]|italic=no}}" and concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142–143}}

While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become "hard to find".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis in Memphis'', as well as "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}

=== Vocal style and range ===
[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the [[CBS]] program ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'', January 16, 1956]]

The developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from "high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months."{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the "vocal stutter" on 1955's "[[Baby Let's Play House]]".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on "Don't Be Cruel", Presley "slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses," he shows "how masterful his relaxed style really is."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on "Can't Help Falling in Love" as one of "gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing", with the line {{"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}

Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions", as Presley "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax", becoming "a kind of one-man quartet".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds "[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand by Me]]" from the same gospel sessions "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on "Where No One Stands Alone", resorting "to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: "The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}

Marsh praises his 1968 reading of "[[U.S. Male]]", "bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records."{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on "In the Ghetto" is, according to Jorgensen, "devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms", instead relying on the exceptional "clarity and sensitivity of his voice".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of "almost translucent eloquence&nbsp;... so quietly confident in its simplicity".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On "Suspicious Minds", Guralnick hears essentially the same "remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise", but supplemented with "an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}

Music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that "Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, "from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down."{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was "variable and unpredictable" at the bottom, "often brilliant" at the top, with the capacity for "full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all."{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}

When Dewey Phillips first aired "That's All Right" on Memphis' [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100–101}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]—the originator of "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw."{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley "cracked Memphis' segregation laws" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its "colored night".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex."<ref name=":00" />

Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." A journalist with the national African American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''Jailhouse Rock'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: <blockquote>I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.{{sfn|Williams|2012}}</blockquote> Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest."{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}

The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had "stolen" black music still found adherents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ushe |first1=Naledi |title=Appropriation or appreciation?

Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that]."{{sfn|Osborne|2000|p=207}} Nine years earlier, he had said, "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues."{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=198}}

Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", according to critic [[Mark Feeney]].{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} Television director Steve Binder reported, "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence."{{sfn|Ashley|2009|p=76}} His performance style was equally responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Critic [[George Melly]] described him as "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=58}} In his Presley obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him with bringing "overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America".{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58–59}} Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.{{sfn|Garber|1997|p=366}}

While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, ''[[Sight and Sound]]''{{'}}s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as "aggressively bisexual in appeal".{{Sfn|Dyer|1959–1960|p=30}} Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the title dance sequence in ''Jailhouse Rock'' within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image".{{sfn|Farmer|2000|p=86}} In the analysis of [[Yvonne Tasker]], "Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display."{{sfn|Tasker|2007|p=208}}

Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with Hollywood stars and starlets, from [[Natalie Wood]] in the 1950s to [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1960s to [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Cybill Shepherd]] in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.{{sfn|Stein|1997}} Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=109}}

Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.{{sfn|Collins|2002}} As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.{{sfn|Sadie|1994|p=638}} With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=94}}

For much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the [[American Dream]].{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=xv}}{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=149}} In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony.{{sfn|Cosby|2016|p=144}}{{sfn|Doll|2016|p=186}} Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy [[Southern cooking]] of his upbringing, foods such as [[chicken-fried steak]] and [[biscuits and gravy]].{{sfn|Martin|2000}}{{sfn|Smith|2002}} In particular, his love of fried [[peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich|peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches]],{{sfn|Dundy|2004|pp=227, 256}}{{sfn|Martin|2000}} now known as "Elvis sandwiches",{{sfn|Wilson|2010|p=121}} came to symbolize this characteristic.{{sfn|Slater|2002}}

Since 1977, there have been numerous [[Elvis sightings|alleged sightings of Presley]]. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death.{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=42, 157–160, 169}}{{sfn|Clarke|2006|pp=77, 80}} Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.{{sfn|Harrison|1992|pp=159–160}} An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly.{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=10}} On the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual.{{sfn|Segré|2002}} "With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death", writes Ted Harrison. "He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation."{{sfn|Harrison|2016|p=10}}

On the 25th anniversary of Presley's death, ''The New York Times'' asserted: <blockquote>All the talentless impersonators and appalling [[velvet Elvis|black velvet paintings]] on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.&nbsp;... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.{{sfn|New York Times|2002}}</blockquote>

He was ranked third on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of greatest artists. [[Bono]] wrote in appreciation: <blockquote>In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness — the gospel highs. The mud — the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.{{sfn|Bono|2010|loc="Elvis"}}</blockquote>

 Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:<blockquote>Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.&nbsp;... Elvis has emerged as a great ''artist'', a great ''rocker'', a great ''purveyor of schlock'', a great ''heart throb'', a great ''bore'', a great ''symbol of potency'', a great ''ham'', a great ''nice person'', and, yes, a great American.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=141–142}}</blockquote>

Having sold about 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales|The estimates of Elvis Presley's record sales vary from 500 million – 1 billion records worldwide.{{sfn|Reuters|2022}}<ref>{{cite book|title= Brandstorm: Surviving and Thriving in the New Consumer-Led Marketplace|publisher=[[ Macmillan Publishers]]|page=77|author=Liz Nickles, Savita Iyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/14/us/elvis-presley-1968-comeback-guitar-auction/index.html|title= An iconic guitar from Elvis Presley's Comeback Special is up for auction|date=14 March 2021|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>}} Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided "Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel" and "Don't/I Beg of You" singles, which precede the inception of ''Billboard''{{'}}s unified [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, are analyzed.{{refn|Whitburn follows actual ''Billboard'' history in considering the four songs on the "Don't Be Cruel/Hound Dog" and "Don't/I Beg of You" singles as distinct. He tallies each side of the former single as a number-one (''Billboard''{{'}}s sales chart had "Don't Be Cruel" at number one for five weeks, then "Hound Dog" for six) and reckons "I Beg of You" as a top ten, as it reached number eight on the old Top 100 chart. ''Billboard'' now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens. ''Billboard'' now states that they yielded just two number ones and a total of two top tens, voiding the separate chart appearances of "Hound Dog" and "I Beg of You".|name=billboard|group=lower-alpha}} According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with [[Madonna]];{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=875}} per ''Billboard''{{'}}s current assessment, he ranks second with 36.{{sfn|Hasty|2008}} Whitburn and ''Billboard'' concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that [[Mariah Carey]] is second with 19.{{sfn|Trust|2022}} Whitburn has Presley with 18:{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=875}} ''Billboard'' has him third with 17.{{sfn|Moody|2008}} According to&nbsp;''Billboard'',&nbsp; Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone at 80, according to Whitburn and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|p=876}}{{sfn|RRHF|2010}} with only Mariah Carey having more with 91 weeks.{{sfn|Trust|2023}} He holds the records for most number-one singles on the UK chart with 21 and singles reaching the top ten with 76.{{sfn|Myers|2022}}{{sfn|Myers|2021}}

As an album artist, Presley is credited by ''Billboard'' with the record for the most albums charting in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]: 129, far ahead of second-place Frank Sinatra's 82. He also holds the record for most cumulative weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 for a male solo artists: 67 weeks{{sfn|Trust|2015}} In 2015 and 2016, two albums setting Presley's vocals against music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, ''[[If I Can Dream (album)|If I Can Dream]]'' and ''[[The Wonder of You (Elvis Presley album)|The Wonder of You]]'', both reached number one in the UK. This gave him a new record for number-one UK albums by a solo artist with 13, and extended his record for longest span between number-one albums by anybody—Presley had first topped the British chart in 1956 with his self-titled debut.{{sfn|Sexton|2016}}

{{as of|2023}}, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5&nbsp;million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and [[Garth Brooks]].{{sfn|RIAA|2020a}} He holds the records for most [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|gold albums]] (101, nearly double second-place [[Barbra Streisand]]'s 51),{{sfn|RIAA|2020b}} and most platinum albums (57).{{sfn|RIAA|2020c}} His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles' 26.{{sfn|RIAA|2020d}} His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles' second-best 122.{{sfn|Lewis|2017}} He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with [[Justin Bieber]]),{{sfn|RIAA|2020e}} and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).{{sfn|RIAA|2020f}}

In 2012, the spider ''[[Paradonea presleyi]]'' was named in his honor.{{sfn|Miller |Griswold |Scharff |Rezac |2012}} In 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] awarded Presley the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] posthumously.{{sfn|BBC News|2018}}

== Discography ==
{{Main|Elvis Presley albums discography|Elvis Presley singles discography|List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley}}

A vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as 665{{sfn|Victor|2008|p=438}} and 711.{{sfn|Feeney|2010}} His career began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music. For his albums, the distinction between "official" studio records and other forms is often blurred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

'''Eric Lafon Heatherly''' (born February 21, 1970) is an American singer. In 2000, he debuted with a cover of [[The Statler Brothers]]' "[[Flowers on the Wall]]", the first of three singles from his debut album ''[[Swimming in Champagne]]'', which was issued in 2000 on [[Mercury Nashville Records]]. A second album for Mercury was planned in 2001 but not released, due to the label's restructuring.

By 2002, he had signed to [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks Nashville]], where he recorded a third studio album which was also unreleased. His fourth overall album, and second to be released, was 2005's ''The Lower East Side of Life'', issued on his own NashVegas Records label.

==Biography==
Eric Heatherly was born February 21, 1970, in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Influenced at an early age by [[country rock]] acts such as [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], Eric wrote his first song at 8.<ref name="allmusic"/> Throughout his teenage years, Heatherly played guitar in several bands in the Chattanooga area.

He later moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he gained a following as a musician, as well as endorsements for guitar manufacturers [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]] and [[Takamine Guitars]].<ref name="allmusic"/> At the 1997 [[Country Music Association]] awards show, Heatherly also played lead guitar in [[Shania Twain]]'s band.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p417055|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Eric Heatherly > Biography ))) |accessdate=2007-12-14 |last=Phares |first=Heather |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

==Musical career==
In 2000, Heatherly was signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]] as a recording artist. His debut single was a [[cover version]] of [[The Statler Brothers]]' 1965 debut single "[[Flowers on the Wall]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1476343/20030808/heatherly_eric.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706210304/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1476343/20030808/heatherly_eric.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 6, 2007 |title="Flowers on the Wall" Blooms Again |accessdate=2007-12-14 |date=2000-02-03 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> Heatherly's rendition was a Top Ten hit on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart, peaking at #6 in mid-2000.

The song served as the first single from his debut album. Entitled ''[[Swimming in Champagne]]'', the album was co-produced by [[Keith Stegall]]. Due to a restructuring of Mercury Nashville's parent company, ''Swimming in Champagne'' received minimal promotion;<ref name="allmusic"/> its second and third singles peaked at #46 and at #32 on the chart. Heatherly had also recorded a second album for Mercury, but it was not released, and Heatherly was dropped from the label by 2002.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1452243/20020211/heatherly_eric.jhtml |title=Heatherly Parts With Mercury |accessdate=2007-12-14 |date=2002-04-11 |work=CMT.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

A month after parting ways with Mercury, Heatherly signed to [[DreamWorks Records]]' Nashville division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1452857/20020312/heatherly_eric.jhtml |title=Heatherly Signs With DreamWorks |accessdate=2007-12-14 |date=2002-03-12 |work=CMT.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> His third album, to be titled ''Sometimes It's Just Your Time'', was to have been released in late 2002. Its lead-off single ("The Last Man Committed") entered the country music chart; although promotional advance copies of the album, ''Sometimes It's Just Your Time'', had been issued, it was ultimately unreleased as well.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Three years after his departure from DreamWorks's roster, he founded a personal label named NashVegas Records, with [[Koch Records]] serving as distributor.<ref name="allmusic"/> His fourth album overall (but only the second to be released), ''[[The Lower East Side of Life]]'', was issued in 2005, though no singles were released from it.<ref name="cw">{{cite journal|last=Hollabaugh|first=Lorie|date=2009-05-11|title=In Bloom Once Again|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=16|issue=13|pages=50}}</ref>

After ''The Lower East Side of Life'', Heatherly continued to tour, in addition to manufacturing custom-made guitar straps. Through the help of songwriter and producer Carson Chamberlain, Heatherly recorded a song called "Unforgettable", which appeared in an episode of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.<ref name="cw"/> He has also recorded another album, ''2 High 2 Cry'', released in 2009.<ref name="cw"/> A second self-released album, ''Painkillers'', followed in 2010.

'''Vincent Eugene Craddock''' (February 11, 1935 – October 12, 1971), known as '''Gene Vincent''', was an American [[rock and roll]] musician who pioneered the style of [[rockabilly]]. His 1956 top ten hit with his backing band [[the Blue Caps]], "[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly.<ref name=pc8/> His chart career was brief, especially in his home country of the US, where he notched three top 40 hits in 1956 and 1957, and never charted in the top 100 again.  In the UK, he was a somewhat bigger star, racking up eight top 40 hits from 1956 to 1961.

Vincent was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker the "Screaming End".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-12 |title=Gene Vincent: The hero before The Beatles |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/gene-vincent-heror-the-beatles/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|title=GENE VINCENT|first=Ian|last=Chaddock|website=Vivelerock.net|access-date=May 22, 2021|archive-date=December 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228151827/https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Craddock was born February 11, 1935, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=Concise |page=1218}}</ref> to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock.<ref name="musicianguide.com">{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000576/Gene-Vincent.html|title=Gene Vincent Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>  His musical influences included [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. His favorite composition was [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont overture]]. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now [[Virginia Beach]]), in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]], Virginia, near the [[North Carolina]] line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.

Craddock's father volunteered to serve in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German [[U-boat]]s during [[World War II]]. Craddock's mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop.

Craddock dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler {{USS|Chukawan|AO-100|6}}, with a two-week training period in the repair ship {{USS|Amphion|AR-13|6}}, before returning to the ''Chukawan''. He never saw combat but completed a [[Korean War]] deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} but was not part of the ship's company.

Craddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycle. On July 4, 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was shattered in an auto crash.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henderson|first=Derek|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70671058|title=Gene Vincent: a companion|year=2005|publisher=Spent Brothers Productions|isbn=0-9519416-7-4|location=Southampton|page=3|oclc=70671058}}</ref> He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain. He wore a steel sheath as a [[leg brace]]<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean-Éric |last1=Perrin |author-link1=:fr:Jean-Éric Perrin |first2=Jerôme |last2=Rey |first3=Gilles |last3=Verlant |author-link3=Gilles Verlant |title=Les Miscellanées du rock |year=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Fetjaine / La Martinière |page=252 |isbn=978-2-35425-130-7 |quote=Gene choisit de se faire poser une gaine d'acier autour des restes de son membre}}</ref> for the rest of his life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John

===Early music career===
Craddock became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene Vincent and formed a rockabilly band, Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LatestNewsGV.html|title=Official Gene Vincent website|publisher=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=2014-04-24|archive-date=November 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105110313/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/LatestNewsGV.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band included Willie Williams on rhythm guitar (replaced in late 1956 by [[Paul Peek]]), Jack Neal on upright bass, Dickie Harrell on drums (died May 31, 2023, at age 82),<ref name="obiDH">{{cite web |url=https://www.lovingfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Richard-Harrell-6/#!/Obituary|title=Richard Dickie Be-Bop Harrell Sr.|date=|accessdate=July 8, 2023|website=lovingfuneralhome.com}}</ref> and [[Cliff Gallup]] on lead guitar.<ref name="Larkin"/> He also collaborated with another rising musician, [[Jay Chevalier]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]]. Vincent and His Blue Caps soon gained a reputation playing in various [[country music|country]] bars in Norfolk. There they won a talent contest organized by a local radio DJ, "Sheriff Tex" Davis, who then became Vincent's manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711034403/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2956395.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 11, 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London, UK|title=Sheriff Tex Davis|date=September 13, 2007|access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

"Be-Bop-a-Lula" was not on Vincent's first album and was picked by Capitol producer [[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]] as the B-side of his first single, "Woman Love". Prior to the release of the single, Lowery pressed promotional copies of "Be-Bop-a-Lula" and sent them to radio stations throughout the country. By the time Capitol released the single, "Be-Bop-a-Lula" had already gained attention from the public and radio DJs. The song was picked up and played by other U.S. radio stations (obscuring the original A-side song) and became a hit, peaking at number 7 and spending 20 weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=152}} and reaching number 5 and spending 17 weeks on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' chart,<ref>{{cite web|date=|title=Cash Box Country Singles 11/03/56|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210311111104/http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/50s_files/19561103C.html|archive-date=March 11, 2021|website=CASHBOX Magazine|access-date=March 11, 2021}}</ref> and launching Vincent's career as a rock-and-roll star.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32014167|title=Billboard's hottest hot 100 hits|date=1995|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=0-8230-7646-6|edition=|location=New York|pages=253|oclc=32014167}}</ref>

After "Be-Bop-a-Lula" became a hit, Vincent and His Blue Caps were unable to follow it up with the same level of commercial success, although they released critically acclaimed songs like "Race with the Devil" (number 96 on the ''Billboard'' chart and number 50 on the ''Cash Box'' chart) and "[[Bluejean Bop]]" (number 49 on the ''Billboard'' chart and another million-selling disc).<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

Cliff Gallup left the band in 1956, and Russell Williford joined as the new guitarist for the Blue Caps. Williford played and toured Canada with Vincent in late 1956 but left the group in early 1957. Gallup came back to do the next album and then left again.

The late 1959 single "Wild Cat" was credited solely to Gene Vincent, and this would be the case on all subsequent Gene Vincent releases.

===Europe===
A dispute with the [[Internal Revenue Service|US tax authorities]] and the American Musicians' Union over payments to his band and his having sold the band's equipment to pay a tax bill led Vincent to leave the United States for Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farren|first=Mick|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/784882138|title=The Mammoth Book of Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll.|publisher=Constable & Robinson|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84901-461-8|editor-last=Driver|editor-first=Jim.|location=London|pages=50–51|chapter=Gene Vincent – The Genesis of the Dark Side|oclc=784882138}}</ref>

On April 16, 1960, while on tour in the UK, Vincent, [[Eddie Cochran]] and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]]. Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and further damaged his weakened leg.<ref name="Larkin"/> Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day. Vincent returned to the United States after the accident.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While they were preparing to board their taxi, Vincent and Cochran had rebuffed [[Tony Sheridan]]'s request to ride along with them to the next venue. After escaping that fateful road accident,<ref>https://www.rte.ie/radio/doconone/771586-are-you-tony-sheridan Martin Duffy. ''Are You Tony Sheridan?'' (RTÉ [[Doc on One]] radio documentary), 17 July 2010.</ref> Sheridan soon relocated to Hamburg, where he helped influence the musical training of many British groups who would later become part of the [[British Invasion]], including one of his backing bands, [[the Beatles]].

Promoter [[Don Arden]] had Vincent return to the UK in 1961 to do an extensive tour in theatres and ballrooms,<ref name="Larkin"/> including the Agincourt Ballroom, Camberley<ref name=":0">Ronnie Wood (Show) in conversation with Paul McCartney confirmed meeting Vincent at the venue. sky.com/ronnie</ref> with Chris Wayne and the [[The Echoes (English group)|Echoes]].

===Later career===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2014}}
Vincent's attempts to re-establish his American career in [[folk rock]] and [[country rock]] proved unsuccessful; he is remembered today for recordings of the 1950s and early 1960s released by [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In the early 1960s, he also put out tracks on EMI's [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, including a cover of [[Arthur Alexander]]'s "Where Have You Been All My Life?" A backing band called the Shouts joined him.

[[File:Genevincent015e.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Vincent, 1967]]
In 1966 and 1967, in the United States, he recorded for [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]], backed by ex-members of the [[the Champs|Champs]] and [[Glen Campbell]]. Challenge released three singles in the US, and the UK [[London Records|London]] label released two singles and collected recordings on to an LP, ''Gene Vincent'', on the UK London label in 1967. Although well received, none sold well. In 1968 in a hotel in Germany, Vincent tried to shoot Paul Raven, later to find fame as [[Gary Glitter]]. He fired several shots but missed and a frightened Raven left the country the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channelhopping.onthebox.com/2012/12/14/regrettable-television-this-your-life-gary-glitter|title=Regrettable Television: This Is Your Life, Gary Glitter|publisher=Channelhopping.onthebox.com|date=December 14, 2012|access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref>
 
In 1969, he recorded the album ''I'm Back and I'm Proud'' for long-time fan [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]],<ref name="Larkin"/> produced by [[Kim Fowley]] with arrangements by [[Skip Battin]] (of the [[the Byrds|Byrds]]), [[Mars Bonfire]] on rhythm guitar, Johnny Meeks (of Blue Caps and Merle Haggard's [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]]) on lead guitar, [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] on drums, and backing vocals by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and Jackie Frisco.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=34}} While recording the track "Sexy Ways" for the album Vincent threatened to get a gun from his car and shoot [[Paul A.

On his 1969 tour of the UK he was backed by the [[The Wild Angels (band)|Wild Angels]], a British band that had performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. Because of pressure from his ex-wife Margaret Russell, the [[Inland Revenue]] and promoter [[Don Arden]], Vincent returned to the US.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagarty|first=Britt|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11869138|title=The day the world turned blue: a biography of Gene Vincent|date=1984|publisher=Blandford|isbn=0-7137-1531-6|location=Poole|pages=245|oclc=11869138}}</ref>

His final US recordings were four tracks for Rockin' Ronny Weiser's Rolling Rock label, a few weeks before his death. These were released on a compilation album of tribute songs, including "Say Mama", by his daughter, Melody Jean Vincent, accompanied by Johnny Meeks on guitar. On 19 September 1971, he began his last series of gigs in Britain.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=4}} He was backed by Richard Cole and Kansas Hook (Dave Bailey, Bob Moore, and bass player Charlie Harrison from Poco and Roger McGuinn's Thunderbyrd). They recorded four tracks ("Say Mama", "Be-Bop-A-Lula", "Roll Over Beethoven", "[[Distant Drums (song)|Distant Drums]]") at the BBC studios in [[Maida Vale]], London, for [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker's]] [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show. The fifth record ("[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]") remained unfinished.{{sfn|Henderson|2005|p=36}} He managed one show at the Garrick Night Club in [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], [[Lancashire]], and two shows at the Wookey Hollow Club in [[Liverpool]] on October 3 and 4. Vincent then returned to the US and died a few days later. In September, 1974, BBC launched pop label BEEB with a maxi single by Vincent ("Roll Over Beethoven", BEEB 001). The single comprised three of these tracks.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=BBC's BEEB to Bow With Maxi-Single |url= |magazine=Billboard |location= |publisher= |date=1974-09-14|page=56 |access-date=}}</ref> The four tracks are now on Vincent's album ''White Lightning''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Writing for [[AllMusic]], [[Ritchie Unterberger]] called Vincent "an American rockabilly legend who defined the greasy-haired, leather-jacketed, hot rods 'n' babes spark of rock and roll."<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Ritchie|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-vincent-mn0000803720|title=Gene Vincent|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] was less impressed by the musician's career, saying "Vincent was never a titan – his few moments of rockabilly greatness were hyped-up distillations of slavering lust from a sensitive little guy who was just as comfortable with 'Over the Rainbow' in his normal frame of mind." However, he included Vincent's [[compilation album]] ''The Bop That Just Won't Stop'' (1974) in his "basic record library", published in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981).<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: V|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=V&bk=70|access-date=March 21, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

'''Hiram''' '''King''' "'''Hank'''" '''Williams''' (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter. He is regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century. Williams recorded 55 singles that reached the top 10 of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country & Western Best Sellers chart]], five of which were released posthumously, and 12 of which reached No.1.

Born and raised in Alabama, Williams learned guitar from African-American [[blues]] musician [[Rufus Payne]]. Both Payne and [[Roy Acuff]] significantly influenced his musical style. After winning an amateur talent contest, Williams began his professional career in Montgomery in the late 1930s playing on local radio stations and at area venues such as school houses, movie theaters, and bars. He formed the [[Drifting Cowboys]] backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. Because his alcoholism made him unreliable, he was fired and rehired several times by radio station [[WSFA]], and had trouble replacing several of his band members who were drafted during World War II.

In 1944, Williams married [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]], who competed with his mother to control his career. After recording "Never Again" and "[[Honky Tonkin']]{{-"}} with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]], he signed a contract with [[MGM Records]]. He released the hit single "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It On Over]]" in 1947 and joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' radio program. The next year he released a cover of "[[Lovesick Blues]]", which quickly reached number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} Top Country & Western singles chart and propelled him to stardom on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Although unable to read or [[musical notation|notate music]] to any significant degree, he wrote such iconic hits as "[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]", "[[Hey, Good Lookin' (song)|Hey, Good Lookin']]{{-"}}, and "[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]". In 1952, Audrey<!--She took the surname Williams after her marriage, thus, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Biography#People_with_the_same_surname, is referred to as "Audrey" from now on.--> divorced him and he married [[Billie Jean Horton]]. He was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcoholism.

Years of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely compromised Williams's health, and at the age of 29, Williams suffered from heart failure and [[Death of Hank Williams|died unexpectedly]] in the back seat of a car near [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]], en route to a concert in [[Canton, Ohio]], on New Year's Day 1953. Despite his relatively brief career, he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in [[country music]]. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced [[Chuck Berry]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[the Rolling Stones]], among others. He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1961, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Native American Music Awards]] Hall of Fame in 1999, and gained a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 2010, he was posthumously awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citation]] for his "craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life."

==Early life==
[[File:Hank-Williams-Georgiana-House.jpeg|thumb|Williams's family house in [[Georgiana, Alabama]]]]

Hank Williams was born Hiram Williams on September 17, 1923, in the rural community of Mount Olive in [[Butler County, Alabama]].{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=6}} He was the third child of Jessie Lillybelle "Lillie" (née Skipper; 1898–1955) and Elonzo Huble "Lon" Williams (1891–1970).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=4-6}} Williams was of [[English American|English ancestry]] and [[Welsh American|Welsh ancestry]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://birthplaceofwesternswing.com/williams.html#:~:text=Williams%20was%20born%20in%20Butler,Smith%20lumber%20company | title=Cowtown Birthplace of Western Swing - Hank Williams }}</ref><ref name="Breverton2009">{{cite book |last1=Breverton |first1=Terry |title=Wales: A Historical Companion |year=2009 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1-4456-0990-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2qoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.abctales.com/story/carl-halling/luke-drifter-and-secrets-country | title=Luke the Drifter and the Secrets of Country &#124; ABCtales }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://birthplaceofwesternswing.com/williams.html#:~:text=Williams%20was%20born%20in%20Butler,he%20was%20of%20English%20ancestry | title=Cowtown Birthplace of Western Swing - Hank Williams }}</ref><ref name="Ribowsky">{{cite book |last1=Ribowsky |first1=Mark |title=Hank: The Short Life and Long Country Road of Hank Williams |year=2016 |publisher=Liveright Publishing |isbn=978-1-63149-158-0 |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeOaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT15}}</ref>  Elonzo's family came from south and central Alabama,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=5}} and his father fought during the [[American Civil War]], first on the Confederate side, and then with the Union after he was captured.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=15}} Elonzo was a [[railroad engineer]] for the W. T. Smith lumber company and was drafted during [[World War I]], serving from July 1918 to June 1919. He suffered severe injuries after falling from a truck, breaking his collarbone, and receiving a severe blow to the head.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=4-6}}

The Williams' first child, Ernest Huble Williams, died two days after his birth on July 5, 1921. A daughter, Irene, was born a year later. Williams was named after [[Hiram I]] of the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=3}} His name was misspelled as "Hiriam" on his birth certificate, which was prepared and signed when he was 10 years old.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=6–7}}  Williams was born with [[spina bifida occulta]], a birth defect of the [[spinal column]] that caused him lifelong pain and became a major factor in his later alcohol and drug abuse.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=10}} At the age of three, Williams sat with his mother as she played the organ at the Mount Olive Baptist Church. Lillie also joined singing the hymns that influenced the singer's later compositions. Williams received his first musical instrument, a harmonica, at the age of six.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=11}} As a child, he was nicknamed "Harm" by his family and "Herky" or "Skeets" by his friends.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=7}}

Williams's father frequently relocated for work, and as a result the family lived in several southern Alabama towns. In 1930, when Williams was seven years old, Elonzo began experiencing facial [[paralysis]]. After being evaluated at a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] clinic in [[Pensacola, Florida]], doctors determined that he had a [[brain aneurysm]], and Elonzo was sent to the VA Medical Center in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=9}} He remained hospitalized for eight years and was mostly absent throughout Williams's childhood. From that point on, Lillie assumed responsibility for the family.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=8-10}}

In the fall of 1933, Williams was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Walter and Alice McNeil, in Fountain, Alabama. Their daughter, Opal, went in exchange to live with Lillie to attend school in [[Georgiana, Alabama]]. Williams learned to play basic guitar chords from his aunt and listened to music that was played at dances and in area churches.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=18-21}} The following year, the Williams family moved to [[Greenville, Alabama]], where Lillie opened a [[boarding house]] next to the local [[cotton gin]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=13-14}} The family later returned with Opal McNeil to Georgiana, where Lillie took several side jobs to support the family despite the bleak economic climate of the [[Great Depression]]. She worked in a [[cannery]] and served as a night-shift nurse in the local hospital. Their first house burned down, and the family lost their possessions. They moved to Rose Street on the other side of town, into a house which Williams's mother soon turned into another boarding house. The house had a small garden in which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=10-14}} At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Williams's sister Irene met U.S. Representative [[J. Lister Hill]] while Hill was campaigning across Alabama. She told Hill that her mother was interested in talking to him about her problems. With Hill's help, the family began collecting Elonzo's [[disability pension]].{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=27}} Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=16-17}}

{{Listen |filename=Hank Williams - My Bucket's Got a Hole in It.ogg|title=My Bucket's Got a Hole in It |description=The popular song "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It" became a hit for Hank Williams in 1949.}}

There are several versions of how Williams got his first guitar. While several prominent Georgiana residents later claimed to have bought it for him, his mother said she bought it for him and that she arranged for his first lessons.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=20}} Williams told [[Ralph Gleason]], who at the time was writing a weekly music column in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "When I was about eight years old, I got my first git-tar. A second-hand $3.50 git-tar my mother bought me."{{sfn|Betts, Stephen L.|2019}} Gawky and shy, Williams attached himself to an old black man, [[Rufus Payne|Rufus "Tee-Tot" Payne]], a street performer whom Williams followed around town. Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for money or meals prepared by Lillie.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=20-26}} Payne's basic musical style was [[blues]]; he repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining good rhythm and time,{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=12}} and he added the showmanship of stoops, bows, laughs and cries to his performances.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=23}} Later on, Williams recorded "[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]", one of the songs Payne had taught him.{{sfn|Brackett, David|p=98|2000}} Williams was also influenced by country acts such as [[Roy Acuff]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=21-23}} In 1937, Williams got into a fight with his physical education teacher about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama]].{{sfn|Masino, Susan|2011|p=11}} Payne and Williams lost touch, though Payne also eventually moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=229}} Williams later credited him as the provider of the only musical training he ever had.{{sfn|Rankin, Allen|1951|p=3C}}

==Career==
===1930s===
[[File:HankWilliams1938-Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams performing in Montgomery in 1938]]

In July 1937, the Williams and McNeils opened a [[boarding house]] on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It was at this time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=19-21}} During the same year, he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater and won the first prize of US$15 ({{Inflation|US|15|1937|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) singing his first original song "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of [[Riley Puckett]]'s "Dissatisfied".{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=16}}

He never learned to read music; instead he based his compositions in storytelling and personal experience.{{sfn|Rankin, Allen|1951|p=3C}}
After school and on weekends, Williams sang and played his [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] guitar on the sidewalk in front of the [[WLWI (AM)|WSFA]] radio studio.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=28}} His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air with Dad Crysel's band.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=16-17}}

In August 1938, Elonzo Williams was temporarily released from the hospital. He showed up unannounced at the family's home in Montgomery. Lillie was unwilling to let him reclaim his position as the head of the household. Elonzo stayed to celebrate his son's birthday in September before he returned to the medical center in Louisiana.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=30}}

Williams's successful radio show fueled his entry into a music career, and he started his own band for show dates, the [[Drifting Cowboys]]. The original members were guitarist Braxton Schuffert, fiddler Freddie Beach, and comedian Smith "Hezzy" Adair.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=20-21}} Originally billed as "Hank and Hezzy and the Drifting Cowboys", they frequently appeared as fill-ins at the local dancehall, Thigpen's Log Cabin, just out of Georgiana.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=37}} The band traveled throughout central and southern Alabama performing in clubs and at private gatherings. James Ellis Garner later played fiddle for him. Lillie Williams became the Drifting Cowboys' manager. Williams dropped out of school in October 1939 so that he and the Drifting Cowboys could work full-time. Lillie Williams began booking show dates, negotiating prices and driving them to some of their shows.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=16-18}} Now free to travel without deference to Williams's schooling, the band could tour as far away as western Georgia and the [[Florida Panhandle]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=24}} The band started playing in theaters before [[film screening|the screening of films]] and later they played in [[honky-tonk]]s. Williams's alcohol use started to become a problem during the tours; on occasion he spent a large part of the show revenues on alcohol. Meanwhile, between tour schedules, Williams returned to Montgomery to host his radio show.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=34-37}}

===1940s===
[[File:Hank Williams Drifting Cowboys Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Williams, Sheppard, and the Drifting Cowboys band in 1951]]
The American entry into [[World War II]] in 1941 marked the beginning of hard times for Williams. While he was [[Selective Training and Service Act|medically disqualified from military service]] after falling from a bull during a [[rodeo]] in Texas and suffering a back injury, his band members were all [[Selective Training and Service Act|drafted]] to serve. Many of their replacements quit the band due to Williams's worsening alcoholism, and in August 1942 WSFA fired him for "habitual drunkenness". Backstage during one of his concerts, Williams met [[Roy Acuff]], who warned him of the dangers of alcohol, saying, "You've got a million-dollar voice, son, but a ten-cent brain."{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=39-40}}

He started a job as a shipfitter's helper for the [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in 1942,{{sfn|Lipsitz|1994|p=26}} working there off and on for about a year and a half during the war. He also worked briefly at [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in Portland, Oregon, apparently lured by the free tickets, free accommodations, free training, and good wages offered by the company.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=33}} In 1943, Williams met [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]] at a [[medicine show]] in [[Banks, Alabama]]. According to Sheppard, she and Williams lived in a hotel in Mobile while they worked together at the shipyard for a short while.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=34-35, 38-39}} Sheppard told Williams that she wanted to help him regain his radio show, and that they should move to Montgomery and start a band. The couple were married in 1944 at a [[Texaco]] gas station in [[Andalusia, Alabama]], by a justice of the peace. The marriage was technically invalid, since Sheppard's divorce from her previous husband did not comply with the legally required 60-day reconciliation period.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=23-24}}

In 1945, back in Montgomery, Williams returned to WSFA radio. He attempted to expand his repertoire by writing original songs,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=42}} and he published his first songbook, ''Original Songs of Hank Williams'', containing "I'm Not Coming Home Anymore" and several more original songs,{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=41-42}} nine in all, including one not written by him, "A Tramp on the Street".{{sfn|Williams, Hank|1945}} With Williams beginning to be recognized as a songwriter, Sheppard became his manager and occasionally sang and substituted on guitar when a band member did not make the show.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=56-57}}

On September 14, 1946, Williams auditioned for Nashville's [[Grand Ole Opry]] at the recommendation of  [[Ernest Tubb]], but was rejected. After the failure of his audition, Williams and Audrey attempted to interest the recently formed music publishing firm [[Acuff-Rose Music]]. They approached [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]], the president of the company, during one of his daily ping-pong games at WSM radio studios. Audrey asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him at that moment, Rose agreed, and perceived that Williams had much promise as a songwriter.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=58-60}} Rose signed Williams to a six-song contract, and leveraged this deal to sign Williams with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]]. On December 11, 1946, in his first recording session, Williams recorded "Wealth Won't Save Your Soul", "Calling You", "[[Never Again (Will I Knock on Your Door)]]", and "When God Comes and Gathers His Jewels", which was misprinted as "When God Comes and ''Fathers'' His Jewels".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=59-60}} The Sterling releases of Williams's songs became successful, and Rose decided to find a larger label for future releases. The producer then approached the newly formed recording division of the [[Loews Corporation]], [[MGM Records]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=64-65}}
{{Listen |filename=Lovesick Blues Hank Williams.ogg |title=Lovesick Blues |description=A major hit for Hank Williams, "[[Lovesick Blues]]" moved him to the mainstream of country music and assured him a position in the [[Grand Ole Opry]].}}

Williams signed with MGM Records in 1947 and released "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]", which became a country hit.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=66-67}} In 1948, he moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', a radio show broadcast on [[KWKH]] that brought him into living rooms all over the Southeastern United States, appearing in weekend shows. As part of the arrangement, Williams got a program on the station and bookings through the ''Hayride''{{'s}} artist service to perform across western Louisiana and eastern Texas, always returning on Saturdays for the show's weekly broadcast.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=69-71}} After a few more moderate hits, in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Irving Mills]] song "[[Lovesick Blues]]", made popular by [[Rex Griffin]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=98-99}} Williams's version was a hit; the song stayed at number one on the ''Billboard'' charts for four consecutive months.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=100}} Following the success of the releases of "Lovesick Blues" and "[[Wedding Bells (Hank Williams song)|Wedding Bells]]", Williams signed a management contract with Oscar Davis. Davis then booked the singer on a ''Grand Ole Opry'' package show, and he later negotiated Williams's induction into the musical troupe.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=109, 113, 116}}

On June 11, 1949, Williams made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry, where he received six [[encore]]s.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=41-42}} He brought together Bob McNett (guitar), [[Hillous Butrum]] ([[Double bass|bass]]), [[Jerry Rivers]] ([[fiddle]]) and [[Don Helms]] ([[steel guitar]]) to form the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=46-50}} That year Audrey Williams gave birth to Randall Hank Williams ([[Hank Williams Jr.]]).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=43}} During 1949, he joined the Grand Ole Opry's first European tour, performing in military bases in Germany and Austria.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=131}} Williams had five songs that ranked in the top five ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles that year including:  "Wedding Bells", "[[Mind Your Own Business]]", "[[You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)]]", "[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]", and "Lovesick Blues", which reached No. 1.{{sfn|Young, William H.|Young, Nancy K.|2010|p=235}}

===1950s===
By 1950, Williams earned an estimated $1,000 per show ({{Inflation|US|1000|1950|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}).{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=50}} That year, he began recording as "Luke the Drifter" for his moral-themed songs, many of which are recitations rather than singing. Fred Rose had been concerned how it would affect the jukebox operators who serviced the machines at the honky-tonks where William's songs were most commonly played if a customer punched a "Hank Williams" selection on a jukebox and heard a sermon rather than the music expected. It was he who requested that Hank use a pseudonym for these recitations to avoid leading people astray.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=117-118}} Although the real identity of Luke the Drifter was supposed to be unknown, Williams often performed part of the recorded material on stage. Most of the material was written by Williams himself, although Fred Rose wrote at least one piece, and others, according to his son [[Wesley Rose|Wesley]], were collaborations between Williams, Rose, and himself.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=129}} The songs depicted Luke the Drifter traveling around from place to place, narrating stories of different characters{{sfn|Hurd, Mary G.|2015|p=12}} and philosophizing about relationships gone awry, injustice in society, and death.{{sfn|Wilmeth|2014|p=250}} Performances of the compositions included only Williams's voice, an organ, a [[Double bass|bass fiddle]], and Helms' steel guitar.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|pp=118}}

Around this time Williams released more hit songs, such as "[[My Son Calls Another Man Daddy]]", "[[Why Should We Try Anymore]]", "[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]", "[[Why Don't You Love Me (Hank Williams song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]", and "[[I Just Don't Like This Kind of Living|I Just Don't Like This Kind of Livin']]".{{sfn|Billboard staff|1951|p=19}} In 1951, "[[Dear John (Hank Williams song)|Dear John]]" became a hit, but it was the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]", that became one of his most recognized songs.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=155-159}} A pop cover version by [[Tony Bennett]] released the same year stayed on the charts for 27 weeks, peaking at number one.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|p=26|1991}}

{{Listen |filename=Beyond The Sunset Hank Williams.ogg |title=Beyond the Sunset |description=One characteristic of Williams's recordings as "Luke the Drifter" is the use of narration rather than singing.}}
Williams's career reached a peak in the late summer of 1951 with his [[Hadacol]] tour of the U.S. with [[Bob Hope]] and other actors. On the weekend after the tour ended, Williams was photographed backstage at the Grand Ole Opry signing a motion picture deal with [[MGM]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=190}} In October, Williams recorded a demo, "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]" for a friend, "[[Big Bill Lister]]", who had recorded "Beer Drinking Blues", a beer drinking song that sold well, and needed another one. The session was recorded by the head of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for [[Capitol Records]], [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. Afterwards Lister stored the demo acetate, with no markings, in a box of records kept at his house, and then when he moved, in his yard under a tarp for several years. He eventually gave the acetate to Hank Williams, Jr., who had a hit with it and an accompanying video which depicted the son playing with his father in an overdubbed dream sequence.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=180–181}} The following month, MGM Records released Williams's debut album, ''[[Hank Williams Sings]]''. On November 14, 1951, Williams drove with Bill Lister and the Drifting Cowboys to New York where he appeared on television for the first time with [[Perry Como]] on CBS's ''[[Perry Como television and radio shows|Perry Como Show]]''.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=191}} There he sang "Hey Good Lookin'", and the next week Como opened the show wearing a cowboy hat and singing the same song, with apologies to Williams.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=191–193}}

On May 21, 1951, Williams was admitted to North Louisiana Sanitarium in Shreveport for treatment of his alcoholism and his back problem, and was released on May 24.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=153, 154}} In November of the same year, he fell trying to leap across a gully on a squirrel hunting trip with his fiddler Jerry Rivers in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. The fall aggravated his congenital spinal condition, {{sfn|Koon, George William|p=63|2001}} and on December 13, 1951, he underwent a [[spinal fusion]] at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center|Vanderbilt University Hospital]]. He was discharged against medical advice on Christmas Eve wearing a back brace and consuming more painkillers, to the detriment of his already compromised health.{{sfn|Koon, George William|pp=63, 153–154|2001}}

[[File:HankWilliams1951concert.jpg|thumb|Williams performing in 1951|left|upright=0.9]]

In the spring of 1952, Williams flew to New York City twice with his band and a Grand Ole Opry troupe to appear on two episodes of the nationally broadcast ''[[Kate Smith|The Kate Smith Evening Hour]]''.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=209, 211}} On March 26, he performed "[[Hey Good Lookin' (song)|Hey Good Lookin']]" and joined the rest of the cast in singing "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]".{{sfn|CMHoF|2023a}} On April 23, he performed "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]" and sang a truncated "[[I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)]]" with [[Anita Carter]], and later joined the cast in singing "Glory Bound Train".{{sfn|CMHoF|2023b}} During the same year, Williams had a brief extramarital affair with dancer Bobbie Jett, resulting in the birth of their daughter, [[Jett Williams]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=209, 226-227}}

In June 1952, he recorded "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]", "[[Window Shopping (song)|Window Shopping]]", "[[Settin' the Woods on Fire]]", and "[[I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive]]". Audrey Williams divorced him that year; the next day he recorded "[[You Win Again (Hank Williams song)|You Win Again]]" and "[[I Won't Be Home No More]]".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=213-216}} Around this time, he met [[Billie Jean Horton|Billie Jean Jones]], a girlfriend of country singer [[Faron Young]], at the Grand Ole Opry. As a girl, Jones had lived down the street from Williams when he was with the Louisiana Hayride, and now Williams began to visit her frequently in Shreveport, causing him to miss many Grand Ole Opry appearances.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=201-204}}

On August 11, 1952, Williams was dismissed from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport to perform on [[KWKH]] and [[WBAM]] shows and in the ''Louisiana Hayride'', for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but despite the efforts of his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=197-199}} In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=70}}

During his last recording session on September 23, 1952, Williams recorded "[[Kaw-Liga (song)|Kaw-Liga]]", along with "[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]", "[[Take These Chains from My Heart]]", and "[[I Could Never Be Ashamed of You]]". By the end of 1952, Williams started to have heart problems.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=67}} He met Horace "Toby" Marshall in [[Oklahoma City]], who said that he was a doctor. Marshall had been previously convicted for forgery, and had been paroled and released from the [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]] in 1951. Among other fake titles, he said that he was a [[Doctor of Science]]. He purchased the DSC title for $25 from the ''Chicago School of Applied Science''; in the diploma, he requested that the DSc be spelled out as "Doctor of Science and Psychology". Under the name of Dr. C. W. Lemon he prescribed Williams with [[amphetamines]], [[Seconal]], [[chloral hydrate]], and [[morphine]], which made his heart problems worse.{{sfn|Koon, George William|p=74|2001}} The final concert of his 1952 tour was held in Austin, Texas, at the Skyline Club on December 19.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=255–256}} Williams's last known public performance took place in Montgomery, on December 21, where he sang at a benefit held by the local chapter of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] for a radio announcer who had polio.{{sfn|Koon, George William|p=75, 154|2001}}{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=212}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Hank and Audrey Williams MGM publicity - Cropped.jpeg|thumb|upright|Williams and his first wife [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]] in a publicity photo for [[MGM Records]], c. 1952]]
On December 15, 1944, Williams married [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]].<!--She took the surname Williams after her marriage, thus, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Biography#People_with_the_same_surname, is referred to by name as "Audrey" to distinguish her from "Hank".--> It was her second marriage and his first.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=22-24}} Their son, Randall Hank Williams (now known as [[Hank Williams Jr.]]), was born on May 26, 1949.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=40}} The marriage was always turbulent and rapidly disintegrated,{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=26, 36-38}} and Williams developed serious problems with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his [[spina bifida occulta]].{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=9-10}} The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=96}}

In June 1952, Williams moved into a house on the corner of Natchez Trace and Westwood Avenue in Nashville, sharing it with singer [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=202}}{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=193}} Price left soon after due to Williams's alcoholism.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=195}} Following an unsuccessful tour of California and several stints in a sanitorium, Williams moved to his mother's boardinghouse by September.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=65-67}} A relationship with a woman named Bobbie Jett during this period resulted in a daughter, [[Jett Williams]], who was born five days after Williams died.
His mother adopted Jett, who became a ward of the state after her grandmother's death. She was adopted and raised by an unrelated couple and did not learn that she was Williams's daughter until the early 1980s.{{sfn|Williams, Hilary|Roberts, Mary Beth|p=127|2010}}

On October 18, 1952, Williams and [[Billie Jean Jones]] were married by a justice of the peace in [[Minden, Louisiana]]. The next day, two public marriage ceremonies were held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=68–70}} After Williams's death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones' divorce had not become final until 11 days after she married Williams. His first wife and his mother were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid, and they pursued the matter for years.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=233–236}}

A man named Lewis Fitzgerald (born 1943) claimed to be Williams's illegitimate son; he was the son of Marie McNeil, Williams's cousin. Fitzgerald was interviewed, and he suggested that Lillie Williams operated a brothel at her boarding house in Montgomery. A friend of the family denied his claims, but singer [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] claimed that Williams mentioned to him the presence of men in the house who were led upstairs.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=43}}

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Hank Williams}}
Williams was scheduled to perform at the [[Charleston Municipal Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], on New Years Eve, December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled $3,000.{{sfn|Lilly, John|2002|pp=64-65}} That day, Williams could not fly because of a snow storm in the Montgomery area; he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=213}} On December 30, Williams and Carr stopped at the [[Redmont Hotel]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The following morning, they continued to [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]], and then to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Williams and his driver then took a flight to Charleston, but the plane returned to Knoxville due to bad weather.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=265-266}} Back in Knoxville, the two arrived at the [[Andrew Johnson Building|Andrew Johnson Hotel]], and Carr requested a doctor for Williams, who was affected by the combination of the [[chloral hydrate]] and alcohol he had consumed on the way to Knoxville.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|p=295}} Dr. P. H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] that also contained a quarter-grain of [[morphine]]. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel, but the porters had to carry Williams to the car. Carr later mentioned that Williams had severe hiccups, while the porters said that he had made a coughing sound twice.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|pp=296-298}} Carr spoke with Toby Marshall on the phone, who informed him on behalf of the tour's promoter, A.V. Bamford, that the show in Charleston was cancelled and he ordered him instead to drive Williams to [[Canton, Ohio]], for a New Year's Day concert there.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=267}}

[[File:Hank Williams Memorial Montgomery Alabama.JPG|right|thumb|Entrance marker of the Oakwood Annex Cemetery in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]]]
Around midnight on January 1, 1953, the two crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in [[Bristol, Virginia]]. Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked for a relief driver from a local taxi company, as he felt exhausted after driving for 20 hours. Driver Don Surface left the restaurant with Carr and Williams. They drove on until they stopped for fuel and coffee at a gas station in [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]], where they realized that Williams had been dead for so long that [[rigor mortis]] had already set in. The station's owner called the local police chief.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=268–270}} Dr. Ivan Malinin performed the [[autopsy]] at the Tyree Funeral House.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=271}} He found hemorrhages in the heart and neck and pronounced the cause of death as "acute rt. ventricular dilation".{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=78}} He also wrote that Williams had been severely beaten and kicked in the groin recently (during a fight in a Montgomery bar a few days earlier), and local magistrate Virgil F. Lyons ordered an inquest into Williams's death concerning a welt that was visible on his head.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=271}} That evening in Canton, when Williams's death was announced to the gathered crowd, a few people started laughing because they thought it was a joke. Akron deejay Cliff Rodgers assured the crowd that it was no joke and that Hank Williams was indeed dead. When [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]] and other performers started singing Williams's song "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]" as a tribute to him, the crowd began to sing along.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=275–276}}

On January 2, Williams's body was transported to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], where it was placed in a silver casket that was displayed at his mother's boarding house for two days. His funeral took place on January 4 at the Montgomery Auditorium, with his casket placed on the flower-covered stage.  Mourners came to Montgomery from all over the South, and beyond.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=223–224}} An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 people were outside the auditorium, and inside were 2,750, with the balcony set aside for about 200 black mourners. Hundreds passed by the casket.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=276–280}} Backed by the Drifting Cowboys, Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb and [[Red Foley]] performed "I Saw the Light", "[[Beyond the Sunset (song)|Beyond the Sunset]]" and "[[Peace in the Valley]]".{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=190}}  Williams's remains are interred at the [[Oakwood Cemetery (Montgomery, Alabama)|Oakwood Annex]] in Montgomery.{{sfn|Peterson, Richard A.|1997|p=182}}

In late January 1953, [[MGM Records]] told ''Billboard'' magazine that the label had to reduce their planned releases for the month from 12 records to 6 to satisfy the demand for Williams's music. The label estimated that the amount of back orders of his records, and those by other artists would cover the production of their [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]], pressing plant until April 1953. Meanwhile, MGM Records received 3,000 direct requests for pictures of the singer, that combined with the requests from the distributors made the company outsource their printing and shipment. According to Acuff-Rose Music, the sales from the two Williams song folios jumped from their average of 700 per week to 5,000 in three weeks.{{sfn|Billboard staff|1953a|p=15}}

Williams's final single, released in November 1952 while he was still alive, was titled "[[I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive]]". His song "Your Cheatin' Heart" was written and recorded in September 1952, but released in late January 1953 after his death. The song, backed by "[[Kaw-Liga]]", was No. 1 on the country charts for six weeks.  "Take These Chains From My Heart" was released in April 1953 and reached No. 1 on the country charts.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=199}}{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=288-289}} Released in July, "I Won't Be Home No More" went to No. 4. Meanwhile, "Weary Blues From Waitin'" reached No. 7.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|2002|p=391}}

The [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] stressed that Williams "set the agenda for contemporary country songcraft" and the "standard by which success is measured in country music".{{sfn|CMHoF|2023c}} ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' considers him "country music's first superstar" and an "immensely talented songwriter and an impassioned vocalist".{{sfn|Wallenfeldt, Jeff|2023}} The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] praised the "straightforward approach" of Williams's songs, which they deemed "brutally honest" and written in the "language of the everyman".{{sfn|RockHall|2023}} To [[AllMusic]], Williams "established the rules for all the country performers who followed him and, in the process, much of popular music".{{sfn|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|2013}}

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} TV critic, Ken Tucker, wrote: "despite being a pop-culture titan and rightly dubbed "father of country music", Hank Williams was possibly the least likable — least warm and sympathetic — figure in modern music. Reeking of self-pity, he wrote and sang some of the greatest woe-is-me music of the century [...] Brimming with an anger that regularly spilled over into misogyny, Williams was also a master of spite".{{sfn|Tucker, Ken|1998}} Hank Williams, Jr. wrote in his autobiography: "To hear the tributes, one would think that the entire city [Nashville] took turns kissing Daddy while he was still alive. [...] While he was alive, he was despised and envied; after he died, he was some kind of saint."{{sfn|Williams|Bane|1979|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o_Y5AQAAIAAJ&q=%22kissing%20Daddy%22 64]}}

Several of Williams's descendants became musicians: son Hank Williams Jr., daughter [[Jett Williams]], grandsons [[Hank Williams III]] and Sam Williams, and granddaughters Hilary Williams and [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]] are also country musicians.{{sfn|Chiu, David|2010}}{{sfn|AP staff|2008}}{{sfn|Betts, Stephen L.|2018}} In July 2020, his granddaughter Katherine (Hank Jr.'s daughter) died in a car crash at the age of 27.{{sfn|Pasquini, Maria|2020}} His great-grandson Coleman Finchum, son of Hank Williams III, released his debut single credited to IV and the Strange Band in 2021.{{sfn|Harmon, Bryce|2021}} Meanwhile, Lewis Fitzgerald's son Ricky billed himself as Hank Williams IV following his father's claim of being Williams's son.{{sfn|Savingcountrymusic.com|2021}}

According to reportage in the Los Angeles Times, on his road trips Williams carried a brown leather briefcase containing notebooks in which he wrote musings, lines and verses of song lyrics, as well as jottings on whatever had been handy. After he died, the cache of sixty-six unpublished songs in four notebooks was stored in a fireproof vault at the Nashville offices of his publishing firm, Acuff-Rose Publications. The vault was moved in 2002 to the offices of Sony ATV Music when it acquired Acuff-Rose.{{sfn|Lewis, Randy|2011}}

After the 2001 tribute album, "Hank Williams: Timeless" won a Grammy Award for country album of the year, there was heightened interest in similar projects. [[A&R]] executive Mary Martin, one of the producers of "Timeless", was consulted about other means of drawing attention to material from the Williams archive. She said that Bob Dylan was given the first opportunity to perform 12 songs for a CD compilation. Dylan approached Williams's granddaughter Holly Williams at a show where he gave her a sheaf of song lyrics he wanted her to read. She later said that although Dylan had said nothing about them at first, she recognized them immediately as her grandfather's work. He then said he had been asked to possibly cut an entire album, or that he might have other artists perform them. She heard nothing more about it for two years until Mary Martin revived the project and she got a phone call from her publishing company saying it was time for her to pick up some samples of the available material.{{sfn|Talbott, Chris|2011}}

Consequently, several other musicians got involved in the project, their main task being to create music that suited the lyrics. Dylan chose a song called "The Love That Faded" and fashioned a "honky-tonk waltz through heartache", while Holly Williams combed through the songs and songs fragments and chose one called "Blue Is My Heart", which had only eight lines. She wrote two more and added a bridge. The completed album,  named ''[[The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams]]'',  included the contributions of Bob Dylan and Holly Williams, as well as recordings by [[Alan Jackson]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], [[Jakob Dylan]],{{sfn|Lewis, Randy|2011}} [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Levon Helm]], [[Sheryl Crow]], and [[Merle Haggard]]. The album was released on October 4, 2011.

Material recorded by Williams, originally intended for radio broadcasts to be played when he was on tour or for its distribution to radio stations nationwide, resurfaced over the years.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=153–154}} In 1993, a double-disc set of recordings of Williams for the ''Health & Happiness Show'' was released.{{sfn|Hinckley, David|1993|p=58}} Broadcast in 1949, the shows were recorded for the promotion of Hadacol. The set was re-released on ''Hank Williams: The Legend Begins'' in 2011. The album included the unreleased songs "Fan It" and "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]", recorded by Williams at age 15; the homemade recordings of him singing "Freight Train Blues", "[[New San Antonio Rose]]", "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]" and "Greenback Dollar" at age 18; and a recording for the 1951 [[March of Dimes]].{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|2011b}}

In May 2014, further radio recordings by Williams were released. These were recordings of ''[[The Garden Spot Programs, 1950]]'', a series of publicity segments for plant nursery Naughton Farms originally aired in 1950. The recordings were found by collector George Gimarc at radio station [[KSIB (AM)|KSIB]] in [[Creston, Iowa]].{{sfn|Mansfield, Brian|2014}} Gimarc contacted Williams's daughter Jett, and [[Colin Escott]], a music historian and biographer of Williams. The material was restored and remastered by [[Michael Graves (audio engineer)|Michael Graves]] and released by [[Omnivore Recordings]].{{sfn|Vigeland, Tess|2014}}{{sfn|Elliot, Gwendolyn|2014}} The release won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album|Best Historical Album]].{{sfn|Stefano, Angela|2015}}

Williams was portrayed by English actor [[Tom Hiddleston]] in the 2016 biopic ''[[I Saw the Light (film)|I Saw the Light]]'', based on Colin Escott's 1994 book ''Hank Williams: The Biography''.{{sfn|Michaels, Sean|2014}} In 2023, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Williams at No. 30 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2023}} For the 100th anniversary of his birth, the Hank Williams Museum organized a three-day event in Montgomery that consisted of a series of concerts at the Davis Theater at [[Troy University]] and a wreath-laying ceremony at Williams's graveside as the closing event.{{sfn|WSFA|2023}} At the ceremony, September 17, 2023, was proclaimed Hank Williams Day.{{sfn|Avant, Julia|2023}} Meanwhile, in Nashville, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum organized a concert featuring artists including [[Rodney Crowell]] and Williams's grandchildren Holly, Hillary, and Sam among others.{{sfn|Sauter, Danica|2023}} On the anniversary, ''Billboard'' commented that Williams was a "breakthrough songwriter" who "remains a mythological figure".{{sfn|Roland, Tom|2023}}

===Lawsuits over the estate===
Williams died without leaving a will. In May 1953, Audrey Williams filed a lawsuit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit demanded that both of the publishing companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams's records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams left no will, the disposition of the remaining 50 percent was considered uncertain; those involved included Williams's second wife, [[Billie Jean Horton]] and Williams's mother and sister.{{sfn|Billboard staff|1953b|p=15}}

At the time of his death, Williams's estate was estimated to be US$13,329.25 ({{Inflation|US|13329.25|1953|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) between cash, a cashier's check and his possessions.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=233}} Lilly Williams considered the legality of Billie Jean's marriage to her son doubtful and she filed for the control of the estate.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=234}} Billie Jean's lawyer argued that although she married Williams ten days before the finalization of her divorce to Harrison Eshlimar, Louisiana law considered the union legal since she married "in good faith".{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|pp=234-235}}

Doubtful of the legality of the marriage in Tennessee and Alabama, Lilly Williams and her lawyers made several offers to settle out of court with Billie Jean that reached a final of US$30,000.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} On August 19, 1953, Billie Jean signed an agreement accepting the money. It required that she stopped making appearances billing herself as "Mrs. Hank Williams", to reveal the location of Williams's [[Tennessee Walking Horse]], and the return of a saddle and three suitcases that belonged to him. With the agreement, Lilly became the legal guardian of the estate on behalf of Hank Williams, Jr.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=288}}

Soon after giving birth, Bobbie Jett left her and Williams's daughter at Lilly's boardinghouse. Williams's mother expressed to the Montgomery County Department of Public Welfare in January 1953 her intention to adopt the child. While Irene Williams opposed the adoption, Williams's mother was granted the custody over the child she renamed "Cathy".{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|pp=285-286}} However, upon Lilly's death in 1955, Irene Williams assumed control of the estate.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} She became thus the legal guardian of Williams's son, while refusing to adopt Cathy. Irene made an attempt to contact the girl's mother, Bobbie Jett, who was at the time married and lived in California. Jett refused to take the child since her husband did not know of the existence of her daughter with Williams.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=289}} Cathy was then put up for adoption and granted money from the estate of Lilly Williams, to be paid at the age of 21.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=290}}

In 1963, Wesley Rose contacted Irene regarding the copyright renewals with Acuff-Rose: Rose offered US$25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1963|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}),{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=85}} which Irene accepted to prevent Williams's daughter from making a claim in the future.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=293}} In 1966, an Alabama judge determined that the guardianship of Williams's estate belonged to Irene Williams, and he confirmed the validity of the copyright renewal deal. Cathy's adoptive parents were contacted by a lawyer, but they refused to contest the ruling of the court.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=294}} In 1967, Hank Williams, Jr. was declared the only heir to the estate by a second judge.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=87}} In 1969, the guardianship of the estate was transferred to lawyer Robert Stewart after Irene was arrested and sentenced to a jail term for possession of cocaine by a Texas court.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M.|1981|p=235}} Hank Williams, Jr. reached legal adulthood in 1970.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2009|p=293}}

On October 22, 1975, a federal judge in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, ruled that Billie Jean Horton was Williams's common-law wife, and that part of the copyright renewals of the songs belonged to her.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|p=87}} At the age of 21, Cathy learned that Hank Williams was her biological father. In 1981, she found her half-siblings in California, and she learned of a 1951 contract between her biological parents that recognized her as Williams's daughter. She also learned that the court decisions of the 1960s ignored her existence. After a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]] in 1989, she was recognized as an heir of the estate of Williams. She later changed her name to Jett Williams.{{sfn|Koon, George William|2001|pp=89-90}}

====WSM's ''Mother's Best Flour''====
In 1951, Williams hosted a 15-minute show for ''Mother's Best Flour'' on WSM radio. Due to Williams's tour schedules, some of the shows were previously recorded to be played in his absence.{{sfn|Hilbourn, Robert|2008}} During the mid-1960s, WSM staff photographer Les Leverett rescued acetates that were thrown away by the station.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}} At a later point, the recordings were duplicated.{{sfn|Ragogna, Mike|2010}} In the 1980s, he shared the acetates with Williams's former band member Jerry Rivers. A decade later, Leverett made a deal with former Drifting Cowboy Hillous Brutum, who did not appear on the recordings, for a commercial release of the copies.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}}

The Legacy Entertainment Group, based in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]], was sued by [[PolyGram]] and the heirs of Williams to block the release in 1997. While the original acetates of the shows made their way to the possession of Jett Williams, the lawyer of Legacy Entertainment Group claimed that they belonged to the label and he made an attempt to prevent the heirs of Williams to work on their own release of the recordings. Leverett then told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that the original acetates did not belong to Butrum, and that the two of them made a deal to share the profits of the planned Legacy Entertainment Group release.{{sfn|Underwood, Ryan|2006|p=2A}} The [[Universal Music Group]], the parent company of Polygram, then claimed ownership of the shows.{{sfn|Ragogna, Mike|2010}}

In January 2006, the [[Tennessee Court of Appeals]] upheld a lower court ruling stating that Williams's heirs—son, [[Hank Williams Jr]], and daughter, [[Jett Williams]]—have the sole rights to sell his recordings.{{sfn|AP staff|2006}} In 2008, [[Time-Life]] released ''Unreleased Recordings'', a selection of numbers pertaining to the ''Mother's Best Flour'' shows. In 2010, the company released a 15-CD box-set containing all of the recordings remastered by sound engineer Joe Palmaccio entitled ''The Complete Mothers' Best Recordings... Plus!''.{{sfn|Hyperbolium|2010}}

'''Hayden Thompson''' (born March 5, 1938) is an American singer, songwriter, and [[rockabilly]] musician.<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|page=442}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/HaydenThompson1.html |title=Hayden Thompson |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-02 |archive-date=October 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020062502/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/HaydenThompson1.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Thompson was born in [[Booneville, Mississippi]], United States.<ref name="Larkin50"/> At high school Thompson formed the Southern Melody Boys, who made a recording which led from a radio session. "I Feel the Blues Coming On" was sung by Thompson and gave them another radio appearance on the "[[Louisiana Hayride]]" show. Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  "Love My Baby" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Thompson's recording of "$16.88" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name="Larkin50"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades. These included ''The Time Is Now'' (1990).<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Born in the Netherlands, Intveld's parents moved to California when he was one year old.<ref name=homer/> James Intveld began entering talent contests as a [[country music]]-singing teenager at the Palomino Club located in [[North Hollywood, California]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kasten|first=Roy|title=Interview: Rockabilly Hall-of-Famer James Intveld|url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2009/01/interview_rockabilly_james_intveld_johnny_depp_crybaby_st_louis_nashville_blasters_la_ricky_nelson.php|work=Riverfront Times|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

Intveld originally played in The Rockin' Shadows with his brother Ricky Intveld.  The group disbanded when Ricky and bassist Patrick Woodward were asked by [[Ricky Nelson]] to join his backing band, the Stone Canyon Band. Both Intveld's brother and Patrick Woodward were killed in the 1985 [[Death of Ricky Nelson|plane crash]] which also took Nelson's life.

The Rockin’ Shadows had recorded Intveld’s song "My Heart Is Achin' For You" for the 1983 compilation album ''(Art Fein Presents) The Best of L.A. Rockabilly''.

As a songwriter, Intveld wrote "Crying Over You" recorded by [[Rosie Flores]] and released on her 1987 self-titled album. The aforementioned "My Heart Is Achin' For You" was covered by [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Dave Alvin]] on Burgess’ 1992 comeback album, ''Tennessee Border''.

Intveld played lead guitar for [[The Blasters]] from 1993 until leaving the band amicably in late 1995 to pursue his own projects, including acting and a solo album which would be released in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blasters News|url=http://www.davealvin.com/blasters/brnewsold.html#James|website=Davealvin.com|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

In 1995, Intveld released a solo album on Bear Family Records, ''Introducing James Intveld''. Tracks included "Perfect World", "Blue Blue Day", "Cryin' Over You", "I'm To Blame", "Barely Hangin' On", "Samantha", "Your Lovin'", "You Say Goodnight, I'll Say Goodbye", "Kermit Vale", and "Wild Places".

In 2000, he released the album ''Somewhere Down The Road'' on Molenaart Records. Tracks included "Somewhere Down The Road", "Stringin' Me On", "All The Way From Memphis", "Love Calls", "One Sweet Letter", "Living Without You", "Stop The World", "Modern Don Juan", "What About You", "If I Should Lose You", "A Sinner’s Prayer", and "Remember Me". "Sinner’s Prayer" and "Remember Me" were included on the 2006 soundtrack for ''Choppertown: The Sinners'', along with two other tracks that had not appeared on Intveld’s previous albums. A second volume of the Choppertown soundtrack, ''From the Vaults'', included Intveld’s recording "Kermit Vale," which had appeared on his 1995 album.

He contributed lead vocals to a few records by blues guitarist [[Kid Ramos]]: "I Would Be A Sinner" on Ramos’ 1999 eponymous release, and "Love Don’t Love Nobody" on 2000’s ''West Coast House Party.''

For the 2002 [[Johnny Cash]] tribute album ''Dressed in Black'', Intveld contributed a cover of the classic "[[Folsom Prison Blues]]."

In 2008, he released ''Have Faith'' on the Molenaart label, with the tracks "Pretty World", "This Place Ain´t What It Used To Be", "Let´s Get Started", "Something You Can´t Buy", "A Woman´s Touch", "Have Faith", "Motel Time", "If Tears Could Talk", "Small Town Boy", and "Walk With Me".

The 2013 Carla Olson album ''Have Harmony, Will Travel'' featured Intveld's song "Stringin' Me On." He plays guitar on three tracks on the album and sings a duet on [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Love's Made a Fool of You]]."

==Acting==
Intveld was in the 1984 film ''[[Roadhouse 66]]'', performing a song at the said roadhouse, acting alongside [[Willem Dafoe]].

Intveld has appeared in a number of films, mostly in smaller, supporting roles such as co-starring with [[Billy Bob Thornton]] in ''Chrystal''. Intveld lent his vocals to the titular character in John Waters' 1990 film ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (with Cry-Baby being played onscreen by [[Johnny Depp]]), though left out of the main credits for this role, he is credited as the vocalist for all songs "performed" by the character. Intveld also appears in the [[George Strait]] music video, "[[The Seashores of Old Mexico]]". Intveld appeared in [[The Thing Called Love]] Movie as a backing singer to [[River Phoenix]]’s character.

In 2005, Intveld turned from acting to directing in the form of ''Miracle at Sage Creek'', starring [[David Carradine]]. He had previously directed a music video for [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]].

He appeared in the 2000 TV mini-series ''[[The Beach Boys: An American Family]]'', portraying [[Hal Blaine]].

'''Janis Darlene Martin''' (March 27, 1940 &ndash; September 3, 2007) was an American [[rockabilly]] and [[country music]] singer. She was one of the few women working in the male-dominated rock and roll music field during the 1950s and one of country music's early female innovators. Martin was nicknamed the Female Elvis for her dance moves on stage, similar to those of [[Elvis Presley]].

==Biography==
{{More citations needed |date=June 2018}}

===Early life and rise to fame===
Martin was born in [[Sutherlin, Virginia]], east of [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]. Her mother was a stage mother, and her father and uncle were both musicians. Before she was six, Martin was already singing and playing the guitar, inspired by [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Hank Williams]]. 
Over the years, this resulted in statewide contests with over 200 contestants, which she won. As a result, Janis was asked to play on the same bill as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Sunshine Sue]].  Through them Martin became a member of the [[Old Dominion Barn Dance|Old Dominion Barndance]] on [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]], which came out of Richmond every Saturday Night on CBS network. When she was in her mid-teens, she was appearing with country singers including Arnold, [[Hank Snow]], [[The Browns]] and [[Jim Reeves]].  She soon claimed she was tired of country music and began a rock and roll career.

===Teen rock and roll star===
The WRVA station announcer, Carl Stutz, wrote a song titled "Will You Willyum", and asked Martin to sing the song live on stage that Saturday night so that he could make a demo tape to send to his publisher in New York. A week later, Stutz called Martin to tell her that [[RCA Victor]] was interested in recording "Will You Willyum". As it happened, the publisher offered "Will You Willyum" to [[Steve Sholes]], a producer at RCA Victor, and asked whether Sholes had an artist to record it. Apparently Sholes replied "Well, who's the girl doin' the demo?"

At age 15, Martin signed with RCA Victor in March 1956, just two months after Elvis Presley joined the label. She recorded "Will You Willyum" on March 8, 1956, backed by her own composition "Drugstore Rock 'n Roll".

The song became the biggest hit of her career, selling 750,000 records. Soon Martin was performing on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]''. She also appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'', and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming one of the younger performers to ever appear. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her Most Promising Female Vocalist that year.

Presley and RCA were so impressed with Martin's stage presence that they dubbed her the Female Elvis.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 7, 1956 |title=Review spotlight on... |pages=44 |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=janis+martin+female+elvis&pg=PA44 |access-date=March 29, 2022}}</ref><ref>[[Sun Records]] also dubbed [[Jean Chapel]] the female Elvis Presley in 1956 when she began recording rockabilly songs including "I Won't Be Rocking Tonight".</ref> Presley sent a dozen red roses to her when she appeared at the RCA Victor convention in [[Miami, Florida]]. [[Colonel Tom Parker]], Elvis' manager, offered to take over her management seeing the potential of a successful double "boy-girl" bill. Just before, due to his extremely taxing touring schedule, Elvis had collapsed on stage in New York due to exhaustion. Safeguarding the young Janis Martin from this, her parents decided to not accept Parker's offer, and instead go with the head of the Old Dominion shows. RCA chose Martin to tour as a member of the [[Jim Reeves]] show and continued recording rock and roll and country material that ended up being successful on both charts, including "My Boy Elvis", "Let's Elope Baby", her cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s song "[[Ooby Dooby]]", and "[[Love Me to Pieces]]".

On January 7, 1956, Martin eloped with her boyfriend, a paratrooper. She told her parents of her marriage only after her husband was safely shipped overseas in Germany. Her father tried to have it annulled because she was only 15 years old. Eventually, the matter was left, but Janis' mother ordered her to keep her marriage a secret to safeguard her career. In 1957, Janis went on a [[USO]] tour in Europe with [[Jim Reeves]], [[Del Wood]] (a pianist famous for performing the song "Down Yonder"), [[The Browns]], and [[Hank Locklin]]. Her husband got a 30-day leave and went on the road with her, which resulted in her getting pregnant with her son. Martin's teenage pregnancy caused RCA Victor to drop her in 1958. It was probably during this period that a 10" LP album titled ''Janis and Elvis'' was released in South Africa. This was recalled immediately upon request from the U.S. because it suggested the idea that the two performers were singing together. Although [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] and [[Decca Records]] were interested, she signed with the Belgian label [[Palette Records|Palette]] in 1960.

===Later career===
By 1960, Martin was on her second marriage, and her husband demanded she leave the music business. In the 1970s, she began performing again with her newly formed band, The Variations. In 1975, she was working for the [[Halifax, Virginia]], Police Department when music historian Dennis West tracked her down. Edd Bayes, a record collector from Maryland, asked Dennis for her address, which Dennis gave to him. He then coaxed her to appear locally and tell her story in ''Goldmine'' magazine. Martin toured through Europe as part of the rockabilly revival there, and in 1979 Bayes convinced RCA to pull four Martin songs from their vault, which were then released on [[Dog Gone Records]] in 1977. Edd Bayes took one of the songs that had been recorded twice ("Love Me Love") at different tempos and added the 'cha cha' to the title. In the 1980s, the [[Bear Family]] label gathered Martin's complete record history with the compilation album ''The Female Elvis''. Since the early 1980s Janis started performing again at Rockabilly shows through Europe and the US. One of her live shows was released on a CD called ''Here I Am'' on [[Hydra Records]].  In 1995, Martin appeared on [[Rosie Flores]]'s ''Rockabilly Filly'' album for [[HighTone Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockabilly Filly Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263|website=AllMusic.com|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Flores recorded an album with Martin six months before her death, but it was not released until September 18, 2012, as [[The Blanco Sessions]] by [[Cow Island Music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Janis Martin, 'The Female Elvis,' Returns|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/30/161968431/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-returns|website=NPR Music|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Flores|first1=Rosie|title=JANIS MARTIN " The Female Elvis", Final Recording Sessions|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1383637978/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-final-recording-sess|website=Kickstarter|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref>

===Death===
Martin died from cancer on September 3, 2007, at [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Her only son, Kevin Parton, had died that January.

==Honors==
In 2010 the [[Library of Virginia]] posthumously honored Martin as a [[Virginia Women in History]] because of her musical career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Women in History: Janis Martin|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2010/honoree.asp?bio=8|publisher=Library of Virginia|access-date=4 March 2015}}</ref>

'''Jerry Lee Lewis''' (September 29, 1935{{snd}}October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer and songwriter. Nicknamed "'''The Killer'''", he was described as "[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. "[[Crazy Arms]]" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", "[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]", and "[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]".

His rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]] and had hits with songs such as "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321082649/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |url-status=live }}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included "[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]", "[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]", "[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]", and "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]".

Lewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s "Rockin' My Life Away". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.

Lewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Music Hall of Fame |url=http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |access-date=October 12, 2016 |website=Memphismusichalloffame.com |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009220210/http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022.

Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said of Lewis: "His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable [[boogie]]-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of [[The Void (philosophy)|the void]] make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller."<ref name="Christgau"/>

==Early life==
Jerry Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, to Elmo Kidd Lewis Sr. and Mary "Mamie" Herron Lewis in [[Ferriday, Louisiana]]. He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular televangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon – Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday. The hit of his set was his performance of [[R&B]] artist [[Stick McGhee]]'s "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Palmer |first=Robert |date=December 13, 1979 |title=The Devil and Jerry Lee Lewis |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-devil-and-jerry-lee-lewis-2-179111/ |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620171628/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-devil-and-jerry-lee-lewis-2-179111/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On the live album ''By Request, More of the Greatest Live Show on Earth'', Lewis is heard naming [[Moon Mullican]] as an artist who inspired him.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{Cite web |title=Moon Mullican {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=AllMusic |archive-date=August 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210804185528/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moon-mullican-mn0000594267/biography |url-status=live }}</ref>

His mother enrolled him at the [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University|Southwest Bible Institute]] in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], so that he could sing evangelical songs exclusively. When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of "My God Is Real" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some "worldly" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. After that incident, he went home and started playing at clubs in and around Ferriday and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], becoming part of the burgeoning new [[rock and roll]] sound and cutting his first demo recording in 1952 for [[Cosimo Matassa]] in New Orleans.<ref name=jms>{{Cite web |last=Halsey |first=Jay |year=2021 |title=The Killer Rocks J&M |url=http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |website=The Cosimo Code |access-date=October 29, 2022 |archive-date=September 2, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220902142443/http://cosimocode.com/killer.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tomko|first=Gene|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Louisiana Musicians: Jazz, Blues, Cajun, Creole, Zydeco, Swamp Pop, and Gospel|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2020|isbn=978-0807169322|location=Baton Rouge|pages=160|access-date=December 1, 2021|archive-date=July 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173501/https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Around 1955, he traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he played in clubs and attempted to build interest, but was turned down by the [[Grand Ole Opry]], as he was already at the [[Louisiana Hayride]] country stage and radio show in [[Shreveport]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2012 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 21, 2021 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204174946/https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Career==
===J&M Studio===
Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s [[J&M Recording Studio]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. He covered [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s "Don't Stay Away (Till Love Grows Cold)" and his own instrumental composition "Jerry's Boogie" ({{aka}} New Orleans Boogie).<ref name=jms/>

===Sun Records===

[[File:GreenbackDollar.ogg|right|thumb|[[Sun Records]] artist [[Ray Harris]] singing the song "Greenback Dollar", with Lewis playing the piano]]
In November 1956, Lewis traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to audition for [[Sun Records]]. Label owner [[Sam Phillips]] was in Florida, but producer and engineer [[Jack Clement]] recorded Lewis's rendition of [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]'s "[[Crazy Arms]]" and his own composition "[[End of the Road (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|End of the Road]]". In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's "[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]", "[[Your True Love]]", and "Put Your Cat Clothes On" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s "Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll".

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. Johnny Cash was also there watching Perkins. The four then started an impromptu [[jam session]] and Phillips left the tape running.<ref name=pc8 /> These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, were released on CD as ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's "[[Don't Be Cruel]]" and "[[Paralyzed (Elvis Presley song)|Paralyzed]]", [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Brown Eyed Handsome Man]]", and [[Pat Boone]]'s "Don't Forbid Me".
[[File:Great Balls of Fire - You Win Again - Cash Box ad 1957.jpg|thumb|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' advertisement, November 16, 1957]] 
Lewis's own singles (on which he was billed as "Jerry Lee Lewis And His Pumping Piano") advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]", a [[Big Maybelle]] cover, and "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", his biggest hit, bringing him international fame and criticism of the songs, which prompted some radio stations to boycott them. In 2005, "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. According to several first-hand sources, including [[Johnny Cash]], Lewis, a devout Christian, was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he believed was leading him and his audience to [[Hell]].<ref>Cash, Johnny (1997). ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. p. 98.</ref> This aspect of Lewis's character was depicted in [[Waylon Payne]]'s portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', based on Cash's autobiographies.

As part of his stage act, Lewis pounded the keys with his heel, kicked the [[piano bench]] aside and played standing, raking his hands up and down the keys, sat on the keyboard and stood on the piano. He told ''the [[Pop Chronicles]]'' that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act.<ref name="pc8">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19756/m1/ |title=Show 8 – The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the Rock-a-Billies.

His dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'' (he sang the title song from the back of a [[flatbed truck]]), and ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''. [[Cub Koda]] called him "rock & roll's first great wild man" and also "rock & roll's first great eclectic".<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Cub |last1=Koda |author-link=Cub Koda |editor-last=Bogdanov |editor-first=Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd |title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music |publisher=Backbeat Books |year=2001 |isbn=9780879306274 |location=San Francisco |page=[https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd/page/234 234] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Classical composer [[Michael Nyman]] has also cited Lewis's style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.<ref>[[Andrew Ford (composer)|Andrew Ford]].

In 1960, Phillips opened a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sam Phillips: The Sound and Legacy of Sun Records |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2001/nov/phillips/011128.sam.phillips.html |access-date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=npr.org |archive-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016031755/http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2001/nov/phillips/011128.sam.phillips.html |url-status=live }}</ref> abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Carl Perkins]], Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]], and others, and also opened a studio in [[Nashville]]. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of [[Ray Charles]]'s "[[What'd I Say]]" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of "[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]" (September 1962 UK) and "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]" (March 1963) entered the [[hit parade]]. On popular EPs, "Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes", "I've Been Twistin{{'"}}, "Money", and "Hello Josephine" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent [[discothèque]]s. Another recording of Lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]]'s "[[In the Mood]]" was issued on the [[Phillips International Records|Phillips International]] label under the pseudonym "The Hawk".<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2012 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis {{!}} Sun Record Company |url=https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 22, 2021 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204174946/https://www.sunrecords.com/artists/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Marriage controversy===
Lewis's turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a May 1958 British tour where Ray Berry, a news agency reporter at London's [[Heathrow Airport]] (the only journalist present), learned about Lewis's third wife, Myra Gale Brown. She is Lewis's first cousin once removed<ref>{{Cite web |last=Devin Miller |date=April 17, 1998 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis Online Wild One's Clubhouse: The Largest Jerry Lee Lewis Homepage on the Internet! |url=http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Jerry9.tripod.com |archive-date=June 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623135413/http://jerry9.tripod.com/Myra.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cecil Adams |date=October 1, 2004 |title=What's wrong with cousins marrying? |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041001.html |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=The Straight Dope |archive-date=May 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526033048/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041001.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><!-- DO NOT CHANGE COUSIN STATEMENT - SEE TALK PAGE --> and was 13 years old when they married—though Lewis, who was 22 years old at the time, claimed she was actually 15.

===Smash Records===
Lewis's Sun recording contract ended in 1963, and he joined [[Smash Records]], where he made several rock recordings that did not further his career. The team at Smash (a division of [[Mercury Records]]) came up with "I'm on Fire", a song that they felt would be perfect for Lewis and, as [[Colin Escott]] writes in the sleeve to the retrospective ''A Half Century of Hits'', "Mercury held the presses, thinking they had found Lewis's comeback hit, and it might have happened if [[the Beatles]] hadn't arrived in America, changing radio playlists almost overnight. Mercury didn't really know what to do with Lewis after that."<ref name="Escott">{{citation|title=A Half Century Of Hits|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/A_Half_Century_Of_Hits.html|type=CD liner|date=January 2006|author=Colin Escott|publisher=[[Time Life]]|access-date=October 30, 2022|archive-date=April 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420104332/http://albumlinernotes.com/A_Half_Century_Of_Hits.html|url-status=live}}</ref> One of Smash's first decisions was to record a retread of his Sun hits, ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm European fans had shown for Lewis's firebrand rock and roll. In June 1963, Lewis returned to the UK for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier, to headline a performance on the ''[[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV Royal Daffodil]]'', for a [[English Channel|cross-channel]] rock and roll cruise from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend, Essex]], to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne, France]]. For this performance, he was backed by [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[The Outlaws (band)|the Outlaws]].<ref name="Bloom2009">{{Cite book |last=Jerry Bloom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5 |title=Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore |date=November 5, 2009 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=978-0-85712-053-3 |pages=100 |access-date=March 10, 2020 |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173507/https://books.google.com/books?id=1f53kihTyRMC&pg=PA100-IA5 |url-status=live }}</ref> None of Lewis's early Smash albums, including ''[[The Return of Rock]]'', ''[[Memphis Beat]]'', and ''[[Soul My Way]]'', were commercial successes.

===''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg''===
One major success during these lost years was the concert album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'', recorded with [[the Nashville Teens]] in 1964, which is considered one of the greatest live albums ever.<ref name="Checksfield">Checksfield, Peter (1995).

The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, "Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll..." The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that "''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion."

===Country comeback===
[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]
Frustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the [[Jerry Chesnut]] song "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 "looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956." The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with "Pen and Paper" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but "Another Place, Another Time" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.

Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", "To Make Love Sweeter For You", "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", "Since I Met You Baby", "Once More With Feeling", "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick "[[Nashville sound]]" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".

In a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, "[[One Minute Past Eternity]]", was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit "She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye". Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.

===Grand Ole Opry appearance===
Lewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', he had maintained an ambivalence to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: "It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't [[schmooze]] there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different."<ref name="Escott"/>

As recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single "[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]". Ignoring his allotted time constraints—and, thus, commercial breaks—Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]—the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager—out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On", "Workin' Man Blues", "Good Golly, Miss Molly", and a number of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021172629/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===
[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]
Lewis returned to the pop charts with "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]" in 1971 and "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut "Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee" was the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' was his highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, "the Killer" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: "During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog." During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, "Do you wanna try one?", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, "If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=The Vinyl District |archive-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115110247/http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was "Middle Age Crazy", which made it to number 4 in 1977.

===Later career===
[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]
In 1979, Lewis switched record labels to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.

In 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called "It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts. Lewis and Swaggart had a complex relationship over the years.

Receiving positive reviews, the album charted on four different Billboard charts, including a two-week stay at number one on the Indie charts. A DVD entitled ''[[Last Man Standing Live]]'', featuring concert footage with many guest artists, was released in March 2007.

In October 2008, as part of a successful European tour, Lewis appeared at two London shows: a special private show at the [[100 Club]] on October 25, and at the [[London Forum]] on October 28 with [[Wanda Jackson]] and his sister, [[Linda Gail Lewis]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=londonrocknroll.com |url=http://ww5.londonrocknroll.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801192449/http://www.londonrocknroll.com/ |archive-date=August 1, 2015 |website=Londonrocknroll.com}}</ref> In August 2009, in advance of his new album, a single entitled "[[Mean Old Man]]" was released for download.

In June 1989, Lewis was honored for his contribution to the recording industry with a star along [[Hollywood Boulevard]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. On October 10, 2007, Lewis received the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's American Music Masters Award. His next album, ''[[Mean Old Man (album)|Mean Old Man]]'', was released in September 2010 and reached No. 30 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

On November 5, 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, honored Lewis with six days of conferences, interviews, a DVD premiere, and film clips, dedicated to him and entitled ''The Life And Music of Jerry Lee Lewis''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=https://www.classicbands.com/jerrylee.html |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=Classicbands.com |archive-date=April 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423140656/http://www.classicbands.com/jerrylee.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On November 10, the week culminated with a tribute concert compered by [[Kris Kristofferson]].

===Piano style===
Lewis was an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Robert Fontenot |date=March 4, 2019 |title=Did Jerry Lee Lewis Really Set His Pianos on Fire Onstage? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/jerry-lee-lewis-setting-his-pianos-on-fire-on-stage-2523388 |access-date=October 1, 2019 |website=Thoughtco.com |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417065338/https://www.thoughtco.com/jerry-lee-lewis-setting-his-pianos-on-fire-on-stage-2523388 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style became synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players.

In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, [[Elton John]] recalls that up until "Great Balls of Fire", "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. My dad collected [[George Shearing]] records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." Lewis was primarily known for his "[[boogie-woogie]]" style, which is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. Appearing on ''Memphis Sounds with [[George Klein (disc jockey)|George Klein]]'' in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice-looking man, carried himself real well. I miss Carl very much." Lewis also cited [[Moon Mullican]] as a source of inspiration.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Episode 59: "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" by Jerry Lee Lewis - A History Of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs |url=https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1437402802/a-history-of-rock-music-in-five-hundred-songs/episode-59-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on-by-jerry-lee-lewis |access-date=March 21, 2021 |website=Poddtoppen |language=sv |archive-date=September 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922062821/https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1437402802/a-history-of-rock-music-in-five-hundred-songs/episode-59-whole-lotta-shakin-goin-on-by-jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lewis's second marriage to Sally Jane Mitcham in September 1953, was of dubious validity because it occurred 23 days before his divorce from Barton was final. They had two children: Jerry Lee Lewis Jr. (1954–1973) and Ronnie Guy Lewis (b. 1956). After four years, he filed for divorce in October 1957.

===Religious beliefs===
As a teenager, Lewis studied at the Southwest Bible Institute in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], before being thrown out for playing a 'worldly' [[boogie-woogie]] version of "My God Is Real", and that early incident foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing "the devil's music". Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous ("How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because "only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]", and {{"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words... they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October–November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>

In the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, "The Bible doesn't even speak of religion. No word of religion is even in the Bible. ''Sanctification!'' Are you sanctified? Have you been ''saved''? See, I was a good preacher, I know my Bible? I find myself falling short of the glory of God."

Gospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire. After a string of hit country albums, he recorded [[In Loving Memories: The Jerry Lee Lewis Gospel Album|a gospel album]] for the first time in 1970 (it was released in 1971).<ref>{{Citation |title=Jerry Lee Lewis - In Loving Memories Album Reviews, Songs & More |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/in-loving-memories-mr0002561399 |work=AllMusic |language=en |access-date=October 30, 2022 |archive-date=October 30, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221030134931/https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/in-loving-memories-mr0002561399 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lewis replied that he would if he had time, but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in [[Tunica, Mississippi|Tunica]] for [[driving under the influence]]. Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.

Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but "Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The [[Memphis police]] found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs." Lewis said, "The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world. Presley himself died at Graceland nine months later.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tosches |first=Nick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |title=Country: The Twisted Roots Of Rock 'n' Roll |date=2009 |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=978-0-7867-5098-6 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713173511/https://books.google.com/books?id=ALrR8lHmv44C&pg=PT86 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=November 4, 2014 |title=The Killer at Peace: Jerry Lee Lewis' Golden Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |page=3 |access-date=October 14, 2019 |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818112008/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-killer-at-peace-jerry-lee-lewis-golden-years-47174/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerry Lee Lewis |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |website=The Smoking Gun |date=June 12, 2014 |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915081623/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/jerry-lee-lewis |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1988, Lewis filed for bankruptcy, petitioning that he was more than $3&nbsp;million in debt, including $2&nbsp;million he owed to the IRS.<ref name=":0" />

'''Jerry Reed Hubbard''' (March 20, 1937<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=2061/2}}</ref> – September 1, 2008),<ref name="nytobit"/> known professionally as '''Jerry Reed''', was an American [[Country music|country]] singer, guitarist, composer, songwriter and actor who appeared in more than a dozen films. His signature songs included "[[Guitar Man (Jerry Reed song)|Guitar Man]]", "[[U.S. Male]]", "[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]", "[[Alabama Wild Man (song)|Alabama Wild Man]]", "[[Amos Moses]]", "[[When You're Hot, You're Hot]]" (which garnered a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]]), "[[Ko-Ko Joe]]", "[[Lord, Mr. Ford]]", "[[East Bound and Down]]" (the theme song for the 1977 film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', in which Reed co-starred), "[[The Bird (Jerry Reed song)|The Bird]]", and "[[She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)]]".

Reed was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]]. He was announced as an inductee into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in April 2017 and he was officially inducted by [[Bobby Bare]] on October 24.<ref>{{cite news|last=Watts |first=Cindy |title=Alan Jackson, Jerry Reed, Don Schlitz tapped for Country Music Hall of Fame |url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2017/04/05/watch-live-2017-country-music-hall-fame-announcement/100065648/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]}}</ref>

==Early life==
Reed was born in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and was the second child of Robert and Cynthia Hubbard. Reed's grandparents lived in [[Rockmart, Georgia|Rockmart]] and he would visit them from time to time. As a small child running around strumming his guitar he is quoted as saying "I am gonna be a star. I'm gonna go to [[Nashville]] and be a star." Reed's parents separated four months after his birth; he and his sister spent seven years in [[foster home]]s or [[orphanage]]s growing up. Reed was reunited with his mother and stepfather in 1944.

Reed graduated from O'Keefe High School, an Atlanta city school. The O'Keefe building still exists today; it was sold to [[Georgia Tech]] and is now part of the university's campus. By high school, Reed was already writing and singing music, having learned to play the guitar as a child. At age 18, he was signed by publisher and record producer [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] to cut his first record, "[[If the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek Don't Rise]]".

At [[Capitol Records]] Reed was promoted as a new "teen-age sensation" after recording his own [[rockabilly]] composition "When I Found You" in 1956. He recorded both country and rockabilly singles and found success as a songwriter when label mate [[Gene Vincent]] covered his song "Crazy Legs" in 1958.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

By 1958, [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] signed Reed to his company, [[National Recording Corporation]]. He recorded for NRC as both an artist and as a member of the staff band which included [[Joe South]] and [[Ray Stevens]], other NRC artists.

Reed married [[Priscilla Mitchell|Priscilla "Prissy" Mitchell]] in 1959. They had two daughters, Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970. Mitchell was a member of folk group The Appalachians ("Bony Moronie", 1963), and with [[Roy Drusky]] was co-credited on the 1965 country No. 1 "[[Yes, Mr. Peters]]".

==Career==
In 1959, Reed hit the Billboard "Bubbling Under the Top 100", also known as the Roar and Cashbox Country chart with the single "Soldier's Joy". After serving two years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Reed moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1961 to continue his songwriting career, which had continued to gather steam while he was in the Army, thanks to [[Brenda Lee]]'s 1960 cover of his song "That's All You Got to Do".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He also became a popular session and tour guitarist.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1962, he scored some success with two singles "[[Goodnight Irene]]" (as by Jerry Reed & the Hully Girlies, featuring a female vocal group) and "Hully Gully Guitar",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which found their way to [[Chet Atkins]] at [[RCA Victor]], who produced Reed's 1965 "If I Don't Live Up to It".

==="Guitar Man"===
In July 1967, Reed had his best showing on the country chart (No. 53) with his self-penned "[[Guitar Man (Jerry Reed song)|Guitar Man]]", which [[Elvis Presley]] soon covered.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Reed's next single was "Tupelo Mississippi Flash", a comic tribute to Presley. Recorded on September 1, the song became his first [[Top 20]] hit, going to No. 15 on the chart. Coincidentally Presley came to Nashville to record nine days later on September 10, 1967, and one of the songs he became especially excited about was "Guitar Man".

Reed recalled how he was tracked down to play on the Presley session: "I was out on the [[Cumberland River]] fishing, and I got a call from [[Felton Jarvis]] (then Presley's producer at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]) He said, 'Elvis is down here. We've been trying to cut "Guitar Man" all day long. He wants it to sound like it sounded on your album.' I finally told him, 'Well, if you want it to sound like that, you're going have to get me in there to play guitar, because these guys [you're using in the studio] are [[Flatpicking|straight pickers]]. I [[fingerpicking|pick with my fingers]] and tune that guitar up all weird kind of ways.'"<ref name="tennessean">{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080902/TUNEIN/80902039|title='Bandit' star Reed dies at 71|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|date=September 2, 2008}}</ref>

Jarvis hired Reed to play on the session. "I hit that intro, and [Elvis's] face lit up and here we went. Then after he got through that, he cut [my] "[[U.S. Male]]" at the same session. I was toppin' cotton, son." Reed also played the guitar for Elvis Presley's [[Big Boss Man (song)|"Big Boss Man"]] (1967), recorded in the same session.<ref>Ernst Jorgensen, ''Elvis Presley: A Life in Music'' (St. Martin's Press, 1998), pp. 234–236</ref>

On January 15 and 16, 1968, Reed worked on a second Presley session, during which he played guitar on a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]", "Stay Away", and "Goin' Home" (two songs revolving around Presley's film ''[[Stay Away, Joe]]''), as well as another Reed composition, "U.S. Male" (Reed's quoted recollection of "U.S. Male" being recorded at the same session as "Guitar Man" being incorrect).<ref>Jorgensen, pp. 241–242</ref>

Presley also recorded two other Reed compositions: "[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]" in May 1971 for his [[He Touched Me (Elvis Presley album)|''He Touched Me'']] album, and "Talk About The Good Times" in December 1973, for a total of four.

[[Johnny Cash]] also released "[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]" as a single in 1971.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> It  reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Singles Chart for North America and was also successful in Europe. It became the title track for a studio [[A Thing Called Love|album]] that he released the following spring.

===1970s===
After releasing the 1970 crossover hit "[[Amos Moses]]", a hybrid of rock, country, funk, and Cajun styles which reached No. 8 on the U.S. pop chart,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Reed teamed with Atkins for the duet LP ''[[Me & Jerry]]'', which earned the pair the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]]. During the 1970 television season, he was a regular on ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', and in 1971 he released his biggest hit, the chart-topper "[[When You're Hot, You're Hot]]",<ref name="LarkinGE"/>KO buddy of the singer, who nevertheless sends him up the river for gambling. Aside from being a major crossover hit, "When You're Hot, You're Hot" earned Reed the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]].

"When You're Hot, You're Hot" was the title track of Reed's first solo album, reaching No. 9 Pop and No. 6 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart. The singles from the album, "Amos Moses" and "When You're Hot, You're Hot" sold over one million copies, and were awarded [[Music recording sales certification|gold discs]] by the [[RIAA]]<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/285 285 & 301] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/285 }}</ref> The album features songs such as Reed's version of "[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]" and [[John D.

A second collaboration with Atkins, ''[[Me & Chet]]'', followed in 1972 as did a series of Top 40 singles which alternated between frenetic, straightforward country offerings and more pop-flavored, [[countrypolitan]] material. A year later he scored his second number one single with "Lord, Mr. Ford" (written by [[Deena Kaye Rose]]), from the album of the same name.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Atkins, who frequently produced Reed's music, remarked that he had to encourage Reed to put instrumental numbers on his own albums, as Reed always considered himself more of a songwriter than a player. Atkins, however, thought Reed was a better [[fingerstyle]] player than he was himself; Reed, according to Atkins, helped him work out the fingerpicking for one of Atkins's biggest hits, "[[Yakety Sax]]".

Reed was featured in animated form in a December 9, 1972, episode of [[Hanna–Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', "The Phantom of the Country Music Hall" (prod. No. 61-10). He sang and played the song "Pretty Mary Sunlight". The song is played throughout the episode as Scooby and the gang search for Reed's missing guitar.

In the mid-1970s, Reed's recording career began to take a back seat to his acting aspirations.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1974, he co-starred with his close friend [[Burt Reynolds]] in the film ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> While he continued to record throughout the decade, his greatest visibility was as a motion picture star and almost always in tandem with headliner Reynolds; after 1976's ''[[Gator (film)|Gator]]'',<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Reed appeared in 1978's ''[[High-Ballin']]'' and 1979's ''[[Hot Stuff (1979 film)|Hot Stuff]]''. He also co-starred in all three of the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit (franchise)|Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films; the [[Smokey and the Bandit|first]], which premiered in 1977, landed Reed a No. 2 hit with the soundtrack's "East Bound and Down".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tassler |first=Mark|date=2016-08-25 |title=Story Behind the Song: 'Eastbound and Down' by Jerry Reed |url=https://kxrb.com/story-behind-the-song-eastbound-and-down-by-jerry-reed/ |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=KXRB 1140 AM/100.1 FM |language=en}}</ref>

In 1977, Reed joined entrepreneur [[Larry Schmittou]] and other country music stars including [[Conway Twitty]], [[Cal Smith]], [[Larry Gatlin]], and [[Richard Sterban]], as investors in the [[Nashville Sounds]], a [[minor league baseball]] team of the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Southern League (1964–2020)|Southern League]] that began play in 1978.<ref>{{citation|first=Larry|last=Woody|title=Schmittou: A Grand Slam in Baseball, Business, And Life|publisher=Eggmann Publishing Company|location=Nashville|year=1996|isbn=1886371334|pages=64–65}}</ref>

He made two guest appearances on the sitcom ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', in 1978 and 1981.

Reed also took a stab at hosting a TV variety show, filming two episodes of ''The Jerry Reed Show'' in 1976.

Scottish rockers [[The Sensational Alex Harvey Band]] released a version of "Amos Moses" in 1976.

In 1979, he released a record comprising both vocal and instrumental selections titled, appropriately enough, ''Half & Half''. It was followed one year later by ''Jerry Reed Sings [[Jim Croce]]'', a tribute to the late singer/songwriter. He also starred in a TV movie in that year entitled ''[[Concrete Cowboys (1979 film)|Concrete Cowboys]]''.

===1980s and 1990s===
In January 1980, Reed began work on the "Guitar Man" re-recording being produced by Presley's producer Felton Jarvis. With a new "hopped up" guitar line and Presley on lead vocals, the song reached number one on the country chart.

In 1982, Reed's career as a singles artist was revitalized by the chart-topping hit "[[She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)]]",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> followed by "[[The Bird (Jerry Reed song)|The Bird]]", which peaked at No. 2. Also in 1982, Reed headlined a syndicated TV special, ''Jerry Reed and Friends''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Collie |first=Biff |date=August 6, 1982 |title=Inside Nashville |url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Archive-RandR/1980s/1982/RR-1982-08-06.pdf |work=Radio & Records |pages=32}}</ref> The special, a "music filled celebrity picnic", was filmed at the [[Nashville Shores|Hermitage Landing]] TN.

His last chart hit, "I'm a Slave", appeared in 1983. In the same year he co-starred with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Walter Matthau]] in the [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] comedy ''[[The Survivors (1983 film)|The Survivors]]''. Reed guest-starred in the October 13, 1983, episode of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', "The Return of Leonard Oates" (Episode 13, Season 2), as Naomi Harper's ex-husband.

He accepted an invitation to open for the British group [[Dexys Midnight Runners]] in the US in 1984, yet left the tour early to appear on the country music comedy TV show ''[[Hee-Haw]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/usa |title=Jerry Reed |first=Garth |last=Cartwright |date=September 3, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

After an unsuccessful 1986 LP, ''Lookin' at You'', Reed focused on touring until 1992 when he and Atkins reunited for the album ''[[Sneakin' Around]]'' before he again returned to the road. In the meantime, Reed appeared in several interviews and commercial spots for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]].

Reed had a role as a commander/Huey pilot for [[Danny Glover]]'s character in the 1988 movie ''[[Bat*21]]'' starring [[Gene Hackman]]. He also acted as executive producer and screenwriter on this film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/bat-21-film |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

Reed starred in the 1998 [[Adam Sandler]] film ''[[The Waterboy]]'' as Red Beaulieu, the movie's chief antagonist and the head coach for the University of Louisiana Cougars football team. Actor [[Henry Winkler]] recounts that Reed taught him how to bass fish while on location for this movie.<ref> https://x.com/hwinkler4real/status/1774928469346169097 </ref>

He teamed up with country superstars [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Mel Tillis]], and [[Bobby Bare]] in the group [[Old Dogs (group)|Old Dogs]]. They recorded one album in 1998, entitled ''[[Old Dogs (album)|Old Dogs]]'', with songs written by [[Shel Silverstein]]. Reed sang lead on "Young Man's Job" and "Elvis Has Left The Building", the latter possibly in deference to Elvis helping launch his career.

In 1998, the American rock band [[Primus (band)|Primus]] covered the Reed song "Amos Moses" on the EP titled ''[[Rhinoplasty (album)|Rhinoplasty]]''.

===2000s===
In October 2004, "Amos Moses" was featured on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas#Soundtrack|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' soundtrack which played on the fictional radio station [[K-Rose]]. In 2007, the British band [[Alabama 3]] (known as A3 in the U.S.) covered his hit "Amos Moses" on their album, ''[[M.O.R. (album)|M.O.R.]]''

In June 2005, American guitarist [[Eric Johnson (guitarist, born 1954)|Eric Johnson]] released his album ''[[Bloom (Eric Johnson album)|Bloom]]'' which contained a track titled "Tribute to Jerry Reed" in commemoration of his works.

Reed appeared as a guest on the fishing television series ''[[Bill Dance Outdoors]]''. In one memorable appearance, Reed caught a particularly big [[largemouth bass]] and planned to have it preserved and mounted by a [[taxidermist]]. Host [[Bill Dance (television host)|Bill Dance]] objected to this plan and freed the fish when Reed was not looking. Reed became enraged when he discovered what had happened and chased Dance off the boat and to shore. This incident was mentioned in one of [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s stand-up comedy routines.

"She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)" was used in the 2010 film, ''[[The Bounty Hunter (2010 film)|The Bounty Hunter]]''. It plays during the scene where Milo ([[Gerard Butler]]) searches Nicole's ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) apartment.

"[[You Took All the Ramblin' Out of Me]]" was used in the 2013 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', on the radio station [[Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack#Rebel Radio|Rebel Radio]].

"Talk About the Good Times" was used as the opening theme for the 2022 streaming TV series ''[[Sprung (TV series)|Sprung]]'' in all but the first episode. The entire song closed the final episode.

==Personal life and death==
Reed married country singer [[Priscilla Mitchell]] on July 9, 1959; they had two daughters (Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970) who also became country singers.<ref name="nytobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/arts/music/03reed.html |title=Jerry Reed, Country Singer and Actor, Dies at 71 |first=Bill |last=Friskics-Warren |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=A23 |date=September 2, 2008}}</ref><ref name="MusicRow">{{cite news|last1=Oermann|first1=Robert K.|title=LifeNotes: Singer Priscilla Mitchell Passes|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2014/09/singer-priscilla-mitchell-passes/|access-date=December 12, 2014|work=[[MusicRow]]|date=September 29, 2014}}</ref>

He was survived by Mitchell and their two daughters. Mitchell died following a short illness on September 24, 2014, at the age of 73.<ref name="MusicRow"/>

Reed was a heavy smoker for many years. [[Thom Bresh]], son of [[Merle Travis]] and a close friend of Reed's, produced a 1990s video with Reed acting out his desire to quit smoking the addictive cigarettes ("Jerry Reed - [[Another Puff]]", which was his first 1972 released single) that serves as a public service video from Reed on the dangers of smoking cigarettes.<ref>{{YouTube|id=IUzvI3B55GM&t=46s|title="Jerry Reed - Another Puff"}}</ref>

'''James Frederick Rodgers''' (September 18, 1933 – January 18, 2021) was an American pop singer. Rodgers had a run of hits and mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. His string of crossover singles ranked highly on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]], [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]], and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm and Blues Sides]] charts; in the 1960s, Rodgers had more modest successes with [[adult contemporary music]].

He was not related to country music pioneer [[Jimmie Rodgers|Jimmie C. Rodgers]] (1897–1933), who died the same year the younger Rodgers was born. Among country audiences, and in his official songwriting credits, the younger Rodgers, Jimmie Frederick, was often credited as '''Jimmie F. Rodgers''' to differentiate the two.

==Career==
===Early years===
Rodgers was born in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref name="auto4">Wayne Harada. "Spotlighted Singer." ''Honolulu Advertiser'', September 15, 1957, p. 36.</ref>  He was the second son of Archie and Mary Rodgers.<ref name="auto2">John Vergara, "Oh, Oh, He's Done It Again." ''New York Daily News'', April 27, 1958, p. M4.</ref>  Rodgers was taught music by his mother, a piano teacher,<ref name="auto1">"Jimmie Rodgers Returns to the Stage." ''Reno (NV) Gazette'', February 24, 1983, p. 16.</ref> and began performing as a child, first entertaining at a Christmas show when he was only five.<ref name="auto4" /> He learned to play the piano and guitar, and performed locally.

After attending [[Camas High School]], he briefly took courses at Clark College in Vancouver, Washington.<ref name="auto2" /> He later went to work at the [[Crown Zellerbach]] paper mill in Camas.  Although he loved music, he was uncertain whether he could turn it into a career. He was subsequently drafted and served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.<ref name="auto">Dick Kleiner. "Honeycomb Started Here." ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 3, 1957, p. 7C.</ref>

=== 1950s ===
While in the Air Force, Rodgers joined a band named The Melodies started by violinist Phil Clark. During his service, he was transferred to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was stationed at Sewart Air Force Base from 1954 to 1956.<ref name="auto3">Robert K. Oermann. "Jimmie Rodgers: There's No Stopping Him Now." ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 27, 1985, p. D1.</ref> It was during this time that he began expanding his musical repertoire. While he was in Nashville, he first heard "[[Honeycomb (song)|Honeycomb]]", the song that became his first hit.<ref name="auto" />

Like a number of other entertainers of the era, he was one of the contestants on [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s talent show on CBS television, winning $700.<ref name="auto5">{{Cite web |title=Jimmie Rodgers on singing and surviving |url=https://www.thespectrum.com/story/entertainment/2016/05/26/jimmie-rodgers-singing-and-surviving/84813944/ |website=The Spectrum & Daily News}}</ref>  When [[Hugo Peretti]] and [[Luigi Creatore]] left [[RCA Records#Beginnings and history|RCA Victor]] for [[Morris Levy]]'s company, [[Roulette Records]], they became aware of Rodgers' talent and signed him to a recording contract.

In the summer of 1957, he recorded his version of "[[Honeycomb (song)|Honeycomb]]", written by [[Bob Merrill]] and recorded by [[Georgie Shaw]] three years earlier.<ref>Rod Ellis. "WDXN's Disc Digest." ''(Clarksville TN) Leaf-Chronicle'', September 6, 1957, p. 3.</ref>  The tune was Rodgers' biggest [[Hit song|hit]], staying on the top of the charts for four weeks. It sold over 1 million copies,<ref>"Honeycomb Passes Million." ''Cashbox'', October 5, 1957, p. 32.</ref> and was awarded a [[Music recording certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{Cite book |last=Murrells |first=Joseph |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |year=1978 |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |edition=2nd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 95] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Over the following year, he had a number of other hits that reached the top 10 on the charts: "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]"; "[[Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again]]"; "[[Secretly]]"; and "[[Are You Really Mine?]]". Other hits include "[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]]", "Bimbombey", "Ring-a-ling-a-lario", "Tucumcari", "Tender Love and Care (T.L.C)", and a version of ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' as a film [[tie-in]] with the apocalyptic movie ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' in 1959.

In the United Kingdom, "Honeycomb" reached number 30 pn the UK Singles Chart in November 1957, and "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]" climbed to number 7 the following month.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{Cite book |last=Roberts |first=David |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |year=2006 |isbn=1-904994-10-5 |edition=19th |location=London |page=467}}</ref> Both "Kisses Sweeter than Wine" and "Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again" were million sellers.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" />

The success of "Honeycomb" earned Rodgers guest appearances on numerous variety programs during 1957, including the "Shower of Stars" program, hosted by [[Jack Benny]], on October 31, 1957,<ref>Barbara Sammons. "Your TV Favorites on New Time Schedule Starting Today." ''Greenville (SC) News'', October 27, 1957, p. 28.</ref> and the Big Record with [[Patti Page]], on December 4, 1957.<ref>"Wednesday Television Programs." ''(New Brunswick NJ) Sunday Home News'', December 1, 1957, p. 13.</ref>  Rodgers also made several appearances on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'', including on September 8, 1957, when he was seen by 48,500,000, the largest television audience of his entire career,<ref>"TV News." ''(Salem OR) Capital Journal'', September 7, 1957, Section 2, p. 6.</ref> and November 3, 1957.<ref>"Famous Dancers From Bali Will Be on KOIN-TV." ''(Longview WA) Daily News'', November 2, 1957, p. 19.</ref>  In 1958, he appeared on NBC's ''[[The Gisele MacKenzie Show]]''. Also in 1958, he sang the opening theme song of the film ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]], [[Joanne Woodward]] and [[Orson Welles]].<ref>"Folk Song Rodgers to Do Title Number." ''Los Angeles Times'', December 27, 1957, part 3, p. 10.</ref> He then had his own short-lived televised variety show on NBC in 1959.<ref>William Ewald. "Television in Review." ''Naugatuck (CT) News'', May 27, 1959, p. 7.</ref>

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, Rodgers' [[Sloop John B|"Wreck of the John B"]] was a number 1 hit in Canada, and reached No. 64 on the U.S.charts. His biggest hit of the decade in the UK was "English Country Garden", a version of the folk song "[[Country Gardens]]", which reached number 5 in the chart in June 1962.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />  In 1962, he moved to the [[Dot Records|Dot]] label, and four years later to [[A&M Records]]. He also appeared in some films, including ''[[The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1961 film)|The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[Back Door to Hell]]'', which he helped finance.

In 1966, a long dry spell ended for Rodgers when he re-entered the Top 40 with "[[It's Over (Jimmie Rodgers song)|It's Over]]" (later to be recorded by [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Mason Williams]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], and [[Sonny James]]). In 1967, he changed record labels, signing with [[A&M Records]].<ref>Bill Rumfelt. "Easy Listening." ''Rocky Mount (NC) Telegram'', September 17, 1967, p. 2A.</ref> It was with that label that Rodgers had his final charting Top 100 single, "Child of Clay", written by [[Ernie Maresca]] (of "[[Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)]]" fame).<ref>David F. Wagner. "Under the Album Covers." ''Appleton (WI) Post-Crescent'', September 24, 1967, p. S10.</ref> He performed the song on several television variety shows, including ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'',<ref>"Channel Choices," ''Allentown (PA) Morning Call'', November 11, 1967, p. 10</ref> but it never became a big hit; it reached number 31 on the ''Billboard'' charts.

===Later career===
Recovery from injuries sustained mysteriously on a highway in 1967 caused an approximately year-long period in which Rodgers ceased to perform. Meanwhile, his voice was still being heard: Several of his earlier hits were used in jingles in the 1970s, one for [[SpaghettiOs]] and another for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb]] breakfast cereal.<ref name="auto3" /> And Rodgers' songs continued to make the ''Billboard'' Country and Easy Listening charts until 1979. During the summer of 1969, he made a brief return to network television with a summer variety show <ref>Paul Henniger. "TV People." ''San Francisco Examiner'', December 2, 1970, p. TV 19</ref> on ABC (which later bought the rights to Rodgers' [[Dot Records]] releases, now owned by [[Universal Music Group]]). It was not until the early 1980s when he began doing some limited live appearances again. Among the earliest was a series of shows in late February 1983: he performed at [[Harrah's Reno]] Casino Cabaret.<ref name="auto1" /> He also performed a few shows in other cities, including at a nightclub named Mister Days in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in late 1983.<ref>Tim Smith. "Jimmie Rodgers Rides Sweet Nostalgia Wave." ''Fort Lauderdale News/Sun-Sentinel'', May 27, 1983, p. 22.</ref>

Rodgers appeared in the 1999 video ''Rock & Roll Graffiti'' by American Public Television, along with about 20 other performers.<ref name="auto6">{{Cite news |title=Street signs point to Jimmie Rodgers Avenue |work=The Columbian |url=https://www.columbian.com/news/2013/sep/13/street-signs-point-to-jimmie-rodgers-avenue/}}</ref> Nevertheless, he gave "Honeycomb" a try, and he mentioned that he had a show in Branson, Missouri.

Rodgers returned to his hometown of Camas, Washington in 2011 and 2012, performing to sell-out crowds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 2013, his neighbors successfully got a street named after him, in the neighborhood where he grew up.<ref name="auto6" />

==Head injuries==
On December 1, 1967, Rodgers suffered traumatic head injuries after the car he was driving was stopped by an off-duty police officer near the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles. He had a fractured skull and required several surgeries.<ref name="sreimp">{{Cite news |date=December 11, 1967 |title=Singer reported improved after two brain operations |page=3A |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=Associated Press |location=(Oregon) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8OVVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4741%2C2607319}}</ref> Initial reports in the newspapers attributed his injuries to a severe beating with a blunt instrument by unknown assailants.<ref name="sgrhosp">{{Cite news |date=December 4, 1967 |title=Singer hospitalized |page=8 |work=Spartanburg Herald |agency=Associated Press |location=(South Carolina) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aX0sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vMwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6810%2C713954}}</ref><!--<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bWIwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3886,1691466&hl=en] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> --> Rodgers had no specific memory of how he had been injured, remembering only that he had seen blindingly bright lights from a car pulling up behind him.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BAAqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7361,530374&dq=jimmie+rodgers+bright+lights&hl=en |website=News.google.com |access-date=2016-09-20 |archive-date=2020-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309185307/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BAAqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7361,530374&dq=jimmie+rodgers+bright+lights&hl=en |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A few days later, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) stated that off-duty LAPD officer Michael Duffy (at times identified in the press as Richard Duffy) had stopped him for erratic driving, and that Rodgers had stumbled, fallen and hit his head. According to the police version, Duffy then called for assistance from two other officers, and the three of them put the unconscious Rodgers into his car and left the scene.<ref name="ppapltf">{{Cite news |date=December 20, 1967 |title=Jimmie Rodgers' injury linked to fall |page=11 |work=Pittsburgh Press |agency=UPI |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CsQbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pU8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7177%2C1546271}}</ref> That account was supported by the treating physicians, who had first blamed the skull fracture on a beating but, by the latter part of December, they concluded that Rodgers had in fact fallen and that had caused his injuries.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dmIwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=918,4276394&hl=en "New Disclosure Hints Rodgers Hurt By Fall," ''The Modesto Bee'', December 20, 1967, p.

Neither suit came to trial; the police slander suit was dropped, and in 1973 Rodgers elected to accept a $200,000 settlement from the Los Angeles City Council, which voted to give him the money rather than to incur the costs and risks of further court action.<ref name="fssetsu">{{Cite news |date=August 23, 1973 |title=Folk singer settles suit for $200,000 |page=15-A |work=St. Petersburg Times |agency=UPI |location=(Florida) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gepRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-HIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7055%2C1376958}}</ref> Rodgers and his supporters still believe that one or more of the police officers beat him, although other observers find the evidence inconclusive.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nashville Sound: Jimmie Rodgers |url=https://apnews.com/4c81ad015fac57cb988e8525ce047ad7 |website=Apnews.com}}</ref> In his 2010 biography ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', singer [[Tommy James]] wrote that [[Morris Levy]], the Mafia-connected head of Roulette Records, had arranged the attack in response to Rodgers' repeated demands for unpaid royalties he was due by the label. All of Rodgers' most successful singles had been released by Roulette, who were notorious for not paying their artists for their record sales.<ref>James, Tommy, ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', Scribner Publishing, 2010, p. 205</ref>

In 1993, Raymond Virgil Whisman, one of the three officers who were alleged to have assaulted Rodgers, was arrested for assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her.  The arrest occurred after sheriff's deputies stormed his house after being informed that he was holding his wife at gunpoint. Deputies found 11 rifles, four shotguns, and two handguns in the home.  Whisman was charged with two counts of assault and two counts of making terroristic threats.<ref>The Signal,Santa Clarita, California

== Publication ==
In 2010, Rodgers wrote and published his autobiography, ''Dancing on the Moon: The Jimmie Rodgers Story.''<ref name="auto5" /> 

== Personal life ==
Rodgers and his first wife Colleen (''née'' McClatchey) divorced in 1970, and she died May 20, 1977.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lodi News-Sentinel - Google News Archive Search |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19770520&id=QMMzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wjIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=4723,2163053 |website=News.google.com}}</ref>  They had two children, Michael and Michele. He had remarried in 1970, and Jimmie and Trudy Rodgers had two sons, Casey and Logan. He and Trudy divorced in the late 1970s, and he remarried again. Jimmie and Mary Rodgers were still married when he died, and they have a daughter, Katrine, who was born in 1989.

Rodgers suffered from [[spasmodic dysphonia]] for a number of years and could hardly sing. After a 2012 concert, he returned home for open heart surgery, following a heart attack he had suffered three weeks earlier. 

Rodgers died from kidney disease on January 18, 2021 at the age of 87.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Best Classic Bands Staff |date=19 January 2021 |title=Jimmie Rodgers, Early Rock 'n' Roll Star, Dies at 87 |work=Best Classic Bands |url=https://bestclassicbands.com/jimmie-rodgers-obituary-pop-singer-honeycomb-1-19-21 |access-date=2021-01-20}}</ref>

He was the creator of the [[Jimmy Dean (brand)|Jimmy Dean sausage brand]] as well as the spokesman for its TV commercials, and his likeness and voice continue to be used in advertisements after his death.<ref name="Dead Jimmy" />

He became a national television personality starting on CBS in 1957. He rose to fame for his 1961 country music crossover hit into rock and roll with "[[Big Bad John]]" and his 1963 television series ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]'' gave [[puppeteer]] [[Jim Henson]] his first national exposure with his character, [[Rowlf the Dog|Rowlf]].

His acting career included appearing in the early seasons in the ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' TV series as the sidekick of the famous frontiersman played by star [[Fess Parker]]. Later, he was on the big screen in a supporting role as billionaire Willard Whyte in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971), starring [[Sean Connery]].

He lived near [[Richmond, Virginia]], and was nominated for the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2010, but died before his induction that year at the age of 81.

==Biography==
[[File:NinePoundHammer(Live).ogg|thumb|240px|Jimmy Dean: "Nine Pound Hammer"]]

===Early life===
Dean was born on August 10, 1928, in [[Seth Ward, Texas]]<ref name="NYTobit" /> and raised in nearby [[Plainview, Texas|Plainview]], the son of George Otto Dean and his second wife, the former Ruth Taylor. Ruth taught Jimmy how to play piano at the age of 10.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=659/660}}</ref> He attributed his interest in music to the Seth Ward Baptist Church.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/elvis_jimmy_dean.shtml| title=Jimmy Dean Remembers Elvis Presley| last=Adams| first=David| website=Elvis Australia| date=January 1, 2015| access-date=May 2, 2019}}</ref> He dropped out of high school and became a professional entertainer after serving in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] in the late 1940s.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Dean was 22 and just starting in show business when he married his first wife, Mary Sue, in 1950.

===Entertainment career===
Dean had his first hit, "[[Just Bummin' Around|Bumming Around]]", in 1953<ref name="LarkinGE"/> on the [[Four Star Records|4 Star]] label (written by Pete Graves, credited to "C. Graves" on the Quality label). Dean signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1957.

He had minor pop hits, such as "Little Sandy Sleighfoot" (a Christmas novelty song) and "Sing Along", later used as the theme for TV's ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'', hosted by chorus leader [[Mitch Miller]].

In 1954, Dean hosted the popular Washington, D.C., radio program ''Town and Country Time'' on [[WAVA (AM)|WARL-AM]], and with his Texas Wildcats became popular in the Mid-Atlantic region.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Roy Clark]] got their starts on the show. Although Cline and Dean became good friends, Clark (Dean's lead guitarist) was fired by the singer for what was explained as his chronic tardiness. Dean replaced Clark with [[Billy Grammer]]. In 1955, ''Town and Country Time'' moved to [[WJLA-TV|WMAL-TV]] (now [[WJLA-TV]]) on weekday afternoons.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Dean and the Texas Wildcats also appeared during 1957 on ''Town and Country Jamboree'' on WMAL-TV on Saturdays, which was also carried by TV stations in neighboring Maryland and Virginia on a regional network.

Also during 1957, while he lived in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], Dean hosted ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show#Daytime|Country Style]]'' on [[WUSA (TV)|WTOP-TV]] (now [[WUSA-TV]]). CBS picked up the show nationally from Washington for eight months in 1957 under the name ''[[CBS Morning Show#The 1950s|The Morning Show]]''.<ref name="Billboard May 1957">{{cite magazine |title=CBS Sets Night Slot for Dean |magazine=Billboard |volume=69 |issue=21 |page=8 |date=May 27, 1957 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref name="Life Oct 1957">{{cite magazine| title=The Quick Rise of an Early Riser| magazine=Life| volume=43| issue=15| page=78| date=October 7, 1957| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA78| issn=0024-3019}}</ref> Then from September 14, 1958, to June 1959, CBS carried ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]'' on weekday and Saturday afternoons.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Dean became best known for "[[Big Bad John]]", his 1961 [[recitation song]] about a heroic miner.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Recorded in Nashville, the record went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1961 (USA)|number one]] on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' pop chart and inspired many imitations and parodies.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year=1978| title=The Book of Golden Discs| edition=2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UxRAAAAAMAAJ&q=jimmy+dean| location=London| pages=133–134| isbn=978-0214204807}}</ref> The track peaked at number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first=David| last=Roberts| year=2006| title=British Hit Singles & Albums| edition=19th

Kennedy]]'s bravery in [[World War II]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> with the sinking of his [[PT-boat]] in the South Pacific Ocean by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]].

In the early 1960s, he hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' on occasion (he was the first guest host during [[Johnny Carson]]'s tenure, hosting for the first time on January 14, 1963) and one night introduced country singer [[Roy Clark]], with whom he had remained friendly. In the mid-1960s, Dean helped bring country music into the mainstream<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-jimmy-dean-20100615-story.html| title=Jimmy Dean dies at 81; country music star and sausage king| last=McLellan| first=Dennis| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=June 15, 2010| access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref> with his 1963–66 variety series ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]''. It presented country music entertainers including [[Roger Miller]], [[George Jones]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[Buck Owens]], and some (such as [[Joe Maphis]]) who seldom received network exposure. In 1964, he hosted [[Hank Williams Jr.]] in Williams' first television appearance at the age of 14. He sang several songs associated with his father, [[Hank Williams]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929947/| title=Hank Williams, Jr.| website=[[IMDb]]| access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref> The program also featured comedy and a variety of popular music artists, and Dean's sketches with [[Rowlf the Dog]], one of Jim Henson's Muppets. Henson was so grateful for this break that he offered Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined on the basis that he had done nothing to truly earn it and Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work. For the rest of his life, Dean made it clear that he never regretted this decision.<ref>{{cite web| title=A Hell Of A Man Himself| url=http://thebluegrassspecial.com/archive/2010/july10/jimmy-dean-news-notes.php| publisher=The Bluegrass Special.com| access-date=October 18, 2011| archive-date=October 20, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020154333/http://thebluegrassspecial.com/archive/2010/july10/jimmy-dean-news-notes.php| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Dean appeared on several TV talk shows and game shows in the 1960s and performed on variety programs, including ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{IMDb name|id=0212818|name=Jimmy Dean}}</ref> Dean turned to acting after his television series ended in 1966. His best-known role was as a reclusive Las Vegas billionaire [[Willard Whyte]], inspired by [[Howard Hughes]], in the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) with [[Sean Connery]] as Bond. He also appeared in 14 episodes of ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' (1967–70) in three different roles (one episode as "Delo Jones," two as "Jeremiah," and 11 as "Josh Clements"); as Charlie Rowlands in two ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' episodes (1981–82); and on other television shows including a semi-regular role as Charlie Bullets on ''[[J.J. Starbuck]]'' starring [[Dale Robertson]] (1987–1988).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Dean's singing career remained strong into the mid-1960s; in 1965, he achieved a second number one country hit with the ballad "[[The First Thing Ev'ry Morning (And the Last Thing Ev'ry Night)]]",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and he had a top 40 hit that year with "Harvest of Sunshine". In 1966, Dean signed with [[RCA Victor]] and immediately had a top 10 hit with "Stand Beside Me".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> His other major hits during this time included "Sweet Misery" (1967) and "[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]" (1968).<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He continued charting into the early 1970s with his major hits, including "Slowly" (1971), a duet with [[Dottie West]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and a solo hit with "The One You Say Good Morning To" (1972).<ref name="Billboard Feb 5, 1972">{{cite magazine| title=Hot Country Singles| magazine=Billboard|volume=84| number=6| page=38| date=February 5, 1972| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ycEAAAAMBAJ| issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

In 1976, Dean achieved a million-seller with another recitation song called "[[I.O.U. (Jimmy Dean song)|I.O.U.]]", a tribute to his mother and mothers everywhere.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The song was released a few weeks before [[Mother's Day]] and quickly became a top 10 country hit, his first in 10 years, and a top 40 pop hit, his first in 14 years. The song was re-released in 1977, 1983, and 1984, but with minor success each time.

In January 1978, Dean hosted an all-star tribute to [[Elvis Presley]] titled ''Nashville Remembers Elvis on His Birthday'', during which he reminisced about his friendship with the recently deceased singer and performed his own hit "Big Bad John" and "[[Peace in the Valley]]".

===Business career===
In 1969, he founded the [[Jimmy Dean (brand)|Jimmy Dean Sausage Company]]<ref name="NYTobit"/> with his brother Don. The company did well in part because of Dean's own extemporized, humorous commercials.<ref name = " Texas Monthly 1983">{{cite magazine| last=Calhoun| first=Fryar| title=Hi!

The success of the company led to its acquisition in 1984 by Consolidated Foods, later renamed the [[Sara Lee Corporation]]. Dean remained involved as spokesman for the company, but the new corporate parent immediately began phasing him out of any management duties. In January 2004, Dean said that Sara Lee had dropped him as the spokesman for the sausage brand because he was too old.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/13/jimmy-dean-dead-singer-sa_n_610708.html| title=Jimmy Dean DEAD: Singer, Sausage Businessman Dies At 81| first=Dena| last=Potter| newspaper=The Huffington Post| date=June 13, 2010}}</ref> In March 2004, Dean revealed that he had sold all but one of his shares in Sara Lee stock.<ref name="SLC ditch">{{cite news |last1=Vries |first1=Lloyd |title=Dean One Spicy Sausage King |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dean-one-spicy-sausage-king/ |work=CBS News |access-date=November 6, 2018 |date=March 29, 2004}}</ref> In 2018, several years after his death, the sausage company began re-airing some classic commercials featuring the voice of Dean introducing himself and praising the product.<ref name="Dead Jimmy">{{cite news |title=Is Jimmy Dean's real voice used in new commercials?|url=https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/verify-is-jimmy-deans-real-voice-used-in-new-commercials/507-619038867 |date=November 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230118232804/https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/verify-is-jimmy-deans-real-voice-used-in-new-commercials/507-619038867 |archive-date=January 18, 2023}}</ref>

===Later years and death===
In the 1980s, he and his wife and family were residents of [[Tenafly, New Jersey]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/style/walter-jones-taylor-wed-to-connie-elizabeth-dean.html "Walter Jones Taylor Wed To Connie Elizabeth Dean"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 8, 1987. Accessed October 11, 2015.

A Virginia resident from 1990, Dean was inducted into the Virginia Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997. Former Virginia governor [[Jim Gilmore]] appointed Dean to the [[Virginia Board of Game and Inland Fisheries]], which oversees the state's wildlife efforts and boating laws. Dean owned a 110-foot yacht, ''Big Bad John'', on which he hosted President [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George Bush]] on numerous occasions.<ref name="Hosler">{{cite news |last1=Hosler |first1=Karen |title=Lifestyle of the rich and famous: At White House, Bush lives it up |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-03/news/1991246017_1_kevin-costner-joe-dimaggio-george-bush |access-date=November 6, 2018 |date=September 3, 1991 |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref> The two had originally met on Dean's cable show in Nashville, where Bush did an impression of Dean selling sausage.<ref name="Bush Memories">{{cite news |last1=Warren |first1=Ellen |title=THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES, MR.

In the fall of 2004, he released his blunt, straight-talking autobiography ''30 Years of Sausage, 50 Years of Ham''. Dean lived in semi-retirement with his second wife, Donna Meade Dean, a singer, songwriter, and recording artist he married in 1991, who helped him write his book. The couple lived on their property at [[Chaffin's Bluff]] overlooking the James River in Henrico County, on the outskirts of Richmond, Virginia. On April 20, 2009, the main house was largely gutted by a fire, although the Deans escaped injury. The Deans rebuilt their home on the same foundation and returned early in 2010.

Dean announced on May 20, 2008, a donation of $1 million to [[Wayland Baptist University]] in Plainview, the largest gift ever from one individual to the institution. Dean said: "I've been so blessed, and it makes me proud to give back, especially to my hometown."<ref>{{cite press release| title=Singer Jimmy Dean and wife donate $1 million to Wayland| url=https://www.wbu.edu/news-and-events/archives/2008/may/deanstory.htm| publisher=Wayland Baptist University| date=May 16, 2008| access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>
Dean and his wife also donated generously to Varina High School to reward academic scholars.

On February 23, 2010, Dean was nominated for the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]; he was scheduled to be inducted in October 2010, but this occurred after his death.

Dean had three children, Garry, Connie and Robert, with his first wife Mary Sue (Sue) (née Wittauer) Dean, and two granddaughters, Caroline Taylor (Connie's daughter) and Brianna Dean (Robert's daughter). He married his first wife in 1950; she divorced him in 1990 because of his affair with country-singer Donna Meade who became his second wife.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-10-31-mn-3436-story.html| title=NATION: Jimmy Dean Sued for Divorce| date=October 31, 1991| newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Donna Dean married her childhood sweetheart Jason Stevens two years after Dean's death.<ref>{{cite news| title=Donna Meade Dean to remarry| url=https://www.richmond.com/news/donna-meade-dean-to-remarry/article_58fe488d-c460-54bd-a8c5-b50efdad7d50.html| newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]| date=August 5, 2015}}</ref>

He was entombed in a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} piano-shaped mausoleum overlooking the James River on the grounds of his estate.

'''Jimmy Lee Fautheree''' (April 11, 1934 - June 29, 2004) was an American [[rockabilly]] and country singer.

Born in [[Smackover, Arkansas]], he began playing guitar at age 12, and was heavily influenced by [[Merle Travis]]. In 1946 his family moved to [[Dallas]], where he played on [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]]'s ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. By 1951 he was playing on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''; that year he signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released his first single, "I Keep the Blues All the Time", as Jimmy Lee. Capitol released seven further singles from Fautheree before dropping him in 1952. Despite never charting, the recordings have been cited as influential on later rockabilly artists, including [[James Burton]].

Fautheree subsequently found work as a [[session musician]] for musicians such as [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Along with [["Country" Johnny Mathis]], he performed on ''Louisiana Hayride'' as [[Jimmy & Johnny]], and released a charting single under the "Jimmy Lee & Johnny Mathis" moniker on [[Chess Records]], 1954's "If You Don't, Somebody Else Will". Fautheree left Mathis to work with Wayne Walker, a partnership that lasted only four months but yielded a few recordings. Following this he began recording with his brother Lynn, again under the name Jimmy & Johnny; they signed to [[Decca Records]], but by 1957 the pair had moved back to Dallas.

Fautheree went back to solo recording, recording in [[New Orleans]] in 1958 at J&M Studio. He recorded briefly with Mathis again between 1958 and 1959. Some self-released material and a single on [[Paula Records]] brought him into 1960, and throughout the next decade Fautheree worked increasingly in the genre of [[gospel music]].

By the 1970s Fautheree had left the business, working in [[asbestos]] removal. In 1995, he returned to music with Mathis, recording a new single, "It Won't Be Much Longer", together. He played both in the U.S. and abroad in the 2000s, and released a full-length album with [[Deke Dickerson]] entitled ''I Found the Doorknob''. Shortly after the album was complete he died of [[cancer]] in Dallas on June 29, 2004.

His mother's name was Lodema Hammonds, the daughter of Mack Hammonds of Maud, Texas, who was a descendant of [[Phillip Hamman]], the Savior of the Greenbrier.

'''Arnold Joseph Poovey''' (May 10, 1941 – October 6, 1998), often credited on record and stage as '''"Groovey" Joe Poovey''' (in various alternate spellings), was an American [[rockabilly]] and [[country music|country]] singer, songwriter, guitarist and radio disc jockey.  His best known record was "Ten Long Fingers", recorded in 1958.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Dallas, Texas]], he was encouraged to be an entertainer as a child.  He initially learned the [[steel guitar]],<ref name=Morrison>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qAHvUO5GknMC&dq=%22joe+poovey%22&pg=PA158  Craig Morrison, ''Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly music and its makers'', University of Illinois Press, 1996, p.158]</ref> and made his first recordings at the age of 10.  Two years later, in 1953, he formed a group, the Hillbilly Boys, and started weekly broadcasts on radio station [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], soon followed by work as a disc jockey on the "[[Big D Jamboree]]" radio show. He also recorded several Christmas-themed songs, including "Santa's Helper", written by his father Bernice Poovey.  After opening a show for [[Elvis Presley]] in 1955, he instantly changed his musical style from traditional country music to rockabilly.  In 1957, as '''Jumping Joe Poovey''', he recorded "Move Around" on the [[Dixie Records|Dixie]] label, produced by Jim Shell in Dallas.  It was followed the next year by "Ten Long Fingers", a tribute to [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], on which he was credited as "Groove Joe Poovey" {{sic}}.   Although the record was later acclaimed as a classic rockabilly number, featuring piano by local prodigy C.B. Oliver, it was only locally successful, and Poovey remained working in the Dallas and [[Fort Worth]] area, recording occasionally for small local labels.<ref name=hall>[http://rockabillyhall.com/JoePoovey1.html  Groovey Joe Poovey at the Rockabilly Hall of Fame]</ref><ref name=tsha>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo69  The Handbook of Texas Online: Groovey Joe Poovey]</ref><ref name=blackcat>[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/groovey_joe_poovey.htm  Groovey Joe Poovey at Black Cat Rockabilly]</ref><ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-poovey-p366176/biography  Biography by Jason Ankeny at Allmusic.com]</ref>

In the 1960s he returned to playing country music and worked as a songwriter, his songs being recorded by such musicians as [[George Jones]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]].  In 1966, using the pseudonym '''Johnny Dallas''', he recorded "Heart Full of Love", which reached no. 62 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]].  However, follow-ups failed to match its success, and he retired from performing to concentrate on his work as a disc jockey, working on various radio stations in the Dallas – Fort Worth area.  In the 1970s, his earlier records began to be recognised by rockabilly fans in Europe, where he first performed in 1980, and unreleased recordings from the 1950s were made available.  He also began recording again, releasing several new singles under the name '''Texas Joe Poovey'''.  At the same time, he worked as a chauffeur on the film set of the ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' TV series.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/><ref name=allmusic/>

He continued to make regular visits to Britain and Europe, performing both country and rockabilly music, into the 1990s.  Shortly before the release of a retrospective album, ''Golden Grooves'', he died at the age of 57 from a heart condition.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/>

'''John R. Cash''' (born '''J. R. Cash'''; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter.

Her paternal DNA suggested African ancestry in a similar time frame among Johnny Cash's family.<ref name=gates/>  

After meeting with the then-[[laird]] of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] in [[Fife]], Major Michael Crichton-Stuart, Cash became interested in his Scots ancestry. He traced his Scottish surname to 11th-century Fife. {{Sfn|Miller|2003|p=11}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dalton |first=Stephanie |date=January 15, 2006 |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/people.cfm?id=66542006 |title=Walking the line back in time |newspaper=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |access-date=June 28, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021235805/http://heritage.scotsman.com/people.cfm?id=66542006 |archive-date=October 21, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page= 3 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0-06-072753-5 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the surname of his father.{{Sfn|Miller|2003|p=11}} He is a distant cousin of British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Bill Cash|Sir William Cash]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/me-and-my-cousin-johnny-by-william-cash-q8gvzxml5|title=Me and my cousin Johnny, by William Cash|first=William|last=Cash|date=October 24, 2019|website=Thetimes.co.uk}}</ref> He also had English ancestry.

In March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in [[Dyess, Arkansas]], a [[New Deal]] colony established during the [[Great Depression]] under the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. It was intended to give poor families the opportunity to work land that they might later own.<ref name=Bowden>{{cite news|last1=Bowden|first1=Bill|title=National Register accepts Johnny Cash boyhood home in Arkansas|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|access-date=May 7, 2018|work=ArkansasOnline|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505231153/http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|archive-date=May 5, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> 

From the age of five, Cash worked in cotton fields with his family, singing with them as they worked. Dyess and the Cash farm suffered a flood during his childhood. Later he wrote the song "[[Five Feet High and Rising (song)|Five Feet High and Rising]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=20  |url=https://books.google.com/books |isbn=0-06-072753-5 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression gave him a lifelong sympathy for the poor and working class, and inspired many of his songs.

Cash often spoke of the guilt he felt over the incident. He would say that he looked forward to "meeting [his] brother in Heaven".<ref name="Streissguth_profile" />

Cash's early memories were dominated by [[gospel music]] and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a [[tenor|high-tenor]] voice, before becoming a [[baritone|bass-baritone]] after his [[voice change]]d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gross |first1=Terry |title=All I Did Was Ask: Conversations with Writers, Actors Musicians, and Artists |date=2004 |publisher=[[Hachette Books]] |page=31 |edition=Hardcover}}</ref> 

In high school, he sang on a local Arkansas radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs called ''[[My Mother's Hymn Book]]''. He was also strongly influenced by traditional [[Music of Ireland|Irish music]], which he heard performed weekly by [[Dennis Day]] on the [[Jack Benny]] radio program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Johnny Cash: The 'Fresh Air' Interview |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=503138966 |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=February 27, 2019 |date=November 24, 2016 |quote=And I'd sing Dennis Day songs like. ...Yeah, songs that he sang on the Jack Benny show.

Cash enlisted in the Air Force on July 7, 1950, shortly after the start of the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|first=William|last=Abbott|url=http://www.southernmusic.net/johnnycash.html|title=Johnny Cash&nbsp;– February 26, 1932&nbsp;– September 12, 2003|website=Southernmusic.net|access-date=December 31, 2011}}</ref> After [[basic training]] at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] and technical training at [[Brooks Air Force Base]], both in [[San Antonio, Texas]], Cash was assigned to the 12th Radio Squadron Mobile of the [[U.S. Air Force Security Service]] at [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]], [[West Germany]]. While in San Antonio, he met [[Vivian Cash|Vivian Liberto]], an attractive girl of Sicilian, Irish and German ancestry. They dated briefly before his departure. During the years he served overseas, they exchanged thousands of letters.

He worked in West Germany as a [[Morse code]] operator, intercepting [[Soviet Army]] transmissions. While working this job, Cash was said to be the first American to be given the news of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death (supplied via Morse code).

=== Early career ===
[[File:Johnny Cash Promotional Photo 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Publicity photo for Sun Records, 1955]]
In 1954, Cash and his first wife Vivian moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to "go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell". In a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|newspaper=NPR|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, "[[Hey Porter]]" and "[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.

Cash's next record, "Folsom Prison Blues", made the country top five. His "[[I Walk the Line]]" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. "[[Home of the Blues]]" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Cash felt that Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.

In 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single "[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]" became one of his biggest hits. He recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind such a backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.{{Efn|When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it had also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.}}

Early in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname "the Undertaker" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|title=10 Things you didn't know about Johnny Cash|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=October 31, 2013|archive-date=October 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016134501/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], June, and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]''. It was later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.

Cash's career was handled by [[Saul Holiff]], a [[London, Ontario]], promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com|title=My Father and The Man in Black|website=Johnny-and-saul.com|access-date=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517093414/http://johnny-and-saul.com/|archive-date=May 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his "nervousness" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].

Although he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by [[June Carter]]'s sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash.<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles|10|3}}</ref> He said that it had come to him in a dream. 

His first wife Vivian (Liberto) Cash claimed a different version of the origins of "Ring of Fire". In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'' (2007), Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Vivian |last2=Sharpsteen |first2=Ann |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1416532927 |page=294 |edition=Hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmkBUE0f3HAC&pg=PA294 |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>

In June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California. It set off a forest fire that burned several hundred acres and nearly caused his death.<ref>"Major brush fire." ''Los Angeles Times'', June 28, 1965, p. 1.</ref><ref>"Control of Brush Fire Near; 700 Acres Burned." ''Los Angeles Times'', June 29, 1965, p. 27.</ref> Cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper, but Fielder thought that Cash started a fire to stay warm and, under the influence of drugs, failed to notice the fire getting out of control.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hilburn|first1=Robert|title=Johnny Cash: The Life|year=2013|publisher=Little, Brown and Company| edition=ebook|isbn=978-0-316-19475-4}}</ref> When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, "I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it."<ref>Hilburn, 2013 (ebook)</ref>

Although Cash cultivated a romantic [[outlaw]] image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he was held only one night each time. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this incident as the basis for the song "Starkville City Jail". He discussed this on his live ''At San Quentin'' album.)<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[At San Quentin]]'', [[Columbia Records]] CS 9827, 1969</ref> 

While on tour later that year, he was arrested October 4 in [[El Paso, Texas]], by a [[narcotic]]s squad. The officers suspected he was [[smuggling]] [[heroin]] from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules (amphetamines) and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, Cash received a [[suspended sentence]]. He posted a $1,500 bond and was released until his arraignment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219065356/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 19, 2013|title=Johnny Cash's dark California days|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=October 12, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

In this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s. His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. 

In 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.

Reaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash and his first wife divorced after having separated in 1962. Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]", won a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22johnny+cash%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All/|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

Cash was last arrested in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills when in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> 

Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: "I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me."<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref> June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in [[Franklin, Kentucky]]. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had "cleaned up."<ref>{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone: The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music|url=https://archive.org/details/willyoumissmewhe0000zwon|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-85763-3}}</ref>

Cash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an "[[altar call]]" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend [[Hank Snow]]. According to [[Marshall Grant]], though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968; and did not fully end drug use for another two years. He was drug-free for a period of seven years. In his memoir about time with Cash, Grant said that the birth of Cash's son, [[John Carter Cash]], inspired the singer to end his dependence.<ref name="Grant page 92">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92 92, 177]|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92}}</ref>

Cash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was deeply addicted again. He entered rehab at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]] for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. 

In 1989, he entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he started care at the Loma Linda Behavioral Medicine Center in [[Loma Linda, California]], for his final rehabilitation treatment. (Several months later, his son followed him into this facility for treatment.)<ref name=Grant>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars}}</ref><ref name="John Carter Cash">{{cite book|last=Cash|first=John Carter|title=Anchored in Love|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8499-0187-4}}</ref>

=== Folsom and other prison concerts ===
In the late 1950s Cash began performing concerts at prisons. He played his first notable prison concert on January 1, 1958, at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in California.<ref name="cash1958">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/inmate-merle-haggard-hears-johnny-cash-play-san-quentin-state-prison "Inmate Merle Haggard hears Johnny Cash play San Quentin State Prison"], history.com; accessed June 24, 2014.</ref> These performances were recorded live, and released on highly successful albums: ''[[At Folsom Prison|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison]]'' (1968) and ''[[At San Quentin|Johnny Cash at San Quentin]]'' (1969). Both live albums reached number one on ''Billboard'' country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the ''Billboard'' pop album chart. In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even [[The Beatles]] by selling 6.5&nbsp;million albums.<ref>Edwards, Leigh H. "Cash, Johnny." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as ''Strawberry Cake'' recorded in London and ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.

The [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his "Folsom Prison Blues", while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single "[[A Boy Named Sue]]", a [[Shel Silverstein]] novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. [[Top 40|top-10]] pop charts.

In 1972 Cash performed at the [[Österåker Prison]] in Sweden. The live album ''[[På Österåker]]'' (''At Österåker'') was released in 1973. "San Quentin" was recorded with Cash replacing "San Quentin" with "Österåker". In 1976, a concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]] was videotaped for TV broadcast. It was posthumously released after Cash's death as a CD entitled ''[[A Concert Behind Prison Walls]]''.

=== Activism for Native Americans ===
Cash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Johnny Cash and the paradox of American Identity|last=Edwards|first=Leigh|publisher=Bloomington : Indiana University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-253-35292-7}}</ref> Cash sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S. government.

{{blockquote|In '57, I wrote a song called "Old Apache Squaw" and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.<ref>{{cite episode |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny| title=Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash |series=[[Rainbow Quest]] |season=1 |number=39 |year=1966}}</ref>}}

Columbia Music, the label for which Cash was recording then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it "too radical for the public".<ref>Cash, J., & Carr, P. (1997). ''Cash: The autobiography'' (p. 408). San Francisco, CA: HarperSanFrancisco.</ref> Cash singing songs of Indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country music in the 1950s, which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy who makes the native's soil his own.<ref>Tahmahkera, D. (2011). Volume 63. In ''American Quarterly'' (p. 597). Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

In 1964, coming off the chart success of his previous album ''[[I Walk the Line (1964 album)|I Walk the Line]]'', he recorded the aforementioned album ''[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian]]''.

The album featured stories of a multitude of Indigenous peoples, emphasizing their violent oppression by white settlers: the [[Pima people]] ("The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]"), [[Navajo]] ("Navajo"), [[Apache]] ("Apache Tears"), [[Lakota people|Lakota]] ("Big Foot"), [[Seneca people|Seneca]] ("As Long as the Grass Shall Grow"), and [[Cherokee]] ("The Talking Leaves"). Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one with the help of [[Johnny Horton]]. 

The majority of these protest songs were written by folk artist [[Peter La Farge]] (son of [[Oliver La Farge]], an activist and Pulitzer prizewinner.) Cash met the younger La Farge in New York in the 1960s and admired him for his activism.<ref>{{cite web|date=1965|title=Johnny Cash and June Carter (Television series episode). In Rainbow Quest. Pete Seeger|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQq0dw7rmtc|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead YouTube link|date=February 2022}}</ref> The album's single, "[[The Ballad of Ira Hayes]]" was generally not played by commercial radio. ([[Ira Hayes]] was a Native American who was one of the six soldiers featured in a photo raising the U.S. flag at [[Iwo Jima]] during World War II.)

The record label denied it promotion due to what it considered a provocative and "unappealing" nature. Cash faced resistance and was urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the [[Country Music Association]], who said: "You and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks, country artists, and country DJs."<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2009/11/09/johnny_cash_2/|title=The bitter tears of Johnny Cash|date=November 9, 2009|website=Salon.com|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>

In reaction, on August 22, 1964, Cash posted a letter as an advertisement in [[Billboard Magazine|''Billboard'']], calling the record industry cowardly: "D.J.s – station managers – owners{{nbsp}}[...] where are your guts? I had to fight back when I realized that so many stations are afraid of Ira Hayes. Just one question: WHY??? Ira Hayes is strong medicine{{nbsp}}[...] So is Rochester, Harlem, Birmingham and Vietnam."<ref>Tahmahkera, D. (2011). Volume 63. In ''American Quarterly'' (pp. 598–599).

The song eventually reached number three on the country charts, and the album rose to number two on the album charts.<ref name="auto" />

[[File:JohnnyCashHouse1969.jpg|thumb|right|Cash in 1969]]

Later, on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', he continued telling stories of Native-American plight, both in song and through short films, such as the history of the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1970|title=[Television series episode].

===''The Johnny Cash Show''===
From June 1969 to March 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/08/10/johnny-cashs-excellent-music-variety-tv-show-ran-58-episodes-but-was-canceled-in-a-rural-purge/|title=Johnny Cash's excellent music variety TV show ran 58 episodes but was canceled in a "rural purge"|date=August 10, 2017|work=The Vintage News|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Produced by [[Screen Gems]], the show was performed at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville. [[The Statler Brothers]] opened for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend Carl Perkins were also part of the regular show entourage. Cash also enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including [[Linda Ronstadt]] in her first TV appearance, [[Neil Young]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition]] (who appeared four times), [[James Taylor]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=":0" />

From September 15–18, 1969, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], he performed a series of four concerts at the [[New Mexico State Fair]] to promote the first season of ''The Johnny Cash Show''.<ref name="Johnny Cash Infocenter Albuquerque">{{cite web | title=Johnny Cash Live Performances | website=Johnny Cash Infocenter | date=September 11, 1956 | url=http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/concerts.php?search=Albuquerque&col=date&sort=ASC&filter1=&filter2=&submit=+Search+&x= | access-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-date=February 24, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224145334/http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/concerts.php?search=Albuquerque&col=date&sort=ASC&filter1=&filter2=&submit=+Search+&x= | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="JC Infocenter 1969">{{cite web | title=Details | website=Johnny Cash Infocenter | date=September 15, 1969 | url=http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/details.php?show=1969-09-15 | access-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-date=February 25, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225042925/http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/details.php?show=1969-09-15 | url-status=dead }}</ref> These live shows were produced with help from ABC and local concert producer Bennie Sanchez; during these sets, Johnny Cash and [[Al Hurricane]] performed together.<ref name="Jojola 2011">{{cite web | last=Jojola | first=Lloyd | title=ABQJOURNAL PROFILES: Sanchez: Matriarch to Musicians | website=Albuquerque Journal | date=January 31, 2011 | url=https://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/3192721214obitsprofiles01-31-11.htm | access-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-date=February 5, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205221219/https://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/3192721214obitsprofiles01-31-11.htm | url-status=dead }}</ref> Also during ''The Johnny Cash Show'' era, he contributed the title song and other songs to the film ''Little Fauss and Big Halsy'', which starred [[Robert Redford]], [[Michael J.

Cash had first met with Dylan in the mid-1960s and became neighbors in the late 1960s in [[Woodstock, New York]]. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan, "[[Girl from the North Country]]", on Dylan's country album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' and also wrote the album's [[Grammy]]-winning [[liner notes]].

Another artist who received a major career boost from ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was [[Kris Kristofferson]], who was beginning to make a name for himself as a singer-songwriter. During a live performance of Kristofferson's "[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]", Cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] intact:

The closing program of ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was a gospel music special. Guests included the [[The Blackwood Brothers|Blackwood Brothers]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Stuart Hamblen]], and [[Billy Graham]].<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash'', Relevant Books, 2003, p. 91.</ref>

=== The "Man in Black" ===
[[File:President Richard Nixon and Johnny Cash.jpg|thumb|Cash advocated [[prison reform]] at his July 1972 meeting with President [[Richard Nixon]]]]

By the early 1970s, Cash had established his public image as the "Man in Black". He regularly performed in entirely black suits with a long, black, knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the [[rhinestone]] suits and [[cowboy boots]] worn by most of the major country acts of his day.

[[File:Johnny-Cash 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Cash performing in [[Bremen]], West Germany, in September 1972]]
Cash said he wore all black on behalf of the poor and hungry, the "prisoner who has long paid for his crime", and those who have been betrayed by age or drugs.<ref name="85-86">{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |pages= 85–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> He added, "With the [[Vietnam War]] as painful in my mind as it was in most other Americans, I wore it 'in mourning' for the lives that could have been'&nbsp;... Apart from the Vietnam War being over, I don't see much reason to change my position&nbsp;... The old are still neglected, the poor are still poor, the young are still dying before their time, and we're not making many moves to make things right. There's still plenty of darkness to carry off."<ref name="85-86"/>

[[File:One piece at a time.jpg|thumb|right|Cash in the "one piece at a time" Cadillac]]
Initially, he and his band had worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color.<ref name="Page 64"/> The outdated [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|US Navy's winter blue uniform]] used to be referred to by sailors as "Johnny Cashes", as the uniform's shirt, tie, and trousers are solid black.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.navytimes.com/legacy/new/0-NAVYPAPER-356961.php|title=The good, bad and ugly of proposed uniforms|newspaper=[[Navy Times]]|date=October 4, 2004}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Cash's popularity and number of hit songs began to decline. He made commercials for [[Amoco]] and [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]], an unpopular enterprise at the time of the [[1970s energy crisis]]. In 1976, he made commercials for [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel Trains]], for which he also wrote the music.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lionel Trains: A Pictorial History of Trains and Their Collectors|page=19|author=Turner Publishing|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|year=2004|isbn=978-1-56311-958-3}}</ref> However, his first autobiography, ''Man in Black'', was published in 1975 and sold 1.3&nbsp;million copies. A second, ''Cash: The Autobiography'', appeared in 1997.

Cash's friendship with [[Billy Graham]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Allmond, Joy|date=September 13, 2015|title=Johnny Cash's Faith and Friendship with Billy Graham|publisher=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|url=https://billygraham.org/story/johnny-cashs-faith-and-friendship-with-billy-graham/}}</ref> led to his production of a film about the life of Jesus, ''[[Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus]]'', which Cash co-wrote and narrated. It was released in 1973. Cash viewed the film as a statement of his personal faith rather than a means of proselytizing.<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash.'' Relevant Books, 2003, p. 117.</ref>

Cash and June Carter Cash appeared several times on the ''Billy Graham Crusade'' TV specials, and Cash continued to include gospel and religious songs on many of his albums, though Columbia declined to release ''[[A Believer Sings the Truth]]'', a gospel double-LP Cash recorded in 1979 and which ended up being released on an independent label even with Cash still under contract to Columbia. On November 22, 1974, CBS ran his one-hour TV special entitled'' Riding The Rails'', a musical history of trains.

He continued to appear on television, hosting Christmas specials on [[CBS]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Later television appearances included a starring role in an episode of ''[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 3|Columbo]]'', entitled "Swan Song". June and he appeared in an episode of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', entitled "The Collection". He gave a performance as abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in the 1985 [[American Civil War]] television miniseries ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]''. In the 1990s, Johnny and June appeared in ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' in recurring roles.

He was friendly with every US president, starting with [[Richard Nixon]]. He was closest to [[Jimmy Carter]], with whom he became close friends and who was a distant cousin of his wife, June.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

Cash declined to play the first two and instead selected other songs, including "The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]" and his own compositions, "[[What Is Truth]]" and "Man in Black". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=304 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn= 9780062515001 |edition=hardcover| access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed "antihippie and antiblack" sentiments might have backfired.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page= 212 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> In his remarks when introducing Cash, Nixon joked that one thing he had learned about him was one did not tell him what to sing.<ref>[[Richard Nixon]], April 17, 1970, released on Johnny Cash, ''Bootleg Vol. III: Live Around the World'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]]/Legacy 88697 93033 2), released 2011</ref>

=== Highwaymen and departure from Columbia Records ===
[[File:Highwaymen.jpg|thumb|[[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] members [[Kris Kristofferson]], Johnny Cash, [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]]]]
In 1980, Cash became the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]'s youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s, his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;– The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.

During that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County (film)|Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life [[Murder in Coweta County|Georgia murder]] case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis.

Cash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an [[ostrich]] on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005}}</ref>

At a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a "[[near-death experience]]".

{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}
In 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled "[[The Chicken in Black]]" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash – who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as "A Boy Named Sue" and "One Piece at a Time" – accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked "like a buffoon" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores—interrupting its bona fide chart success—and termed the venture "a fiasco".<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 500–502</ref>

Between 1981 and 1984, he recorded several sessions with famed [[countrypolitan]] producer [[Billy Sherrill]] (who also produced "The Chicken in Black"), which were shelved; they would be released by Columbia's sister label, [[Legacy Recordings]], in 2014 as ''[[Out Among the Stars]]''.<ref name="ats">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-lost-album-out-among-the-stars-20131210,0,2223681.story|title='Lost' Early-'80s Johnny Cash Album Slated for March 25 Release|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=December 10, 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Around this time, Cash also recorded [[Believe in Him|an album of gospel recordings]] that ended up being released by another label around the time of his departure from Columbia (this due to Columbia closing down its Priority Records division that was to have released the recordings).

After more unsuccessful recordings were released between 1984 and 1985, Cash left Columbia.

In 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with [[Roy Orbison]], Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''; according to Hilburn, Columbia still had Cash under contract at the time, so special arrangements had to be made to allow him to participate.<ref>Hilburn, p. 506</ref> Also in 1986, Cash published his only novel, ''Man in White'', a book about [[Paul the Apostle|Saul]] and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. He recorded ''Johnny Cash Reads The Complete [[New Testament]]'' in 1990.

After Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with [[Mercury Records]] from 1987 to 1991. During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.

Though Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death, his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a "morale booster"; Rosanne Cash later said "he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it". The album attracted press attention on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/28/johnny-cash-indie-1980s-resurrection |title=The Resurrection of Johnny Cash |last=Thomson |first=Graeme |date=April 28, 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> In 1991, he sang a version of "Man in Black" for the [[Christian punk]] band [[One Bad Pig]]'s album ''I Scream Sunday''. In 1993, he sang "[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]", the closing track of [[U2]]'s album ''[[Zooropa]]''. According to ''Rolling Stone'' writer Adam Gold, "The Wanderer" – written for Cash by Bono, "defies both the U2 and Cash canons, combining rhythmic and textural elements of Nineties synth-pop with a Countrypolitan lament fit for the closing credits of a Seventies western."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Gold |first1=Adam |title=How U2 Fell in Love with Nashville and Influenced Today's Country Music |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-u2s-love-affair-with-nashville-country-music-w491992 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 26, 2019 |date=July 13, 2017 |archive-date=December 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209095057/http://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-u2s-love-affair-with-nashville-country-music-w491992 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

No longer sought-after by major labels, he was offered a contract with producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] label, which had recently been rebranded from Def American, under which name it was better known for rap and [[hard rock]]. Under Rubin's supervision, he recorded ''[[American Recordings (album)|American Recordings]]'' (1994) in his living room, accompanied only by his [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] Dreadnought guitar&nbsp;– one of many Cash played throughout his career.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/the-guitars-of.html |website=Fretbase.com |title=The Guitars of Johnny Cash |date=August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001225814/http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/the-guitars-of.html |archive-date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> The album featured covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin. The album had a great deal of critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 [[Glastonbury Festival]] was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and commercial success. He teamed up with [[Brooks & Dunn]] to contribute "Folsom Prison Blues" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. On the same album, he performed Bob Dylan's  "[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Cash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the television series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. He also lent his voice for a [[cameo role]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)]]", as the "Space Coyote" that guides [[Homer Simpson]] on a spiritual quest.

Cash was joined by guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] of [[Soundgarden]], bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] of [[Alice in Chains]] for a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Red Headed Stranger|Time of the Preacher]]", featured on the tribute album ''Twisted Willie'', released in January 1996.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-01-27-ca-29172-story.html |title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP : 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=January 27, 1996 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 1996, Cash collaborated with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] on ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'' (also known as ''American Recordings II''), which won the [[Best Country Album]] Grammy in 1998. The album was produced by Rick Rubin with [[Sylvia Massy]] engineering and mixing. A majority of ''Unchained'' was recorded at [[Sound City Studios]] and featured guest appearances by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], and [[Marty Stuart]]. Believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography ''Man in Black'', he wrote ''Cash: The Autobiography'' in 1997.

In 1997, during a trip to New York City, Cash was diagnosed with the [[neurodegenerative]] disease [[Multiple system atrophy|Shy–Drager syndrome]], a form of [[multiple system atrophy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Cash: The Autobiography |url=https://archive.org/details/cashautobiograph00cash |url-access=registration |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |date=1998 |orig-year=1997  |isbn=0061013579 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cashautobiograph00cash/page/400 400–403] |author-link=Johnny Cash}}</ref> According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]], and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson's after nearly collapsing on stage in [[Flint, Michigan]], on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 568–570</ref> The diagnosis was later again altered to [[Dysautonomia|autonomic neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]]. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe [[pneumonia]], which damaged his lungs.

During the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'' (2000) and ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' (2002). ''American IV'' included [[Cover version|cover songs]] by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably "[[Hurt (Johnny Cash song)|Hurt]]" by [[Nine Inch Nails]] and "[[Personal Jesus]]" by [[Depeche Mode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/|title=Johnny Cash, ''American IV: The Man Comes Around''|last=Carr|first=Eric|date=November 7, 2002|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=May 12, 2017}}</ref> [[Trent Reznor]] of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash's plan to cover "Hurt", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |title=Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor |magazine=Alternative Press |date=June 26, 2004 |access-date=October 15, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015203101/http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |archive-date=October 15, 2017 }}</ref> The video for "Hurt" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos – Johnny Cash, Hurt|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085375,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214843/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085375,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 26, 2011|magazine=Time|access-date=August 19, 2011|first=Glen|last=Levy| date=July 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|url=https://www.nme.com/list/100-greatest-music-videos/217342/page/10|publisher=[[NME]]|access-date=December 15, 2012|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>

He even performed surprise shows at the [[Carter Family Fold]] outside [[Bristol, Virginia]]. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing "Ring of Fire", Cash read a statement that he had written shortly before taking the stage:

{{blockquote|The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She's never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart.}}

Cash continued to record until shortly before his death. "When June died, it tore him up", Rick Rubin recalled. "He said to me, 'You have to keep me working because I will die if I don't have something to do.' He was in a wheelchair by then and we set him up at his home in Virginia… I couldn't listen to those recordings for two years after he died and it was heartbreaking when he died."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The Q Interview: Rick Rubin|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=October 2009|page=98}}</ref> Cash's final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of "Like the 309", which appeared on ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' in 2006, and the final song he completed, "Engine 143", recorded for his son John Carter Cash's planned Carter Family tribute album.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of [[love letter]]s.{{Sfn|Turner|2004|pp=43–44}} On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. They had four daughters: [[Rosanne Cash|Rosanne]], Kathy, [[Cindy Cash|Cindy]], and Tara. In 1961, Cash moved his family to a hilltop home overlooking [[Casitas Springs, California]]. He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement. Liberto later said that she had filed for divorce in 1966 because of Cash's severe drug and alcohol abuse, as well as his constant touring, his repeated acts of [[adultery]] with other women, and his close relationship with singer [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]]. Their four daughters were then raised by their mother.

Cash met June of the famed [[Carter Family]] while on tour, and the two became infatuated with each other. In 1968, thirteen years after they first met backstage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], Cash proposed to June, during a live performance in [[London, Ontario]].<ref>{{Citation|place=London, UK|last=Sweeting|first=Adam|date=September 12, 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/sep/12/johnnycash|type=Obituary|title=Johnny Cash|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=January 26, 2009}}</ref> The couple married on March 1, 1968, in [[Franklin, Kentucky]].

Cash and Carter continued to work, raise their child, create music, and tour together for 35 years until June's death in May 2003. Throughout their marriage, June attempted to keep Cash off [[amphetamines]], often taking his drugs and flushing them down the toilet. June remained with him even throughout his multiple admissions for rehabilitation treatment and decades of [[drug addiction]]. After June's death in May 2003, Cash believed that his only reason for living was his music; he died only four months later.<ref>Puterbaugh, Parke. "Essential Johnny Cash."

Cash nurtured and defended artists (such as Bob Dylan<ref name="pc10" />) on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment's most visible symbol. At an all-star concert which aired in 1999 on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Dylan, [[Chris Isaak]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Norah Jones]], Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, [[Dom DeLuise]], and U2. Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year. Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; ''[[Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash|Kindred Spirits]]'' contains works from established artists, while ''[[Dressed in Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash|Dressed in Black]]'' contains works from many lesser-known musicians.

In total, he wrote over 1,000 songs and released dozens of albums. A [[box set]] titled ''[[Unearthed (Johnny Cash album)|Unearthed]]'' was issued posthumously. It included four CDs of unreleased material recorded with Rubin, as well as a ''Best of Cash on American'' retrospective CD. The set also includes a 104-page book that discusses each track and features one of Cash's final interviews.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Cash's ''Unearthed'' box set|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68530/cashs-unearthed-box-set-unveiled|magazine=Billboard|date=October 22, 2003|access-date=December 11, 2015}}</ref>

Cash received multiple [[Country Music Association Awards]], Grammys, and other awards, in categories ranging from vocal and spoken performances to album notes and videos. In a career that spanned almost five decades, Cash was the personification of country music to many people around the world. Cash was a musician who was not defined by a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]], and exerted an influence on each of those genres.

His diversity was evidenced by his presence in five major music halls of fame: the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1980), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992), GMA's [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2010). and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] (2013).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/johnny-cash|publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash|access-date=May 2, 2017|archive-date=May 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504125420/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/johnny-cash|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/johnny-cash|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash}}</ref> Marking his death in 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' stated other than [[Elvis Presley]] Cash was the only artist inducted as a performer into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<ref name="RS Cash">{{cite news |title=Johnny Cash: Remembering the Incomparable Legend of Country, Rock and Roll |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/johnny-cash-remembering-the-incomparable-legend-of-country-rock-and-roll-244037/ |access-date=April 1, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

'''John LaGale Horton''' (April 30, 1925 – November 5, 1960) was an American [[country music|country]], [[honky tonk]] and [[rockabilly]] musician during the 1950s. He is best known for a series of history-inspired narrative country saga songs that became international hits. His 1959 single "[[Battle of New Orleans (song)|The Battle of New Orleans]]" was awarded the 1960 [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=624}}</ref> The song was awarded the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients (A-D)#The Battle of New Orleans|Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and in 2001 ranked No. 333 of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s "[[Songs of the Century]]". His first No. 1 country song was in 1959, "[[When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below)]]".

Horton had two successes in 1960 with both "[[Sink the Bismark|Sink the Bismarck]]" and "[[North to Alaska (song)|North to Alaska]]", the latter used over the opening credits to the [[North to Alaska|John Wayne film of the same name]]. Horton died in November 1960 at the peak of his fame in a traffic collision, less than two years after his breakthrough. He is a member of the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] and the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]].

== Early life ==
Horton was born on April 30, 1925,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Johnny Horton Biography, Songs, & Albums |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-horton-mn0000198783/biography |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref> in Los Angeles,<ref name="Larkin" /> the youngest of the five children of the former Ella Claudia Robinson (1892–1966) and John Loly Horton (1889–1959), and raised in [[Rusk, Texas|Rusk]] in [[Cherokee County, Texas|Cherokee County]] in [[East Texas]]. His family often traveled between east Texas and southern [[California]] to work as migrant farm workers. After he graduated from high school in [[Gallatin, Texas|Gallatin]], Texas, in 1944, Horton attended [[Lon Morris College|Lon Morris Junior College]] in [[Jacksonville, Texas|Jacksonville]], Texas, on a basketball scholarship. He later attended [[Seattle University]] and briefly [[Baylor University]] in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], although he did not graduate from any of these institutions.<ref name="Mather 2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/JohnnyHorton1.html|title=Johnny Horton|last=Mather|first=Shaun|year=2004|publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170228032337/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/JohnnyHorton1.html|archive-date =February 28, 2017|access-date=March 8, 2023}}</ref>

Horton soon returned to California and got a job in the mail room at [[Selznick International Pictures]], where his future wife, Donna Cook, was working in the studio as a secretary. After a short stint studying geology in Seattle in 1948, Horton went to Alaska to look for gold. During this period he began writing songs. Returning south, he entered and won a talent contest in [[Henderson, Texas]]. Encouraged by this result, he returned to California to pursue a music career.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

His guest appearances on [[Cliffie Stone]]'s ''[[Hometown Jamboree]]'' on [[KWVE (AM)|KXLA-AM]] and [[KCOP-TV|KLAC-TV]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and his own half-hour show ''The Singing Fisherman'' led to the opportunity to record some songs on the Cormac record label.<ref name="Larkin" /> By the time the company folded in 1952, Horton recorded 10 singles for that label. Fabor Robison, owner of [[Abbott Records]], acquired the master recordings. Around that time, Horton married Donna Cook.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

== ''Louisiana Hayride'' and early career ==
By this time Horton was appearing regularly on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', so he and Donna moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], where the show was recorded. He also signed a contract with [[Mercury Records]] and began recording. His first song for that label, "First Train Headin' South" b/w "(I Wished for an Angel) The Devil Sent Me You" (Mercury 6412), received good reviews. He and his new backup band, the Rowley Trio, began touring under the name The Singing Fisherman and the Rowley Trio in 1952, eventually changing the name to Johnny Horton and the Roadrunners. The group included Horton as lead singer and Jerry Rowley on fiddle as well Rowley's wife Evelyn on piano and his sister Vera (Dido) on guitars. The constant touring was hard on Horton's marriage, and Donna moved back to Los Angeles. They were soon divorced.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

On September 26, 1953, Horton married [[Billie Jean Horton|Billie Jean Jones]],<ref name="Larkin" /> widow of [[Hank Williams]], who had died on January 1, 1953. Horton parted ways with the Rowley trio but continued to appear occasionally on ''Louisiana Hayride''. His contract with Mercury expired in late 1954, with his recording of "All for the Love of a Girl" (Mercury 70227) being his bestseller, at 35,000 to 45,000 copies. Horton, himself always an avid fisherman, got a job in a tackle shop and put his music career on hiatus. But by the following year, his new manager and bassist [[Tillman Franks]] had obtained Horton a one-year contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="Larkin" /> They traveled to [[Nashville]] in a borrowed car for their first recording session. Influenced by the work of [[Elvis Presley]], Horton began adopting a more [[rockabilly]] style.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

== "Honky-Tonk Man" and later career ==
"[[Honky-Tonk Man]]" was recorded on January 11, 1956, at the Bradley Film & Recording Studios in Nashville, one of four songs Horton recorded that day.<ref name="Larkin" /> Session musicians on the recording were [[Grady Martin]] and [[Harold Bradley (guitarist)|Harold Bradley]], as well as [[Bill Black]] (at the time Presley's bassist).<ref name="Larkin" /> Soon afterwards "Honky-Tonk Man" was released as a single (Columbia label: 4–21504) paired with another song from the same session, "I'm Ready if You're Willing". They went out on tour, with the band featuring Franks on bass and Tommy Tomlinson on guitar.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

"Honky-Tonk Man" was reviewed by the March 10 issue of ''Billboard'', which said, "The wine women and song attractions exert a powerful hold on the singer, he admits. The funky sound and pounding beat in the backing suggest the kind of atmosphere he describes. A very good jukebox record."<ref name="Mather 2004" /> Their review of "I'm Ready if You're Willing" was also positive: "Horton sings out this cheerful material with amiable personality. This ever more popular stylist ought to expand his circle of fans with this one."<ref name="Mather 2004" /> The song peaked at No. 9 on the C&W Jockey chart (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) and at No. 14 on the Best Seller chart.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

Horton returned to the studio on May 23, but the "A" side of his next single, "I'm a One Woman Man" (Columbia 21538), was one of the songs recorded back in January. The "B" side was "I Don't Like I Did". ''Billboard'' described "One Woman Man" as a "smart and polished job," and Horton as "singing with a light, airy touch. Guitar work is just as convincing, adding up to listenable, commercial stuff".<ref name="Mather 2004" /> He and his band toured through the United States and Canada to promote the record, which reached No. 7 on the Jockey chart and No. 9 on the Best Seller and Jukebox charts.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

"I'm Coming Home" / "I Got A Hole In My Pirogue" (Columbia 40813) was released around this time as well. On February 9, ''Billboard'' noted that "not only Southern markets are doing good business with this, but Northern cities report that both country and pop customers are going for this in a big way".<ref name="Mather 2004" /> It was again a success on the country charts (No. 11 Jockey, No. 15 Best Seller) but it failed to score the popular music charts.

Later major successes include the song "[[Battle of New Orleans (song)|The Battle of New Orleans]]" (written by [[Jimmy Driftwood]]),<ref name="Larkin" /> which was awarded the 1960 [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. The song was awarded the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and in 2001 ranked No. 333 of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s "[[Songs of the Century]]". Horton had two other successes in 1960 with "[[Sink the Bismark|Sink the Bismarck]]" and "[[North to Alaska (song)|North to Alaska]]" for [[John Wayne]]'s movie, ''[[North to Alaska]]''.<ref name="Larkin" />

== Personal life ==
Horton was married twice. His first marriage, to Donna Cook, ended with a divorce granted in [[Rusk, Texas]].

In September 1953, he married [[Billie Jean Jones]], the widow of country-music singer [[Hank Williams]].<ref name="Larkin" /> Billie Jean and Horton had two daughters, Yanina (Nina) and Melody, and Horton adopted Billie Jean's daughter Jeri Lynn.

[[File:Johnny Horton grave in Haughton, LA IMG 2639.jpg|thumb|Horton's grave marker]]
On the night of November 4–5, 1960, Horton and two other band members, Tommy Tomlinson and [[Tillman Franks]], were traveling from the Skyline Club in [[Austin, Texas]] to Shreveport when they collided with an oncoming truck on a bridge near [[Milano, Texas|Milano]] in [[Milam County, Texas|Milam County]], Texas.<ref name="Larkin" /> Horton died en route to the hospital, and Tomlinson (1930–1982) was seriously injured; his leg was later [[Amputation|amputated]].<ref name="Larkin" /> Franks (1920–2006) suffered head injuries, and James Davis, the driver of the truck, sustained a broken ankle and other minor injuries.<ref name="Mather 2004" />

The funeral was held in Shreveport on November 8, 1960, officiated by Franks' younger brother William Derrel "Billy" Franks, a [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] minister. [[Johnny Cash]] performed one of the readings, choosing Chapter 20 from the [[Gospel of John]] ([[Resurrection of Jesus]]).<ref name="Mather 2004" />

Horton is interred at Hillcrest Memorial Park and Mausoleum in [[Haughton, Louisiana|Haughton]], east of [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] in northwestern Louisiana.<ref name="Larkin" />

== Legacy ==
When Johnny Cash, a good friend of Horton's, learned about the accident, he said, "[I] locked myself in one of the hotel's barrooms and cried."<ref>{{cite book |title=Cash: The Autobiography |first=Johnny |last=Cash |author-link=Johnny Cash |year=2003 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-06-072753-6}}</ref> Cash dedicated his rendition of "[[When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below)]]" to Horton on his album ''[[Personal File]]'': "Johnny Horton was a good old friend of mine." Over time, Horton's material has been rereleased a number of times, through boxsets and compilations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/1956-1960-mr0000022849|title=1956-1960 – Johnny Horton {{!}} Release Info {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref>

Horton was inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] and posthumously inducted into the [[Delta Music Museum]] Hall of Fame in [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], Louisiana.

A five-time [[Grammy]] award-winner, she was a member of the [[Carter Family]] and the second wife of singer [[Johnny Cash]]. Prior to her marriage to Cash, she was known as '''June Carter''' and continued to be credited as such even after her marriage (as well as on songwriting credits predating it). She played guitar, [[banjo]], harmonica, and [[autoharp]], and acted in several films and television shows. Carter Cash was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| year = 2009 | title = Awards|url= http://hallmuseum.com/9awards.htm | publisher= Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum | access-date = April 15, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515174455/http://hallmuseum.com/9awards.htm|archive-date = May 15, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
June Carter Cash was born Valerie June Carter in [[Maces Spring, Virginia]], to [[Maybelle Carter|Maybelle]] (née Addington) and [[Ezra Carter]]. Her mother was a country music performer with June's aunt Sara and uncle [[A. P. Carter]] and she performed with the Carter Family from the age of 10, in 1939. In March 1943, when the Carter Family trio stopped recording together at the end of the [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] contract, Maybelle Carter, with encouragement from her husband Ezra, formed "The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle" with her daughters, Helen on accordion, Anita Carter on bass fiddle and June on autoharp and as front person and comedian. The new group first aired on radio station [[WRNL]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], on June 1. Doc (Addington) and Carl (McConnell)—Maybelle's brother and cousin, respectively, known as "The Virginia Boys", joined them in late 1945. June, then 16, was a co-announcer with Ken Allyn and did the commercials on the radio shows for Red Star Flour, Martha White, and [[Thalhimers|Thalhimers Department Store]], just to name a few.<ref name="JUNE CARTER CASH BIOGRAPHY">{{Citation | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/cash_june_carter/bio.jhtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040106040953/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/cash_june_carter/bio.jhtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 6, 2004 | title = Artists | contribution = June Carter Cash | type = biography | publisher = CMT}}</ref> For the next year {1946}, the Carters and Doc and Carl did show dates within driving range of Richmond, through [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. She attended [[John Marshall High School (Richmond, Virginia)|John Marshall High School]] during this period.<ref>{{cite web | title = Walk the line, drive the road | url = http://www.virginia.org/WalktheLineDrivetheRoad/ | publisher = Virginia | access-date = May 28, 2012 | archive-date = September 12, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150912115216/http://www.virginia.org/walkthelinedrivetheroad/ | url-status = dead }}</ref> June later said she had to work harder at her music than her sisters, but she had her own special talent —comedy.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bufwack | first = Mary | year = 1998 | contribution = Carter Sisters | title = The Encyclopedia of Country Music | editor-first = Paul | editor-last = Kingsbury | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 85}}</ref> A highlight of the road shows was her "Aunt Polly" comedy routine. With her thin and lanky frame, June Carter often played a comedic foil during the group's performances alongside other Opry stars [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Carl McConnell wrote in his memoirs that June was "a natural-born clown, if there ever was one". Decades later, Carter revived Aunt Polly for the 1976 TV series ''Johnny Cash & Friends''.

After Doc and Carl dropped out of the music business in late 1946, Maybelle and her daughters moved to [[Sunshine Sue|Sunshine Sue Workman's]] "Old Dominion Barn Dance" on the [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]] Richmond station. After a while there, they moved to [[WNOX]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], where they met [[Chet Atkins]] with Homer and Jethro.

In 1949, the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle, with their lead guitarist, Atkins, were living in [[Springfield, Missouri]], and performing regularly at [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]]. Ezra "Eck" Carter, Maybelle's husband and manager of the group, declined numerous offers from the [[Grand Ole Opry]] to move the act to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], because the Opry would not permit Atkins to accompany the group onstage. Atkins' reputation as a guitar player had begun to spread, and studio musicians were fearful that he would displace them as a 'first-call' player if he came to Nashville. Finally, in 1950, Opry management relented and the group, along with Atkins, became part of the Opry company. Here the family befriended [[Hank Williams]] and [[Elvis Presley]] (to whom they were distantly related), and June met Johnny Cash.

Carter and her sisters, with their mother Maybelle and aunt Sara joining in from time to time, reclaimed the name "The Carter Family" for their act during the 1960s and 1970s.

While Carter may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |contribution=June |title=Johnny Cash.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813152000/http://www.johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |archive-date=August 13, 2008 }}</ref> Director [[Elia Kazan]] saw her perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and encouraged her to study acting. She studied with [[Lee Strasberg]] and [[Sanford Meisner]] at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in New York. Her acting roles included Mrs. "Momma" Dewey in [[Robert Duvall]]'s 1998 movie ''[[The Apostle]]'', Sister Ruth, wife to Johnny Cash's character Kid Cole, on ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' (1993–97), and Clarise on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' in 1957. She was notable as [[Mayhayley Lancaster]] playing alongside husband Cash in the [[1983 in film|1983]] [[television movie]] ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]''. June was also Momma James in ''[[The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lapostexaminer.com/jesse-james-part-2-dad-especially-mom/2014/08/05 |title=Jesse James: Dad and especially mom (Part 2) |first=Stephen |last=Goode |date=August 5, 2014 |access-date=February 7, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Post-Examiner}}</ref> She also acted in occasional comedy skits for various Johnny Cash TV programs.

As a singer, she had both a solo career and a career singing with first her family and later her husband. As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s, such as "Jukebox Blues" and the comedic hit "No Swallerin' Place" by Frank Loesser. Carter also recorded "The Heel" in the 1960s along with many other songs.

In the early 1960s, Carter wrote the song "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", which later went on to be a hit for her future husband, Johnny Cash. She co-wrote the song with fellow songwriter [[Merle Kilgore]]. Carter wrote the lyrics about her relationship with Cash and she offered the song to her sister, [[Anita Carter]], who was the first singer to record the song. In 1963, Cash recorded the song with the Carter Family singing backup and added mariachi horns. The song became a number-one hit and went on to become one of the most recognizable songs in the world of country music.
In her autobiography, ''I Walked the Line'', Cash's first wife [[Vivian Cash]] disputes the myth that Carter co-wrote the song "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]". Vivian relates the story that Cash told her in 1963: he wrote the song with Kilgore and Curly Lewis while fishing and he was going to give Carter half credit because "She needs the money. And I feel sorry for her."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash, with Ann Sharpsteen |first1=Vivian |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=Scribner |page=338}}</ref>

Carter's first notable studio performance with Johnny Cash occurred in 1964 when she duetted with Cash on "[[It Ain't Me Babe]]", a [[Bob Dylan]] composition, that was released as a single and on Cash's album ''[[Orange Blossom Special (album)|Orange Blossom Special]]''. In 1967, the two found more substantial success with their recording of "[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]", which was followed by a collaboration album, ''[[Carryin' On with Johnny Cash and June Carter]]''. All these releases predated her marriage to Cash, after which she changed her professional name to June Carter Cash. She continued to work with Cash on recordings and on stage for the rest of her life, recording a number of duets with Cash for his various albums and being a regular on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'' from 1969 to 1971 and on Cash's annual Christmas specials. After ''Carryin' On'', Carter recorded one more direct collaboration album, ''[[Johnny Cash and His Woman]]'', released in 1973, and, along with her daughters, was a featured vocalist on Cash's 1974 album ''[[The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me]]''. She also shared sleeve credit with her husband on a 2000 small-label gospel release, ''[[Return to the Promised Land]].''

Although she provided vocals on many recordings and shared the billing with Cash on several album releases, June Carter Cash only recorded three solo albums during her lifetime: the first, ''[[Appalachian Pride]]'', released in 1975, ''[[Press On (June Carter Cash album)|Press On]]'' (1999), and ''[[Wildwood Flower (album)|Wildwood Flower]]'', released posthumously in 2003 and produced by her son, [[John Carter Cash]]. ''Appalachian Pride'' is the only one of the three on which Johnny Cash does not perform, while ''Press On'' is notable for featuring Carter singing her original arrangement of "Ring of Fire".

One of her final appearances was a non-speaking/non-singing appearance in the music video for her husband's 2003 single, "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]", filmed a few months before her death. One of her last known public appearances was on April 7, 2003, just over a month before her death, when she appeared on the [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT Flameworthy]] awards program to accept an achievement award on behalf of her husband, who was too ill to attend.

She won a Grammy award in 1999 for, ''Press On''. Her last album, ''Wildwood Flower'', won two additional Grammys. It contains bonus video enhancements showing extracts from the film of the recording sessions, which took place at the Carter Family estate in [[Hiltons, Virginia]], on September 18–20, 2002. The songs on the album include "Big Yellow Peaches", "Sinking in the Lonesome Sea", "Temptation", and the trademark staple "[[Wildwood Flower]]". Due to her involvement in providing backing vocals on many of her husband's recordings, a further posthumous release occurred in 2014, when ''[[Out Among the Stars]]'' was released under Johnny Cash's name. The album consists of previously unreleased recordings from the early 1980s, including two on which June Carter Cash provides duet vocals.

Her autobiography was published in 1979, and she wrote a memoir, ''From the Heart'', almost 10 years later.<ref name = "mtv" />

'''Jamieson "Junior" Brown''' (born June 12, 1952)<ref>{{cite news |title= Today in history |publisher= [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |date= June 12, 2014 |url= https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/today-history-24100059?singlePage=true |agency= [[Associated Press]]}}</ref> is an American [[country music|country]] guitarist and singer. He has released twelve studio albums in his career, and has charted twice on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country singles charts]]. Brown's signature instrument is the "guit-steel" [[double neck guitar]], a hybrid of electric guitar and [[lap steel guitar]].

==Life and career==
Brown was born in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]]; at an early age his family moved to [[Kirksville, Indiana]].<ref name="juniorbrown1"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmt.com/artists/az/brown_junior/bio.jhtml|title=CMT.com : Junior Brown : Biography|date=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227034135/https://www.cmt.com/artists/az/brown_junior/bio.jhtml |accessdate=May 29, 2023|archive-date=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> He first learned to play piano from his father (Samuel Emmons Brown Jr.) "before I could talk". His music career began in the 1960s, and he worked through that decade and the next singing and playing pedal steel and guitar for groups such as The Last Mile Ramblers, Dusty Drapes and the Dusters, Billy Spears and [[Asleep at the Wheel]] while developing his guitar skills.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} In the early 1980s, he appeared on stage with [[Rank and File (band)|Rank and File]] as the replacement for [[Alejandro Escovedo]]. However, he did not feature on any recordings by that band.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

By the mid-1980s, Brown was teaching guitar at the [[Hank Thompson (music)|Hank Thompson]] School of Country Music at [[Rogers State University]], in [[Claremore, Oklahoma]].

In 1985, Brown created a new type of [[double-neck guitar]], with some assistance from Michael Stevens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stevensguitars.com/models/guit-steel/|title=Guit-Steel|website=Stevensguitars.com|date=April 3, 2009|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/gear/reviews/those-daring-young-men-and-their-doubleneck-guitars-a-brief-history-of-multi-neck-players|title=Those Daring Young Men and Their Doubleneck Guitars: A Brief History of Multi-Neck Players - Premier Guitar|website=Premierguitar.com|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref> Brown called the instrument his "guit-steel". When performing, Brown plays the guitar by standing behind it, while it rests on a small [[music stand]]. The top neck on the guit-steel is a traditional six-string guitar, while the lower neck is a full-size [[lap steel|lap steel guitar]] for slide playing. Brown has two guit-steels for recording and live work. The original instrument, dubbed "Old Yeller", has as its standard six-string guitar portion the neck and pickups from Brown's previous stage guitar, a [[Fender Bullet]]. The second guit-steel, named "Big Red", has a neck laser-copied from the Bullet neck; but in addition to electric guitar pickups, both the standard and lap-steel necks use identical [[Sho-Bud]] lap-steel pickups. There is a pocket in the upper bout of the guitar to hold the slide bar when it is not in use. Brown also commissioned a "pedal guit-steel" which adds pedals to the instrument for more musical control.<ref name="americanamusicshow.com">{{Cite web|url=https://americanamusicshow.com/junior-brown/|title=Junior Brown - Interview and Music|first=Calvin|last=Powers|website=Americanmusicshow.com|date=November 26, 2012|access-date=March 7, 2023}}</ref> Brown has stated that the invention of the guit-steel was always a matter of convenience so that he could play both lap steel and lead guitar during live performances and not directly motivated by a desire to be a "one man band".<ref name="americanamusicshow.com"/>

[[File:Junior Brown 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Junior Brown performing at the 2014 [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] Blues Festival]]
Brown quickly became a local success in [[Austin, Texas]], as the house band at the Continental Club. His debut album was ''12 Shades of Brown'' (1990), released by the British [[Demon Records]]; it was re-released in 1993 on [[Curb Records]] in the United States, followed by ''Guit with It''. In 1996, Brown released ''[[Semi Crazy]]'', and followed it with ''[[Long Walk Back]]'' (1998).

In 1996, Brown was featured on the [[Beach Boys]]' now out-of-print album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'' performing a cover of their 1962 hit "409". The song features Brown playing guitar and singing lead with the Beach Boys singing harmonies and backing vocals.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Brown appeared in the music video for "Honky Tonk Song" by [[George Jones]] in 1996 and also won the CMA Country Music Video of the Year award that year for his video, "My Wife Thinks You're Dead", which featured 6-foot-7-inch Gwendolyn Gillingham.<ref>{{cite news |title= The Return of Junior Brown |publisher= Country Music Television News |date= October 1, 2004 |url= http://www.cmt.com/news/1491681/the-return-of-junior-brown/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225216/http://www.cmt.com/news/1491681/the-return-of-junior-brown/|url-status= dead|archive-date= November 29, 2018}}</ref> Brown played a cameo part in "[[Drive (The X-Files)|Drive]]", the second episode of season six of ''[[The X-Files]]''. Brown's music has been showcased on various television series and movie soundtracks, including ''[[Me, Myself & Irene]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and the 2005 ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|Dukes of Hazzard]]'' remake, in which he also played the narrator.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Although Brown plays such [[neotraditional country]] styles as [[honky-tonk]], [[Western swing]], etc., some of his performances will finish with some [[blues]] and [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] tunes playing as well as [[Surf music|surf rock]] instrumentals.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Beginning in August 2006, Brown joined [[Webb Wilder]]'s tour of American minor league baseball stadiums. He reprised his role in an episode ("World of Hurt, BC") of [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[Xavier: Renegade Angel]]'' created by rock band [[PFFR]]. In April 2008, Brown shot three pilot episodes of a country music program modeled after programs from the early 1960s, in which Brown will play with a [[house band]] as well as guests as host of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/issue/column?oid=oid%3A608447 |title=Off the Record – Music |publisher=The Austin Chronicle |access-date=12 June 2011}}</ref> On October 12, 2012, Brown released the EP ''Volume 10'', containing six new songs.

AMC previewed the video of his new song "[[Better Call Saul]]", on October 5, 2014.<ref name= "saulmusic">{{cite news |last=Shetty |first=Sharan |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/10/05/better_call_saul_music_video_watch_junior_brown_perform_the_breaking_bad.html |title=The Better Call Saul Music Video Is a Great Advertisement, but a Better Song |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=2014-10-05 |access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref> On May 24, 2018, Brown released his 11th album, ''Deep in the Heart Of Me''.

On October 6, 2019, Junior Brown's "guit-steel" guitar, along with his wife's Shenandoah acoustic guitar, was reported as stolen from a vehicle parked at a hotel in [[North Attleboro]], Massachusetts near [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Brown and his wife had been in the area visiting relatives.<ref> {{cite web |url= https://savingcountrymusic.com/junior-browns-iconic-guit-steel-guitar-has-been-stolen/ |title=Junior Brown’s Iconic “Guit-Steel” Guitar Has Been Stolen |date=2019-10-07 |access-date=2024-09-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008042555/https://savingcountrymusic.com/junior-browns-iconic-guit-steel-guitar-has-been-stolen/ |archive-date=2019-10-08}}</ref>

On May 27, 2020, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's listing of 50 Country Albums Every Rock Fan Should Own, honored Brown’s US released album, ''12 Shades of Brown'' (Curb Records, 1993).{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

==Career==
===Early life===
Vaughan was born in [[Oklahoma]], but raised in [[Denver, Colorado]]. His guitar instructor was  [[Bill Frisell]]. In the late 1960s, Vaughan played in a number of rock bands in the nearby [[Littleton, Colorado]], area (where he lived), including a progressive rock group called Amos. Soon after, Vaughan joined a local progressive jazz band, and then began playing country music in local bars.<ref name=KV-roots-2017>{{cite web|url=http://musiccityroots.com/artist/kenny-vaughan/ |title=Kenny Vaughan |work=Music City Roots |access-date=27 April 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118024820/http://musiccityroots.com/artist/kenny-vaughan/ |archive-date=18 January 2015 }}</ref>

'''Lonnie McIntosh''' (July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016), known as '''Lonnie Mack''', was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. He was influential in the development of [[blues rock]] music and [[rock music|rock]] [[guitar solo]]ing.

Mack emerged in 1963 with his breakthrough LP, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. It earned him lasting renown as both a [[blue-eyed soul]] singer<ref name="Davidson">{{Cite web |last=Davidson |first=Merric |date=2016-05-18 |title=Lonnie Mack |url=https://www.toppermost.co.uk/lonnie-mack/ |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Toppermost |language=en-US}}</ref> and a [[lead guitar]] innovator. The album's instrumental tracks included two hit singles, "Memphis" and "Wham". In them, Mack, using "top-quality technique" and "pristine" phrasing,<ref>{{Citation |title=British guitarist analyses Lonnie Mack and Stevie Ray Vaughan live in 1986! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaE2tN8dUx0 |access-date=2023-12-13 |language=en}}</ref> added "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" melodies and runs to the predominant chords-and-riffs pattern of early rock guitar.<ref name="auto">Hagood, "[https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ Lonnie Mack: Remembering His Trailblazing Blues-Rock Guitar Virtuosity]", Website:"Keeping the Blues Alive", April 29, 2016. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826121524/https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ |date=August 26, 2018 }}</ref> These tracks raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency,<ref>Interviewed for [[Duane Allman]]'s 2006 biography, guitarist Mike Johnstone recalled sixteen-year-old Allman's fascination with ''Memphis'', saying: "Now, at that time, there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.'"

Music historian [[Dick Shurman]], as quoted McCardle, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74]", Washington Post, April 25, 2016. Mack was a strong influence on several founders of Southern rock: (1) [[Allman Brothers]] lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]]: "People like Dickey Betts would tell you that without Lonnie they wouldn't be who they were. That goes for all of us." April 23, 2016, posting on Official Warren Haynes website, preserved at http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack; (2) Before finding fame as lead guitarist of the Allman Brothers, seventeen-year-old [[Duane Allman]] honed his soloing skills by playing ''Memphis'' along with Mack's record, repeatedly stopping and starting the record with his foot, until he had mastered Mack's technique. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, p. 10 ''et seq''.). (3) Remembering the unchallenging simplicity of early rock guitar, Allman Brothers co-lead guitarist, Dickey Betts, observed: "I was really gettin' tired of all the beach songs, and "Louie, Louie". Those are great songs, but I'm talkin' about ''guitar-playing''. And then, here come Lonnie Mack, right down the middle of it all. God, what a breath of fresh air that was for me." Betts video commentary at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij-LTAFB9o8; (4) Mack was a significant influence on two founders of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Steve Gaines]] and [[Ed King]]. Odom, ''Lynyrd Skynyrd: Remembering The Free Birds Of Southern Rock'', Broadway Books 2002, at p. 142. Before Gaines' rise to Skynyrd fame, he practiced "playing (''Memphis'') by ear until he could imitate" Mack, who was one of Gaines' "favorite artists". ''Id.'' Gaines can be heard singing and playing Mack's "Why" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAXU_-q3srs.</ref> that soon followed.

Shortly after the album's release, however, the [[British Invasion]] hit American shores, and Mack's recording career "withered on the vine".<ref>Puterbaugh, "[https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-british-invasion-from-the-beatles-to-the-stones-the-sixties-belonged-to-britain-244870/ The British Invasion: From the Beatles to the Stones, The Sixties Belonged to Britain]", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', July 14, 1988. (2) (a) Mack's own popularity had been built mostly on his 1963 instrumentals, ''Memphis'' and ''Wham!''. Davis & Parker, ''[http://www.goldminemag.com/features/instrumentals-when-no-words-were-necessary-pt-2 Instrumentals: When no words were necessary, Pt. 2]'', ''Goldmine'', December 29, 2010. (b) "In February of 1964, the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, and Mack's career withered on the vine." Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues: 1942–1982'', "Rockin' the Blues: Lonnie Mack & Michael Bloomfield", Hal Leonard (Updated Ed., 2007) at p. 124.</ref> He regularly toured small venues until 1968, when ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine rediscovered him, and [[Elektra Records]] signed him to a three-album contract. He was soon performing in major venues, but his multi-genre Elektra albums downplayed his lead guitar and blues rock appeal and record sales were modest. During this period, he became increasingly unhappy with the music business. He left Elektra in 1971, and for the next fourteen years he functioned as a low-profile multi-genre recording artist, roadhouse performer, sideman, and music-venue proprietor.

== Early life and musical influences ==

Shortly before Mack's birth, his family moved from [[Appalachia]]n (eastern) [[Kentucky]] to [[Dearborn County]], [[Indiana]], on the banks of the Ohio River.<ref>During the migration of refugees from the coal mine closures in Southern Appalachia before World War II, most sought jobs in industrialized cities.  However, Mack's parents settled twenty miles downriver from Cincinnati, living and working on sharecropping farms.</ref> One of five children, he was born to parents Robert and Sarah Sizemore McIntosh on July 18, 1941, in [[West Harrison]], Indiana,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Mack, July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016|url=http://www.alligator.com/news/index.cfm/nid/689/t/Lonnie-Mack|website=Alligator.com}}</ref> near Cincinnati, Ohio. He was raised on a series of nearby [[sharecropping]] farms.

Using a floor-model radio powered by a truck battery, his family routinely listened to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' [[country music]] show. Continuing to listen after the rest of the family had retired for the night, Mack became a fan of [[rhythm and blues]] and [[traditional black gospel]] music.<ref>Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back of the Track", Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56.</ref>

He began playing guitar at the age of seven, after trading his bicycle for a [[Lone Ranger]] model acoustic guitar.<ref>(1) Forte, "Lonnie Mack: That Memphis Man is Back", 1978, p. 20; (2) Murrells, The Book of Golden Discs, Barrie & Jenkins, 1978, p.163</ref> His mother taught him basic chords,<ref name="Grimes" /> and he was soon playing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] guitar in the family band.<ref name="McArdle">{{Cite news |last=McArdle |first=Terence |date=2016-04-25 |title=Lonnie Mack, guitarist and singer who influenced blues and rock acts, dies at 74 |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html |access-date=2022-07-29 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Mack recalled that when he was "seven or eight years old" an uncle from Texas introduced him to [[blues]] guitar<ref name="merged1">{{cite AV media |date=March 13, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |title=Lonnie Mack Interview |publisher=John Broughton |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=October 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210105133502/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |archive-date=January 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> and that when he was about ten years of age, an "old black man" named Wayne Clark introduced him to "[[Robert Johnson]] style guitar".

His musical influences remained diverse as he refined his playing and singing styles.

== Career ==

Mack's career-long pattern of switching and mixing within the entire range of white and black Southern roots music genres<ref>His most popular albums, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963), ''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985), and ''Attack of the Killer V'' (1990) were blues-oriented with a rock instrumental bent and a [[traditional black gospel]] vocal bent. ''Dueling Banjos'' (1973) was an album of traditional bluegrass tunes. ''Glad I'm in the Band'' (1969) and ''Whatever's Right'' (1969) were ecletic with an emphasis on country and soul. ''The Hills of Indiana'' (1971) was almost entirely country, with a singer-songwriter emphasis. ''Coco's'' (1983) was a mix of traditional country, acoustic and electric blues, deep soul, blues-rock, and roots-rock. ''South'' (1978) was a mix of country-pop and bluegrass. ''Second Sight'' (1986) and ''Roadhouses and Dance Halls'' (1988) were eclectic mixes of rockabilly, roots-rock, and [[outlaw country]]. ''Home at Last'' (1977) was mostly country. ''Pismo'' (1978) was a mix of country, rockabilly and Southern rock.</ref> made him "as difficult to market as he was to describe."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dansby |first=Andrew |date=2016-12-27 |title=Music and death 2016: You want it darker? |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/columnists/dansby/article/Music-and-death-2016-You-want-it-darker-10820590.php |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Houston Chronicle |language=en-US}}</ref>  He enjoyed periods of significant commercial success as a rock artist in the 1960s and 1980s, but was mostly absent from the rock spotlight for two long stretches of his career (1971–1984 and 1991–2004),<ref>1971–1984 (became low-profile country artist) and 1991–2004 (ceased recording but sporadically appeared in small venues).</ref> during which he continued to perform, mostly in small venues, as a roots-rock "cult figure".<ref>(1) Grimes, "Lonnie Mack, Singer and Guitarist Who Pioneered Blues-Rock, Dies at 74", New York Times, April 22, 2016. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/arts/music/lonnie-mack-singer-and-guitarist-who-pioneered-blues-rockdies-at-https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/arts/music/lonnie-mack-singer-and-guitarist-who-pioneered-blues-rockdies-at-74.html?_r=0; (2) In the 1980s, Mack was "elevated to cult status as a blues-rock guitar hero".

In 1954, at age 13, Mack dropped out of school after a fight with a teacher. Large and mature-looking for his age, he obtained a counterfeit ID and began performing professionally in bars around [[Cincinnati]] with a band led by drummer Hoot Smith.<ref>Larry Nager, "Guitar Greatness", Cincinnati Enquirer (Cincinnati.com), March 13, 1998, as preserved at http://www2.cincinnati.com/freetime/weekend/031398_weekend.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729013715/http://www2.cincinnati.com/freetime/weekend/031398_weekend.html |date=July 29, 2017 }}.

In the early 1960s he became a [[session musicians|session guitarist]] with [[Fraternity Records]], a small Cincinnati label. In 1963, he recorded two hit singles for Fraternity, the proto-blues-rock guitar instrumentals "Memphis" and "Wham!". He soon recorded additional tunes to flesh out his debut album, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. Mack made some notable recordings later, particularly in the 1980s,<ref>''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985) and ''Lonnie Mack Live: Attack of the Killer V'' (1990), were commercially successful and drew critical acclaim.</ref> but his debut album (released October 1963) is widely considered the centerpiece of his career. It became a perennial critics' favorite:

*1968: Guitar: "...in a class by himself."...Vocals: "...sincerity and intensity that's hard to find anywhere."<ref>Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man",''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968</ref> – Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'', calling for re-issuance of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album.
*1987: "With so many trying to copy this same style, this album sounds surprisingly modern. Not many have done it this well, though."<ref>Himes, "Lonnie Mack", ''The Washington Post'', February 20, 1987</ref> – Gregory Himes, ''The Washington Post''
*1992: "The first of the guitar-hero records is also one of the best, and for perhaps the last time, the singing on such a disc is worthy of the guitar histrionics."<ref name="Guterman 1992, p. 34">Guterman, "The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time", Citadel Publishing, 1992, p. 34 (ranking the album No. 16).</ref> – Jimmy Guterman, ranking the album No. 16 in ''The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time''
*2007: "...a spectacular feast of down-home blues, gospel, R&B, and country chicken-pickin'...a unique vision of American roots music [that was] five years ahead of the British blues-rockers."<ref>Rubin, "Inside the Blues, 1942–1982", Hal Leonard, 2007, at page 124.</ref> – Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues, 1942–1982''
*2016: "Of all the Mack material available this is the one [album] I'd regard as absolutely essential."<ref name="Davidson" /> – Dave Stephens, ''Toppermost''

He recorded many additional sides for Fraternity between 1963 and 1967, but few, if any, were broadly released or strongly promoted, and none charted.<ref>Apart from "Memphis" (Billboard #5) and Wham!" (Billboard #24), only two additional Mack Fraternity singles charted: "Honky-Tonk '65" (#78) and "Baby, What's Wrong?" (#93). See, Billboard's "Chart History" list for Mack at http://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719031335/https://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart |date=July 19, 2018 }}.</ref> Three decades later, [[Ace Records (UK)]] packaged the entirety of Mack's Fraternity output (previously released, unreleased, alternate takes, and demos) in a series of compilations.<ref>See, Ace's Lonnie Mack page and links at https://www.acerecords.co.uk/search?query=lonnie+mack.

"It looked like the guitar wizard was ready to bust out when the music world was turned on its ear. [In] February 1964, [[The Beatles]] appeared on the [[Ed Sullivan]] Show, and Mack's [recording] career withered on the vine."<ref>Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues: 1942–1982'', "Rockin' the Blues: Lonnie Mack & Michael Bloomfield", Hal Leonard (Updated Ed., 2007) at p. 124.</ref>

Although his recording career had stalled out, Mack stayed busy as a performer, criss-crossing the country with one-night stands. "The '60s, man, we was full of piss and vinegar, nothing bothered us. We had [[History and culture of substituted amphetamines#In music|bennies]], like the truckers had [and] we just stayed on the road all the time."<ref name="merged1" /> During that time, "[we] performed with just about everybody, [from] [[Jimi Hendrix]] [to] [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Dick and Dee Dee]]."<ref>McNutt, Guitar Towns, University of Indiana Press, 2002, at page 176.</ref> He also took on session work with [[James Brown]], [[Freddie King]], [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]], Albert Washington, and other R&B/soul artists.<ref>See, Mack discography at http://wdd.mbnet.fi/lonniemack.htm.

In 1968, at the height of the blues-rock era, [[Elektra Records]] bought out Mack's dormant Fraternity recording contract and moved him to Los Angeles to record three albums.<ref>Mack's three Elektra albums were ''[[Glad I'm in the Band]]'' (1969), ''[[Whatever's Right]]'' (1969), and ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'' (1971). These were eclectic collections of country and soul ballads, blues tunes, and updated versions of earlier recordings. Both 1969 albums emphasized Mack's vocals and de-emphasized his guitar work. They were modest commercial successes. Mack's final Elektra effort, ''The Hills of Indiana'', was a country album recorded in [[Nashville]] that attracted little attention.</ref> In November 1968, the newly founded ''Rolling Stone'' magazine published a rave review of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album, persuading Elektra to re-issue it.<ref>(a) Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968. (b) Elektra obliged, adding two bonus tracks from 1964 (''Farther On Down The Road'' and ''Chicken-Pickin''), under the title "For Collectors Only".</ref> He was soon performing in major rock venues, including the [[Fillmore East]], the [[Fillmore West]], and the [[Cow Palace]]. He opened for [[the Doors]]<ref>{{Citation |title=The Doors – Blues For Lonnie |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zpNnje-GRs |language=en |access-date=2022-07-29}}</ref> and [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] and shared the stage with [[Johnny Winter]], [[Elvin Bishop]] and other popular rock and blues artists of the time.<ref>(1) Deccio, "Lonnie Mack Dead", April 24, 2016, http://www.inquisitr.com/3029420/lonnie-mack-dead-guitarist-and-vocalist-who-pioneered-blues-rock-dies-at-74/; (2) Poster for Mack's six-day run at the Fillmore West in July 1969 at http://www.classicposters.com/Johnny_Winter/poster/Bill_Graham/180; (3) Poster of Mack's Cow Palace appearance with the Doors and Elvin Bishop at http://www.classicposters.com/Lonnie_Mack; (4) Mack's reference to appearing with C, S &N at the Fillmore East in his 1985 Carnegie Hall interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHAcMm8pxvo.</ref>

It was the [[hippie]] era, however, and Mack's rustic, blue-collar persona made for a rough fit with commercial rock's target demographic. John Morthland wrote: "[All] the superior chops in the world couldn't hide the fact that chubby, country Mack probably had more in common with Kentucky truck drivers than he did with the new rock audience."<ref>(1) Morthland, "Lonnie Mack", ''Output'', March 1984; (2) "Lonnie was a real country boy". Elektra producer Russ Miller, in Holzman, ''Follow the Music'', First Media, 1998, p. 367.</ref> In addition, after two multi-genre Elektra albums (both recorded in 1969) that downplayed his blues-rock strengths, including his guitar, Mack himself was dissatisfied: "My music wasn't working that good then. I ain’t really happy with a lot of the stuff I did there."<ref>Mack, as quoted in McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}.</ref>

At that point in his career, Mack took a break from performing and recording. According to [[Robbie Krieger]], lead guitarist of Elektra label-mate the Doors, Mack was seen during this period "selling Bibles out of the back of his car."<ref>Graff, Doors celebrate 50 years of "Morrison Hotel:" Q&A, The Oakland Press, Oct. 9, 2020, at https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/doors-celebrate-50-years-of-morrison-hotel-q-a/article_2a9bc814-0a4d-11eb-b11f-277180eb19ef.html</ref> He also worked for Elektra's A&R department, helping to recruit new talent.<ref>Upon completing his 1969 albums, Mack assumed a "[[Chet Atkins]]-[[Eric Clapton]] role at Elektra, doing studio dates, producing and A&R." (''Rolling Stone'', "Random Notes", February 7, 1970, p. 4,) In that role, he helped to recruit a number of country and blues artists from Nashville, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Elektra considered the launch of a specialty label to record them. (Holzman, ''Follow The Music'', First Media, 1998, pp. 366–67.) Mack was instrumental in signing [[Mickey Newbury]], but could not generate much interest in some other prospects, including [[Roberta Flack]]. (Houghton, ''Becoming Elektra'', 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246.) He then tried to sign [[Carole King]], but Elektra rejected her on the grounds that they already had [[Judy Collins]]. (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3.) Frustrated, he finally attempted to interest Elektra in gospel singer [[Dorothy Combs Morrison]], the former lead vocalist for the [[Edwin Hawkins Singers]] of "Oh Happy Day" fame. Mack had recorded Morrison singing a gospel-esque version of [[The Beatles]]' "Let It Be", and sought permission to release it; management's response was delayed, however, due to ongoing negotiations for the label's sale to Warner Brothers (Kot, Greg (December 13, 1989). "He Wrote The Book – tribunedigital-chicagotribune" (http://articles.chicagotribune.c{{dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} om/1989-12-13/features/8903170595_1_doors-morrison-hotel-memphis-man-lonnie-mack). Articles.chicagotribune.com. Retrieved August 18, 2015.), allowing a competing label to seize the initiative and release [[Aretha Franklin]]'s own gospel version first. "That bummed me out" (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3), Mack said. According to a close associate, Mack "had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business". (Hear, interview of Stuart Holman (Mack's bass-player in the early '70s), "Lonnie Mack Special", July 16, 2011, at
http://wvxu.org/post/lonnie-mack-special#stream/0.) Finally, Mack resigned from his A&R job. (Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back on the Track", ''Guitar World'', May 1984, pp. 59–60.)</ref> In 1971, with one album left to complete his contract with Elektra, Mack moved to [[Nashville]]. There, he recorded ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'', a multi-genre (but country-flavored) LP with a vocal emphasis.<ref name="Davidson" /> It included only one track showcasing his guitar virtuosity, "Asphalt Outlaw Hero". ''The Hills of Indiana'' attracted little attention.

Mack had begun missing the fun of small-town performance venues early in his time with Elektra<ref>Mary Campbell, "Blues Guitarist Mack Is Back", Terre Haute Tribune-Star, November 2, 1969, p. 66.</ref> and soon soured on the fantasy of rock celebrity status. "[It had] a lot to do with how much value you put on money as opposed to what makes you happy. I wasn't happy. So one of the best-feeling moments I ever had was when that L.A. sign was in my rear-view mirror and I was free again."<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train.&pg=PA73 Mack's departure from the LA rock scene apparently also involved a threatening premonition. Towards the end of Mack's time at Elektra, the label had put together a musical whistle-stop touring group, including Mack, Don Nix, and others, billed as "The Alabama State Troupers and Mount Zion Choir". (Holzman, Follow The Music, First Media, 2000, p. 36.) According to Elektra producer Russ Miller, Mack disappeared six days before the tour was to begin. Miller found him hiding out on his rustic Kentucky farm. Mack refused to join the tour, citing a nightmare during his last night in Los Angeles, in which he and his family had been pursued by Satan. He had awakened in a sweat, finding his Bible opened to a passage warning him to "flee from Mount Zion". Miller, a former evangelist preacher (Houghton, Becoming Elektra, 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246), knew Mack's mind. Returning to California alone, Miller explained: "[Lonnie's] a real country boy. [T]hat was it for Lonnie". (Holzman, ''supra''). Mack wrote a tune relating to this experience. In "A Song I Haven't Sung" (1986), he equated the pursuit of "fortune and fame" with selling one's soul to Satan, allowing the "body to live while your soul is left to rot". The tune appears on Mack's 1986 Alligator album, "Second Sight".</ref> On another occasion, Mack said: "Seems like every time I get close to really making it, to climbing to the top of the mountain, that's when I pull out.

In 1977, Mack was shot during an altercation with an off-duty police officer. The experience inspired Mack's tune, "Cincinnati Jail", a rowdy, guitar-and-vocal rock number that he favored in live performances later in his career.

In 1983, Mack relocated to [[Austin, Texas]], for a collaboration with his blues-rock disciple, guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].<ref>(1) Mack, as quoted in Gettleman, "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack Is A Low-Key Yet Major Influence On Many Musicians", Orlando Sentinel, as reproduced in Desert News/The Salt Lake Tribune, Tues.

(2) Vaughan idolized Mack, calling him "the baddest guitar player I know" (Vaughan, as heard on DVD entitled "American Caravan: Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble", recorded in 1986
at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis. It can be seen and heard ''here'': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkBqTWBIkKw.) and credited much of his own guitar style to Mack.

Vaughan also said, "I got a lot of the fast things I do from Lonnie" (Menn, Secrets From The Masters, Miller-Freeman, Inc, 1992, p. 278, {{ISBN|0-87930-260-7}}). Three years before his death, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. (Vaughan interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcrkPrxj698). As a teen-ager, Vaughan honed his guitar skills by playing along with ''Wham!'', starting and stopping the record-player repeatedly as he attempted to copy Mack's guitar. (Vaughan interview, https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=GImi3eGVbSI, at counter 17:36; Patoski, "SRV: Caught in the Crossfire", 1993, Backbeat: 15–16.) In his teens, [[Duane Allman]] did the same with ''Memphis''. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10 ''et seq''.) Vaughan went on to record ''Wham!'' several times, and called his own instrumental, ''Scuttle-Buttin'', "just another way of playin' [Mack's 1964 instrumental] ''Chicken-Pickin''." (Vaughan, as quoted in review of the album ''Couldn't Stand The Weather'' at http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/stevie-ray-vaughan-couldnt-stand-the-weather-legacy-edition-album-review-265255.

Mack's early guitar recordings remain closely identified with the dawn of virtuoso blues-rock guitar.<ref name=talkinblues>See, e.g., (1) {{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/talkin-blues-lonnie-mack-and-birth-blues-rock |title=Talkin' Blues: Lonnie Mack and the Birth of Blues-Rock |magazine=[[Guitar World]]|access-date=May 18, 2014}}; (2) Guitar Player, "101 Forgotten Greats and Unsung Heroes", January 2, 2007, at https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/101-forgotten-greats-andamp-unsung-heroes; and (3) Brown & Newquist, ''Legends of Rock Guitar'', "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997 at p.25. (4) They were not his only early demonstrations of soloing skill, however. ''Suzie Q'' (1963) and ''Lonnie on the Move'' (1964) are often mentioned, but the former was not promoted as a single and the latter was lost in the tidal wave of the [[British Invasion]]. A third, ''Chicken-Pickin'' (1964), widely considered Mack's greatest early demonstration of fret-board speed, suffered a similar fate. More recently, Jeff Beck regularly performed ''Lonnie on the Move'' during his 2015 and 2016 tours.  It is a direct copy of Mack's own live, 1990 version. Beck probably first heard the tune when it was issued in Britain on the Stateside label in 1964.

While some of Mack's signature performance elements had appeared in early rock saxophone and keyboard solos, a seamless combination of all was essentially unheard in rock guitar before Mack.<ref>(1) "Before Lonnie, the horn guys did all the lead work. He made the guitar the pre-eminent lead instrument". Former Elektra executive James Webber, in Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train%3B&pg=PA73 See also, Sandmel, Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56.

Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man!", Rolling Stone, November 23, 1968.</ref> Rock historian Dave Stephens rates Mack's overall guitar sound "highly distinctive, dare I say, unique; in the early rock era only Link Wray and Duane Eddy could match him for instant recognition."<ref name="Davidson" />

== Mack's role in the evolution of rock lead guitar ==

Although notable commercial success was periodic and fleeting, Mack's early-1960s recordings became rock guitar trendsetters. They raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency, helped propel the electric guitar to the top of soloing instruments in rock, and served as prototypes for the genres of blues rock and Southern rock.

Interviewed for a biography of Southern Rock guitar legend [[Duane Allman]], guitarist and early Allman associate Mike Johnstone recalled the professional impact of Mack's rock guitar proficiency when he and Allman were starting out:<ref>Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10.</ref>

{{blockquote | Now, [in 1963], there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.' }}

Another player of that era observed: "Lonnie Mack made the other guitar-slingers of the day – [[Duane Eddy]], [[Dick Dale]], [[the Ventures]] – sound tame by comparison. Only [[Travis Wammack]] and [[Link Wray]] came close."<ref>Windham, "REVIEW: Lonnie Mack made other guitarists in his day sound tame by comparison", Tuscaloosa News, 11/13/2003, preserved on-line at https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/story/news/2003/11/14/review-lonnie-mack-made-other-guitarists-in-his-day-sound-tame-by-comparison/27851967007/</ref>

Mack's "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" blues guitar sound is also credited with a key role in the electric guitar's rise to the top of soloing instruments in rock. Blues critic Shawn Hagood wrote:<ref name="auto" />

{{blockquote | His playing was faster, louder, more aggressive than anything people were used to hearing. He essentially paved the way for the electric guitar to become a soloing instrument in rock music. A true blues-rock pioneer, the genre would not have been the same – indeed, much of rock music might not have been the same – without his innovative way of treating the electric guitar as a lead soloing instrument in rock – edgy, aggressive, loud and fast. }}

Former Elektra [[A&R]] executive James Webber agrees:<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&dq=schaber+mule+train&pg=PA73</ref>

{{blockquote | Lonnie took rock guitar playing to a whole different level. You had to really play now. [B]efore Lonnie, the sax guys did all of the lead work. He made the guitar the preeminent lead instrument. }}

Mack's early-1960s guitar tracks are said to have set the stage for blues-rock guitar and Southern rock guitar, styles that first enjoyed broad popularity a few years later. From ''Legends of Rock Guitar'' (1997):<ref>Brown & Newquist, Legends of Rock Guitar, "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997, p. 24.</ref>

{{blockquote | [Mack] is essentially the missing guitar link between the twangy, multi-string riffing of rockabilly and the bluesy, string-pushing players of the mid-sixties. He also made the crucial bridge between the black blues and white hillbilly music via his lead work...In all, it is not an exaggeration to say that Lonnie Mack was well ahead of his time in 1963. His bluesy solos predated the pioneering blues-rock guitar work of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and Mike Bloomfield by nearly two years. [Since] ''they'' are considered "before their time", the chronological significance of Lonnie Mack for the world of rock guitar is that much more remarkable. }}

Southern rock ([[Allman Brothers]]) lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] expressed a similar assessment:<ref name="Warren Haynes">{{cite web|url=http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack|title=Warren Haynes – news|website=Warrenhaynes.net|access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>

{{blockquote | Guitar players, true musicians, and real music fans realize that Lonnie was the Jimi Hendrix of his time. Between the era of Chuck Berry and the era of Hendrix there were a handful of guitar players like Lonnie Mack who were making ground-breaking music that paved the way for the [lead guitar] Revolution. People like Dickey Betts and Stevie Ray Vaughan would tell you that without Lonnie they wouldn't be who they were. That goes for all of us. }}

== Mack's 1958 Gibson Flying V Guitar, "Number 7" ==
Mack was closely identified with the distinctive-looking [[Gibson Flying V]] guitar that first appeared in 1958. When he was seventeen, he bought the seventh Flying V off the first-year production line, naming it "Number 7".
Mack was viscerally attracted to the arrow-like shape of the guitar.<ref name="gibson.com">McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}</ref> Mack played "Number 7" almost exclusively throughout his career.<ref>McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson online at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}, May 9, 2007.</ref> The title of Mack's final album, ''Attack of the Killer V'', was a reference to his guitar.

Early in his career, Mack added a Bigsby vibrato bar to the guitar. It required mounting a steel crossbeam approximately six inches below the apex of the "V", giving the guitar a unique appearance. Mack favored thick (heavy) strings, i.e., .010, .012, .018w, .028, .038, .052. He typically only bent the first (higher) two, and used a wound string only for the third. He said that the wound third string was important to his sound.<ref>Russ House, Reverb.com, "Celebrity Owned Gibson Flying V" (detailed specifications of No. 7 and its Mack-approved replicas), 2017 (no month or day shown), at https://reverb.com/item/15750071-celebrity-owned-gibson-flying-v-personal-run-for-lonnie-mack</ref>

== "Blue-eyed soul" vocals ==

Throughout his career, Mack's vocals blended white and black Southern roots influences. One commentator dubbed his singing style "country-esque blues".<ref>Watrous, "Lonnie Mack in a Melange of Guitar Styles", New York Times, September 18, 1988. See also, Davis, ''The History of the Blues'', Da Capo Press, 1995, at p. 246, describing Mack's vocals as those of "a white Hoosier with a touch of black Memphis in his soul."</ref> His best-known vocals were gospel-inspired "blue-eyed soul" ballads. Most failed to chart,<ref>(1) "Baby, What's Wrong?" hit the low end of the charts at 93 in December 1963. See, Billboard's "Chart History" list for Mack at http://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719031335/https://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart |date=July 19, 2018 }}. (2) The blue-eyed soul vocals on Mack's debut album, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963) came at a time when the racial divide in American culture was epitomized by the difference between black and white pop music styles. (Kirkus Review of the book, ''Country Soul'', by Charles L. Hughes, U. of North Carolina Press, 2015, at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-i-hughes/country-soul/). When Mack's first vocal recordings were released in 1963, Mack's gospel-inspired version of the soul ballad "Where There's a Will" was played on R&B radio stations throughout the Deep South. Soon, he was invited to give a live radio interview with a prominent R&B disc jockey in racially polarized Birmingham, Alabama. Mack said that when he appeared at the
radio station, the DJ said, "Baby, you're the wrong color" and canceled the interview on the spot. After that, Mack's vocals received little play on R&B radio stations.

Lovett began his music career as a singer-songwriter. By the early 1980s, Lovett had already distinguished himself in the burgeoning [[Texas]] folk acoustic scene.  He had performed in the New Folk competition at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]] in 1980 and 1982.<ref name = "KFF">"Kerrville Folk Festival Finalist History", compiled by Doug Coppock ([http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220031051/http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp |date=February 20, 2006}})</ref> An American singer, Buffalo Wayne, whom he had met in 1978 during a college trip to Germany, invited Lovett to play with him at the 1983 [[Schueberfouer]] in Luxembourg. One of the [[happening|events]] at the [[funfair]] was an American musical tent.  The owner of that event was a fan of the [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[house band]] J.

Lovett was given an award called an "Esky" for Surest Thing in [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire's]] 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue. The magazine said of Lovett: "The secret of Lyle Lovett's endurance comes down to the three C's: class, [[charisma]] and consistency... In the studio and on stage with his giant orchestra, he's spent two decades gracefully matching genuine songcraft with A-list musicianship".

In 2010, Lovett appeared on an episode of ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]'' that also featured [[John Prine]] and [[Ray LaMontagne]].

In 2011, Lovett was named ''Texas State Artist Musician ''by the Texas Commission on the Arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.texas.gov/initiatives/texas-state-artist/state-musician/ |title=State Musician &#124; Texas Commission on the Arts |website=Arts.texas.gov |access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref>

'''Martin David Robinson''' (September 26, 1925&nbsp;– December 8, 1982), known professionally as '''Marty Robbins''', was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and [[NASCAR]] [[racing driver]]. Robbins was one of the most popular and successful [[Country music|country and western]] singers for most of his nearly four-decade career,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marty-robbins-mn0000858710/biography |title=Marty Robbins Biography |publisher=AllMusic, RhythmOne, LLC |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/marty-robbins-20651271#mainstream-success |title=Marty Robbins Biography |publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/marty-robbins/biography/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228123352/http://www.cmt.com/artists/marty-robbins/biography/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2012 |title=About Marty Robbins |publisher=Country Music Television, Inc., a division of Viacom International Inc. |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref> which spanned from the late 1940s to the early 1980s. He was also an early [[outlaw country]] pioneer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Max|date=2018|title=Down in the Hole: Outlaw Country and Outlaw Culture|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/scu.2018.0034|journal=Southern Cultures|volume=24|issue=3|pages=83–100|doi=10.1353/scu.2018.0034|s2cid=149612754|issn=1534-1488}}</ref>

Born in [[Glendale, Arizona]], Robbins taught himself guitar while serving in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]], and subsequently drew fame performing in clubs in and around his hometown. In 1952, he released his first No. 1 country song, "[[I'll Go On Alone]]". Four years later, he released his second No.1 hit “[[Singing the Blues]]”, and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, "[[A White Sport Coat]]" and "[[The Story of My Life (Marty Robbins song)|The Story of My Life]]". In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", for which he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. The song began Robbins' association with [[Western music (North America)|western]] balladry, a style which would become a staple of his career. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]", "[[Big Iron]]", “[[Devil Woman (Marty Robbins song)|Devil Woman]]” and "Honkytonk Man", the last for which the [[Honkytonk Man|1982 Clint Eastwood film]] is named, and in which Robbins made his final appearance before his death.

Over the course of his career, Robbins recorded more than [[Marty Robbins discography|500 songs and 60 albums]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and was named the 1960s Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. His songs "El Paso" and "Big Iron" were ranked by the [[Western Writers of America]] among the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Robbins was a commercial success in both the country and pop genres, and his songs were covered by many other famous artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. Johnny Cash noted, "there's no greater country singer than Marty Robbins."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cash|first1=Johnny|title=Johnny Cash: The Last Interview: and Other Conversations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74zsDwAAQBAJ|year=2021|isbn=978-1-612-19893-4|page=53|publisher=[[Melville House Publishing]]}}</ref> His music continues to have an influence in pop culture today, featuring prominently in several films, television shows and video games.

Robbins was born Martin David Robinson on September 26, 1925, in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]].<ref name="Biography.com">{{cite web  |title=Marty Robbins |url=https://www.biography.com/musician/marty-robbins |website=Biography |date=August 12, 2020 |access-date=15 December 2021 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Pruett | first = Barbara J. | title = Marty Robbins: Fast Cars and Country Music | year = 2007 | publisher = Scarecrow Press | isbn = 9780810860360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otDFSIwdsSIC&pg=PA522 | access-date = 2014-04-24}}</ref> His parents, John "Jack" Robinson (1889-1975) and Emma Robinson (1889-1970)<ref name=":0" /> divorced in 1937.<ref name="Biography.com"/>

Among the warmer memories of his childhood, Robbins recalled having listened to stories of the [[American West]] told by his maternal grandfather, 'Texas Bob' Heckle (1847-1931),<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2019-01-14 |title=Robert Matthew Heckle |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Robert-Heckle/6000000014254248286 |access-date=2024-06-11 |website=geni_family_tree |language=en-US}}</ref> who was a traveling salesman, raconteur and local [[medicine man]].<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Rhymes of the Frontier|date=1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPxoHAAACAAJ|access-date=2014-10-25|last1=" Heckle|first1="Texas Bob}}</ref> 
Robbins later recalled: "He had two little books of poetry he would sell. I used to sing him church songs and he would tell me stories. A lot of the songs I've written were brought about because of stories he told me. Like 'Big Iron' I wrote because he was a Texas Ranger. At least he told me he was".<ref name="Biography.com"/>

Robbins dropped out of high school in [[Glendale, Arizona]], before his time in the Navy. Robbins would work as an amateur boxer, dig ditches, drive trucks, deliver ice, and serve as a mechanics helper.<ref>"Marty Robbins Obituary" December 8th 1982. The New York Times.</ref>

At 17, Robbins left home to serve in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] as an [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] [[coxswain]] during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. To pass the time during the war, he learned to play the guitar, started writing songs,<ref name=pc10/> and came to love [[Hawaiian music]].

After his [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the military in 1947 and his marriage the following year, Robbins began to play at local [[Music venue|venues]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]],<ref name=pc10/> In the early 1950s Marty moved on to [[Host (radio)|host]] his own show on [[KIHP (AM)|KTYL]] and then his own television show "''Western Caravan''" on [[KPHO|KPHO-TV]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. After [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] made a [[guest appearance]] on Robbins' TV show, Dickens got Robbins a [[record deal]] with [[Columbia Records]].

==Career==

Robbins became known for his appearances at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. Music journalist [[Mary Harron]] wrote the following about him in ''The Guardian'':<ref>{{Cite web| title = Marty Robbins: Country Dude of Nashville. By Mary Harron : Articles, reviews and interviews from Rock's Backpages.| access-date = 2018-06-25| url = https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/marty-robbins-country-dude-of-nashville |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>
<blockquote>Robbins was a symbol of the Nashville establishment that younger [[Country music|country]] fans abandoned in the Seventies for the bleached-denim "[[outlaw country|outlaw school]]" of [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] side of [[Country music|country]] in songs like ''White Sport Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>

In 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5). In addition to his recordings and performances, Robbins was an avid [[race car]] driver, [[Competition|competing]] in 35 career [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] races with six top-10 finishes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Marty_Robbins |title=Career Statistics |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> including the 1973 [[1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400|Firecracker 400]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1973_Medal_Of_Honor_Firecracker_400/W |title=1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400 |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date=1973-07-04 |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> In 1967, Robbins played himself in the car racing film ''[[Hell on Wheels (1967 film)|Hell on Wheels]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061757/ |publisher=IMDb.com|title=Hell on Wheels|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Robbins was partial to [[Dodge]]s prepared by [[NASCAR]] Hall-of-Famer [[Cotton Owens]], and owned and raced [[Dodge Charger|Chargers]] and then a 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]]. He was also the driver of the 60th [[Indianapolis 500]] [[Buick Century]] [[pace car]] in [[1976 Indianapolis 500|1976]]. His last race was in a [[Junior Johnson]]-built 1982 [[Buick Regal]] in the [[Atlanta Journal 500]] on November 7, 1982, a month before his death.

==Death==
Robbins developed [[cardiovascular disease]] early in life. After his third heart attack on December 2, 1982, he underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple coronary bypass surgery]]. He did not recover and died six days later, on December 8, at [[St. Thomas Hospital (Nashville, Tennessee)|St. Thomas Hospital]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].  He was 57 years old.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pareles | first = Jon | date = 1982-12-10 | title = Marty Robbins, Singer, 57; Won a Grammy for 'El Paso' | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/obituaries/marty-robbins-singer-57-won-a-grammy-for-el-paso.html | newspaper = New York Times | location = New York, NY | access-date = 2016-10-12 }}</ref>

==Music and honors==
Although by 1960 Robbins' output was largely western (and some country) music, his initial hits like "Singing the Blues", "Knee Deep in the Blues", "The Story of My Life", "She Was Only Seventeen", and "[[A White Sport Coat|A White Sport Coat and a Pink Carnation]]" were generally regarded as more pop/teen idol material than his hits from 1960 onwards ("El Paso" etc.).

His musical accomplishments include the [[Grammy Award]] for his 1959 hit and signature song "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", taken from his album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. "El Paso" was his first song to hit No. 1 on the pop chart in the 1960s. It was followed up, successfully, by "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]", which reached No. 3 on the pop chart in 1961, becoming his third, and last, Top 10 pop hit. "El Paso" was followed by one prequel and one sequel: "Feleena (From El Paso)" and "[[El Paso City (song)|El Paso City]]". Also in 1961, Robbins wrote the words and music and recorded "I Told the Brook",<ref>{{cite book|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/836715 |title=I told the brook [music&#93; / [by&#93; Marty Robbins; arr. by Alec Baynes &#124; National Library of Australia |year=1961 |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> a ballad later recorded by [[Billy Thorpe]].

He won the [[Grammy Award]] for the Best Country & Western Recording 1961 for his follow-up album ''[[More Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', and was awarded the [[Grammy Award]] for Best Country Song in 1970, for "My Woman, My Woman, My Wife". Robbins was named Artist of the Decade (1960–1969) by the [[Academy of Country Music]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1982, was rewarded three awards at the 17th Annual Music City News Country Awards in 1983, and was given a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] in 1998 for his song "El Paso".

When Robbins was recording his 1961 hit "Don't Worry" at the [[Bradley Studios]] in Nashville, session guitarist [[Grady Martin]] accidentally created the electric guitar "[[Distortion (music)|fuzz" effect]]&nbsp;– his six-string bass was run through a faulty channel in the studio's [[mixing console]]. Robbins decided to keep it in the final version.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&q=%22Don't+Worry%22+%22Marty+Robbins%22+distortion&pg=PA75 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins – Diane Diekman – Google Books |date= February 15, 2012|isbn=9780252094200 |access-date=2015-08-17|last1=Diekman |first1=Diane |publisher=University of Illinois Press }}</ref> The song reached No. 1 on the country chart, and No. 3 on the pop chart.<ref>Joel Whitburn's Top Country Singles 1944–2001</ref>
Robbins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1975. For his contribution to the recording industry, Robbins has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

Robbins has been honored by many bands, including the [[Grateful Dead]] who covered "El Paso" and [[Bob Weir]] & Kingfish who covered "Big Iron". [[The Who]]'s 2006 album ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' includes the song "God Speaks of Marty Robbins". The song's composer, [[Pete Townshend]], explained that the song is about God deciding to create the universe just so he can hear some music, "and most of all, one of his best creations, Marty Robbins."<ref>[http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103040202/http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr|date=January 3, 2007}}</ref> The [[Beasts of Bourbon]] released a song called "The Day Marty Robbins Died" on their 1984 debut album ''The Axeman's Jazz''. Both [[Frankie Laine]] and [[Elvis Presley]], among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song "[[You Gave Me a Mountain]]", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded "You Gave Me a Mountain" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. [[Johnny Cash]] recorded a version of "[[Big Iron]]" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the ''Cash Unearthed'' box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including "I Couldn't Keep From Crying", "Kate" and "Song Of The Patriot". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on [[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|his network TV show]]. "Big Iron" was also covered by [[Mike Ness]] on his album ''[[Under the Influences]]'', on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', gained renewed popularity following its use in the 2010 video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.

His song "El Paso" was featured in the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|series finale]] of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.  'El Paso' was also featured in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' prequel made by the [[BBC]].

Robbins was awarded an honorary degree by [[Northern Arizona University]].

In 2001, singer-songwriter [[Don McLean]] released his album, ''[[Sings Marty Robbins]]'', which features a collection of songs recorded by Robbins in his career.

In 2016, a portion of Glendale Avenue in Robbins' hometown of [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Arizona]], was renamed "Marty Robbins Boulevard".<ref>[https://ktar.com/story/1290175/portion-of-glendale-avenue-renamed-for-legendary-country-singer/ "Portion of Glendale Avenue renamed for legendary country singer"]. [[KTAR-FM]], September 27, 2016.</ref>

Before Robbins died, he held a performance at the [[White House]], alongside famous American singer [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>"Marty Robbins Obituary" December 10th 1982 The New York Times</ref>

He was named Man of the Decade by the [[List of Academy of Country Music Awards ceremonies#1970s|Academy of Country Music]] in 1970.

== Political views ==
{{Further|Ain't I Right}}
Robbins' political views remained firmly right-wing during his lifetime. During the 1960s as the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] strengthened,  Robbins' political views turned to the right.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Meir |first=Kenneth |title=Looking for Meaning in All the Wrong Places: Country Music and the Politics of Identity |url=https://dra.american.edu/islandora/object/auislandora%3A78317/datastream/PDF/download |journal=Social Science Quarterly |volume=100 |date=February 2019 |pages=89–108|doi=10.1111/ssqu.12556 }}</ref> He supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in his [[1964 United States presidential election]] campaign as a southern director for "Stars for Barry". Two of his songs, "[[Ain't I Right]]" and "My Own Native Land" written in the 1960s later became popular songs during the conservative resurgence in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marty Robbins and the Case for PC {{!}} ColumbusFreePress.com |url=https://columbusfreepress.com/article/marty-robbins-and-case-pc |access-date=2023-08-23 |website=columbusfreepress.com}}</ref> The lyrics of "Ain't I Right" describe [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protesters]] as [[fifth column]]ists and [[Communists in the United States|communists.]]<ref name="Lyrics2">{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Ain%27t+I+Right |website=lyricfind.com |publisher=lyricfind |access-date=22 October 2020 |language=en|title=Ain't I Right?}}</ref> After Columbia Records refused to publish his more politically charged songs, Robbins' band member Bobby Sykes recorded the songs for [[Sims Records]] under the name Johnny Freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diekman |first=Diane |date=2012 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&q=marty+robbins+aint+i+right&pg=PA99 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=99 |isbn=978-0252081255 }}</ref>

==Racing career==
Robbins loved [[NASCAR]] racing.  With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted. Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes in his career, with a personal best top 5 finish at the 1974 [[Motor State 360]] in Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1974_Motor_State_360/W |date=June 16, 1974 |title=1974 Motor State 360 |work=racing-reference.info |access-date=February 17, 2021}}</ref>

Robbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens. Robbins had a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973–1974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.

In 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it.  He had knocked the [[NASCAR]]-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he "just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage – Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

Robbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.

In 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].

Robbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in [[Southern California]] and raced on the Vintage [[NASCAR]] club circuit.

In 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' [[NASCAR]] racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].

For the 2016 [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins. For the [[2021 Goodyear 400]], [[Tyler Reddick]]'s RCR #8 [[Nascar]] Cup car carries Robbins' signature magenta and chartreuse livery. For the [[2022 Goodyear 400|2022 running]], [[Corey LaJoie]]’s [[Spire Motorsports]] #7 ran a throwback to Robbins’ infamous 777 car that he ran in his career.

==Discography==
{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}
Robbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.

Robbins' highest-charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, "[[A White Sport Coat]]" charted to #2, and in 1961, "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]" charted to #3.

His final Top 10 single was "Honkytonk Man" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.

He became fascinated with [[Roy Acuff]] and started playing and writing songs. With his brothers, he played concerts around [[Virginia]]. He sometimes wore a buckskin jacket and headband.<ref name="AMG" /> Rising guitarist [[Roy Clark]] worked with Rainwater and together they cut a few [[demo (music)|demos]] for [[Four Star Records|4 Star Records]].<ref name="AMG" /> [[Pop music|Pop]] singer [[Teresa Brewer]] turned his composition "I Gotta Go Get My Baby" into a big hit.<ref name="AMG" /> Others were overdubbed and released on budget record labels.<ref name="AMG" />

Rainwater got his big break in the music business when he performed on [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s programs.<ref name="AMG" /> He won first place on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on May 9, 1955.<ref>Sachs, Bill (May 21, 1955) ''The Billboard'', p. 37</ref> He had a regular role on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' for several years in [[Springfield, Missouri]] beginning in 1955.<ref name="AMG" /> He signed with [[MGM Records]] and recorded a series of songs for the label, including peppy numbers like "Hot and Cold".<ref name="AMG" /> Such songs were showcases for Rainwater's voice, and his energy and versatility led him to record rockabilly.

=== Height of his career (late 1950s) ===
Rainwater was one of country's most noteworthy stars in the late 1950s, when his good looks and [[baritone]] voice made him popular. One of the first country songs he recorded was "[[Gonna Find Me a Bluebird]]", which he wrote.<ref name="Country Music" /><ref name="AMG" /> Released in 1957, the song became a big country-pop crossover hit, making Rainwater among the first country singers to appeal to a pop market.<ref name="AMG" /> The song reached No. 3 on the country chart and 18 on the pop chart.<ref name="AMG" /> It sold one million copies by 1957, and gave Rainwater his first [[music recording sales certification|gold record]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 1">{{cite book | first= Joseph | last= Murrells | year= 1978 | title= The Book of Golden Discs | edition= 2nd | publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London | page= 85/86 | isbn= 0-214-20512-6 | url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr | url-access= registration }}</ref> During the song's success, Rainwater relocated to the [[New Jersey]]-[[New York (state)|New York]] area.<ref name="AMG" /> "The Majesty of Love" (1957) was a duet with [[Connie Francis]], which also sold over one million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book | first= Joseph | last= Murrells | year= 1978 | title= The Book of Golden Discs | edition= 2nd | publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London | page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 95] | isbn= 0-214-20512-6 | url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/95 }}</ref> His next single, "So You Think You Got Troubles", was a successful follow-up on the country charts, but not on the pop charts.

Rainwater performed and toured throughout the rest of the 1950s.<ref name="AMG" /> In 1959, he added three more gold records: "My Love Is Real", "My Brand Of Blues" and "Half Breed" (A cover version of a [[John D. Loudermilk]] song,<ref name="Country Music" />) all sold in excess of one million [[gramophone record|records]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 3">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/117 117]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/117}}</ref> In 1959, Rainwater recorded another Loudermilk song, "[[Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)|The Pale Faced Indian]]". His original version went unnoticed, but later efforts by [[Don Fardon]] and [[Paul Revere & The Raiders]] under the title "Indian Reservation" were hits. Marvin recorded a number of songs with his little sister Patty Rainwater who was almost 12 years his junior. They recorded songs like "Down In The Cellar" as well as some of Patty's compositions like "Because I'm A Dreamer" and "Two Fools In Love".

His voice began to give out, and he developed calluses on his vocal cords.<ref name="AMG" /> As a result, Rainwater and MGM Records parted ways in 1960.<ref name="AMG" /> He went into brief retirement to rest his voice and then recorded sporadically for [[Warwick Records (United Kingdom)]], although without any hits.<ref name="AMG" /> In the 1960s, he recorded for a series of record labels including [[United Artists Records|United Artists]], [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] and [[Sonet Records|Sonet]]; and started his own record company called Brave Records.<ref name="Country Music" /><ref name="AMG" />

=== Later life ===
In the 1970s, Rainwater developed [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]], from which he slowly recovered, and moved to [[Aitkin, Minnesota|Aitkin]], Minnesota. He appeared occasionally at rockabilly festivals in Europe<ref name="AMG" /> and was still loved by many fans.<ref name="AMG" />

Rainwater was the 73rd inductee into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

He died of heart failure on September 17, 2013, in Minneapolis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/arts/music/marvin-rainwater-88-twangy-country-singer-dies.html|title=Marvin Rainwater, 88, Twangy Country Singer, Dies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=2015-08-17 |last1=Slotnik |first1=Daniel E. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldiesmusic.com/news.htm |title=News |publisher=Oldies Music |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021031111/http://www.oldiesmusic.com/news.htm |archive-date=2018-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Marvin had children by his first wife, and three by his second.

Many of his top hits were released in the 1980s, including "[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]", "[[Big Ole Brew]]", "[[Stand Up (Mel McDaniel song)|Stand Up]]", "[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]" (which reached number one on the country chart), "[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]", "[[Stand on It (Bruce Springsteen song)|Stand on It]]", and a remake of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Let It Roll (Let It Rock)]]".

McDaniel's type of country music has been referred to as "the quintessential happy song" in comparison to other country artists who discuss broken hearts and lost loves. When asked why most of his songs were positive in their outlook, McDaniel told the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' that "there's enough things in the world to keep you bummed out" and that his fans did not want to "hear me singing something that's gonna bum 'em out some more."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tIIgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2818,1429291&dq=mel+mcdaniel+real+good+feel+good+song&hl=en|title=Good Ol' Boy|last=Perala|first=Andrew|date=October 19, 1989|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|access-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
McDaniel was born in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]],<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=249}}</ref> a small town in [[McIntosh County, Oklahoma]], and grew up in [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]]. He was inspired to play music after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] on television. His first interest in music was when he learned the trumpet in the fourth grade, but he soon learned the guitar.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> At age 14, he taught himself the guitar chords to "[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]" and performed at a high-school talent contest. He made his professional debut at age 15 performing in a talent contest at Okmulgee High School. While in high school, he played in several local bands, and after graduation, began working as a musician in [[Tulsa]] clubs. While in Tulsa, he recorded several singles for local label [[J.J. Cale]] and wrote and produced his first single, "Lazy Me".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

===Career===
After marrying his high school sweetheart, McDaniel began performing in Tulsa. From there, he had an unsuccessful trip to Nashville, followed by quite a bit of success in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], performing at clubs among the oil fields.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> After two years there, he returned to Nashville and landed a job as a demo singer and songwriter with Combine Music. With the help of music publisher [[Bob Beckham]], McDaniel signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1976 and released his first single, "Have a Dream on Me".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

His career finally took off with "[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]" in 1981, and in early 1985 he scored his only number one hit with "[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Other Top 10 hits include "[[Right in the Palm of Your Hand]]" (later covered by [[Alan Jackson]] in 1999), "[[Take Me to the Country (song)|Take Me to the Country]]", "[[Big Ole Brew]]", "[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]", and "[[Real Good Feel Good Song]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

McDaniel became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on January 11, 1986, and made frequent appearances on the show.

McDaniel was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, along with induction classmate [[Leon Russell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |title=By Year |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194034/http://www.oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>

'''Albert Narvel Felts''' (born November 11, 1938)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=138}}</ref> is an American [[country music]] and rockabilly<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/narvelfelts.html|title=Narvel Felts|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> singer. Known for his soaring tenor and high falsetto, Felts enjoyed his greatest success during the 1970s, most famously 1975's "[[Reconsider Me]]".

==Career==
He was born in [[Keiser, Arkansas]], United States,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and raised in [[Bernie, Missouri]], where he attended Bernie High School, Felts was discovered during a talent show at the school.<ref name="AMG">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/narvel-felts-mn0000375287/biography|title=Narvel Felts &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref> He had been encouraged to participate in the show by some of his classmates, and a talent agent happened to be attending the performance at the time.

Felts recorded his first single, "Kiss-a Me Baby", at the age of 18,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and his career skyrocketed with the help of [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Johnny Cash]].  Felts enjoyed modest pop success in 1960 with a remake of the Drifters' "Honey Love",<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> which earned a low position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. He went on to release such songs as "Lonely Teardrops" and "Pink And Black Days", but he did not begin enjoying success on a national level as a country singer until the 1970s.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> His first major hit came in 1973, with a cover of Dobie Gray's "[[Drift Away]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Felts' version – number eight on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in September 1973 – was midtempo country compared to Gray's blues version. The follow-up single, "All in the Name of Love", just missed hitting the top 10 in December 1973.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

Felts continued to enjoy modest success during the next year and a half, when he signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Dot Records]] in 1975.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> That year, he enjoyed his biggest hit, a cover of [[Johnny Adams]]' soul classic "Reconsider Me",<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> which showcased his falsetto and high tenor. The song reached number two that August, and was 1975's second-biggest country hit of the year.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1975 |title=Billboard.com - Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=April 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063352/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1975 |archive-date=December 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Felts, who became known to fans as "Narvel the Marvel", continued to enjoy success throughout the 1970s. Included in his streak of hits was a remake of "[[Lonely Teardrops]]", which became his last top-10 hit in the summer of 1976, and a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> He also had a number-14 country hit with "[[Everlasting Love]]" in 1979.

Narvel Felts' pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

==Personal life==
He is married to the former Loretta Stanfield. 

Two children resulted from their marriage, although they lost their only son at the age of 31, Albert Narvel Jr. (known as Bub), on September 14, 1995, as the result of an automobile accident.  At one time, Bub played drums for his father.[1] 

One of his albums is dedicated to his son. 

He currently resides in [[Malden, Missouri]], where he continues to perform on occasion.

'''Patsy Cline''' (born '''Virginia Patterson Hensley'''; September 8, 1932 – March 5, 1963) was an American singer from the state of Virginia. She is considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first [[country music]] artists to [[crossover (music)|cross over]] into [[pop music]].<ref>CBS News (February 18, 2009). 
[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/remembering-patsy-cline/ "Remembering Patsy Cline"] . Retrieved January 16, 2012.</ref><ref>Browne, Ray; Browne, Pat (eds.) (2001). ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture''. Popular Press. p. 180. {{ISBN|978-0-87972-821-2}}.</ref> Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.

Cline's first professional performances began at local radio station [[WINC (AM)|WINC]] when she was fifteen. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country'' television broadcasts. She signed her first recording contract with the [[Four Star Records|Four Star]] label in 1954, and had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including "[[A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye]]" (1955) and "I've Loved and Lost Again" (1956). In 1957 Cline made her first national television appearance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''. After performing "[[Walkin' After Midnight]]", the single became her first major hit on both the country and pop charts.

Cline's further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. After marrying in 1957 and giving birth in 1958, she moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and then moved to [[Decca Records]] in 1960. Under the direction of producer [[Owen Bradley]], her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single "[[I Fall to Pieces]]" became her first to top the ''Billboard'' country chart. As the song became a hit, Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After she recovered, her next single "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]" also became a major hit.

During 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with "[[She's Got You]]", "[[When I Get Through with You]]", "[[So Wrong]]" and "[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]". She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. In March 1963, Cline was killed in [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|a plane crash]] along with country performers [[Cowboy Copas]], [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]], and manager Randy Hughes, during a flight from [[Kansas City, Missouri]], back to Nashville.

Since her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected, and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news  | last= Duke | first= Alan| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/17/showbiz/kitty-wells-legacy |title=Kitty Wells blazed country path for women |work=CNN|date=July 18, 2012 |access-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref> She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In the 1980s, Cline's posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]'' starring [[Jessica Lange]]. Several documentaries and stage shows about her have been made, including the 1988 musical ''Always...Patsy Cline''. A 1991 box set of her recordings received critical acclaim. Her [[Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits|greatest hits album]] sold over 10 million copies in 2005. In 2011, Cline's [[Patsy Cline House|childhood home]] in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] was restored as a museum for visitors and fans to tour.

She temporarily lived with her mother's family in [[Gore, Virginia]], before relocating many times throughout the state. In her childhood, the family relocated where Samuel Hensley, a blacksmith, could find employment, including [[Elkton, Virginia|Elkton]], [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. When the family had little money, she would find work, including at an Elkton poultry factory, where her job was to pluck and cut chickens.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=8}} The family moved often before finally settling in [[Winchester, Virginia]], on South Kent Street.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1985/09/29/sweet-dreams/7eb27412-edbb-42fd-b117-7c3c5dd15655/|title=Sweet Dreams|last=McGhee|first=Dorothy|date=September 29, 1985|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Cline would later report that her father sexually abused her.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame">{{cite web |title=Patsy Cline – Country Music Hall of Fame |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/patsy-cline/ |website=[[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] |access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> When confiding the abuse to friend [[Loretta Lynn]], Cline told her, "take this to your grave."

At age 13, Cline was hospitalized with a throat infection and [[rheumatic fever]]. Speaking of the incident in 1957 she said, "I developed a terrible throat infection and my heart even stopped beating. The doctor put me in an oxygen tent. You might say it was my return to the living after several days that launched me as a singer. The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like [[Kate Smith]]'s."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=9}}<ref name="U Discover">{{cite web |last1=U Discover Staff |title=50 Facts About Patsy Cline |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/50-facts-about-patsy-cline/ |website=U Discover |access-date=August 16, 2019}}</ref> It was during this time she developed an interest in singing. She started performing with her mother in the local Baptist choir. Mother and daughter also performed duets at church social events.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=9}} She also taught herself how to play the [[piano]].<ref name="Biography">{{cite web |title=Patsy Cline – Singer, Pianist |url=https://www.biography.com/musician/patsy-cline |website=[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]] |access-date=August 16, 2019}}</ref>

With the new performing opportunities, Cline's interest in singing grew, and at the age of 14, she told her mother that she was going to audition for the local radio station. Her first radio performances were at [[WINC (AM)|WINC]] in the Winchester area. According to WINC's radio disc jockey Joltin' Jim McCoy, Cline appeared in the station's waiting room one day and asked to audition. McCoy was impressed by her audition performance, reportedly saying, "Well, if you've got nerve enough to stand before that mic and sing over the air live, I've got nerve enough to let you."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}} While performing on the radio, Cline also started appearing in talent contests and created a nightclub cabaret act similar to performer [[Helen Morgan (singer)|Helen Morgan's]].<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/>

Cline's parents had marital conflicts during her childhood and by 1947 her father had deserted the family. Author Ellis Nassour of the biography ''Honky Tonk Angel: An Intimate Story of Patsy Cline'' reported Cline had a "beautiful relationship" with her mother. In his interviews with Hilda Hensley, he quoted Cline's mother as saying they "were more like sisters" than parent and child.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}} Cline attended the ninth grade at [[John Handley High School]] in Winchester, Virginia.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> However, the family had trouble sustaining an income after her father's desertion, and Cline dropped out of high school to help support the family. She began working at Gaunt's Drug Store in the Winchester area as a clerk and [[soda jerk]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=11}}

==Career==
===1948–1953: Early career===
At age 15, Cline wrote a letter to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] asking for an audition. She told local photographer Ralph Grubbs about the letter, "A friend thinks I'm crazy to send it. What do you think?" Grubbs encouraged Cline to send it. Several weeks later, she received a return letter from the Opry asking for pictures and recordings.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=12}} At the same time, [[Gospel music|Gospel]] performer [[Wally Fowler]] headlined a concert in her hometown. Cline convinced concert employees to let her backstage where she asked Fowler for an audition.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Following a successful audition, Cline's family received a call asking for her to audition for the Opry. She traveled with her mother, two siblings, and a family friend on an eight-hour journey to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. With limited finances, they drove overnight and slept in a Nashville park the following morning. Cline auditioned for Opry performer [[Moon Mullican]] the same day. The audition was well-received and Cline expected to hear from the Opry the same day. However, she never received news and the family returned to Virginia.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=13–17}}

By the early 1950s, Cline continued performing around the local area. In 1952, she asked to audition for local country bandleader Bill Peer. Following her audition, she began performing regularly as a member of Bill Peer's Melody Boys and Girls.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=10}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} The pair's relationship turned romantic, continuing an affair for several years. Nonetheless, the pair remained married to their spouses.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}}{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=21}} Peer's group played primarily at the [[Moose Lodge]] in [[Brunswick, Maryland]] where she would meet her first husband, Gerald Cline. Peer encouraged her to have a more appropriate stage name. She changed her first name from Virginia to Patsy (taken from her middle name "Patterson"). She kept her new last name, Cline. Ultimately, she became professionally known as "Patsy Cline".<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/><ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

In August 1953, Cline was a contestant in a local country music contest. She won 100 dollars and the opportunity to perform as a regular on [[Connie B. Gay]]'s ''Town and Country Time''.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=20}} The show included country stars [[Jimmy Dean]], [[Roy Clark]], [[George Hamilton IV]] and [[Billy Grammer]],<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> and was filmed in [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. She was not officially added to the program's television shows until October 1955.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=46}} Cline's television performances received critical acclaim. ''[[The Washington Star]]'' magazine praised her stage presence, commenting, "She creates the moods through movement of her hands and body and by the lilt of her voice, reaching way down deep in her soul to bring forth the melody. Most female country music vocalists stand motionless, sing with monotonous high-pitched nasal twang. Patsy's come up with a throaty style loaded with motion and E-motion."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=52}}

===1954–1960: Four Star Records===
In 1954, Bill Peer created and distributed a series of demonstration tapes with Cline's voice on it. A tape was brought to the attention of Bill McCall, president of [[Four Star Records]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=30}} On September 30, 1954, she signed a two-year recording contract with the label alongside Peer and her husband Gerald Cline.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Gayle |title=Country Music Memories: Patsy Cline Signs First Recording Contract |url=https://theboot.com/patsy-cline-first-recording-contract/ |website=The Boot |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> The original contract allowed Four Star to receive most of the money for the songs she recorded.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |last1=Ward |first1=Ed |title=Patsy Cline: A Country Career Cut Short |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129526320 |website=[[NPR]] |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> Therefore, Cline received little of the royalties from the label, totaling out to 2.34 percent on her recording contract.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=32}}<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> Her first recording session took place in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] on January 5, 1955. Songs for the session were handpicked by McCall and [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]]. Four Star leased the recordings to the larger [[Decca Records]]. For those reasons [[Owen Bradley]] was chosen as the session's [[Record producer|producer]], a professional relationship that would continue into the 1960s.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=33}} Her first single release was 1955's "[[A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye]]". Although Cline promoted it with an appearance on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], the song was not successful.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=38–42}}<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/>

Cline recorded a variety of musical styles while recording for Four Star. This included genres such as [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rockabilly]], [[country music|traditional country]], and [[pop music|pop]].{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Writers and music journalists have had mixed responses on Cline's Four Star material. Robert Oermann and Mary Bufwack of ''Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music'' called the label's choice of material "mediocre". They also commented that Cline seemed to have "groped for her own sound on the label".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Kurt Wolff of ''Country Music the Rough Guide'' commented that the music was "sturdy enough, but they only hinted at the potential that lurked inside her.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} Richie Unterberger of ''[[Allmusic]]'' claimed it was Cline's voice that made the Four Star material less appealing: "Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer, lacking the conviction of [[Wanda Jackson]] or the spunk of [[Brenda Lee]]. In fact, in comparison with her best work, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles."<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{cite web |last1=Unterberger |first1=Richie |title=Patsy Cline: Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/patsy-cline-mn0000014651/biography |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref>
[[File:Patsy Cline II.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photograph, March 1957]]

Between 1955 and 1956, Cline's four singles for Four Star failed to become hits. However, she continued performing regionally, including on the ''Town and Country Jamboree''.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> In 1956, she appeared on ABC's Country Music Jubilee, ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1994|p={{page needed|date=September 2022}}}} It was at one of her local performances that she met her second husband, [[Charlie Dick]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=52–57}} In 1956, Cline received a call to perform on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'', a national television show she had auditioned for several months prior. She accepted the offer, using her mother Hilda Hensley as her [[talent scout]] for the show.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=66–67}} According to the show's rules, talent scouts could not be family members. For those reasons, Cline's mother lied in order to appear on the show. When [[Arthur Godfrey]] asked if Hensley had known Cline her entire life, she replied, "Yes, just about!"<ref name="10 Things">{{cite magazine |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen L. |title=10 Things We Learned From the New Patsy Cline Documentary |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/10-things-we-learned-from-the-new-patsy-cline-documentary-126274/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 3, 2017 |access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref>

Cline and Mrs. Hensley flew into [[LaGuardia Airport]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]] on January 18, 1957. She made her debut appearance on the program on January 21.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/><ref name = smithsonian1>''Mother Country'' by Amanda Petrusich Smithsonian magazine April–May 2022 edition  Pages 32-34</ref>  The day of the show, she met with the show's producer [[Janette Davis]]. Cline had chosen "[[A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)]]" to perform on the program, but Davis preferred another song she had recorded, "[[Walkin' After Midnight]]". Cline initially refused to perform it, but ultimately agreed to it.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=71–73}} Davis also suggested Cline wear a cocktail dress instead of the cowgirl outfit created by her mother.<ref name="10 Things"/> She performed "Walkin' After Midnight" and won the program's contest that night.<ref name = smithsonian1/> The song had not yet been released as a single. In order to keep up with public demand, Decca Records rush-released the song as a single on February 11.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=74–80}} The song ultimately became Cline's breakthrough hit, peaking at number 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart. The song also reached number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' pop music chart]].<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> The song has since been considered a classic in [[country music]] since its release.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

Music critics and writers have positively praised "Walkin' After Midnight". Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann called the song "bluesy".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} Richie Unterberger noted "it's well-suited for the almost bemused aura of loneliness of the lyric."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Unterberger |first1=Richie |title="Walkin' After Midnight": Patsy Cline: Song Info |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/walkin-after-midnight-mt0050772759 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> The success of "Walkin' After Midnight" brought Cline numerous appearances on shows and major networks. She continued working for [[Arthur Godfrey]] over the next several months. She also appeared on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in February and the television program ''Western Ranch Party'' in March.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=80–81}} The money she had earned from her numerous engagements totaled out to ten thousand dollars.

Cline's follow-up singles to "Walkin' After Midnight" did not yield any success.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/> This was partially due to the quality of material chosen for her to record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patsy Cline's aching voice blazed country music trail |url=https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/door-county/entertainment/2014/10/14/patsy-clines-aching-voice-blazed-country-music-trail/17055635/ |website=Green Bay Press Gazette |access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> Cline was dissatisfied with the limited success following "Walkin' After Midnight". Bradley recounted how she often came to him saying, "Hoss, can't you do something?

Her first release on Decca was 1961's "[[I Fall to Pieces]]".{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} The song was written by newly established Nashville songwriters [[Hank Cochran]] and [[Harlan Howard]]. "I Fall to Pieces" had first been turned down by [[Roy Drusky]] and [[Brenda Lee]] before Cline cut it in November 1960. At the recording session, she worried about the song's production, particularly the background vocals performed by [[The Jordanaires]].<ref name="I Fall to Pieces">{{cite magazine |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen L. |title=Flashback: Patsy Cline's 'I Fall to Pieces' Hits Number One |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-patsy-clines-i-fall-to-pieces-hits-number-one-34935/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 10, 2015 |access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> After much arguing between both Cline and Bradley, they negotiated that she would record "I Fall to Pieces" (a song Bradley favored) and "Lovin' in Vain" (a song she favored).{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=133–134}} Released as a single in January 1961, "I Fall to Pieces" attracted little attention upon its initial issue.

On June 14, 1961, Cline and her brother Sam Hensley Jr. were involved in an automobile accident.<ref name="Car Crash">{{cite web |last1=Whitaker |first1=Sterling |title=Remember the Car Accident That Nearly Ended Patsy Cline's Career |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/patsy-cline-car-crash/ |website=Taste of Country |date=June 14, 2018 |access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> Cline had brought her mother, sister and brother to see her new Nashville home the day before. On the day of the accident, Cline and her brother went shopping to buy material for her mother to make clothing. Upon driving home, their car was struck head-on by another vehicle.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=148}} The impact threw her directly into the car windshield, causing extensive facial injuries. Among her injuries, Cline suffered a broken wrist, dislocated hip and a large cut across her forehead, barely missing her eyes. Friend [[Dottie West]] heard about the accident via the radio and rushed to the scene, helping to remove pieces of broken glass from Cline's hair.<ref name="Car Crash"/> When first responders arrived, Cline insisted the driver in the other vehicle be treated first.<ref name="Car Crash"/> Two of the three passengers riding in the car that struck Cline died after arriving at the hospital. When she was brought to the hospital, her injuries were life-threatening and she was not expected to live. She underwent surgery and survived. According to her husband Charlie Dick, upon waking up she said to him, "Jesus was here, Charlie. Don't worry. He took my hand and told me, 'No, not now. I have other things for you to do.'" She spent a month recovering in the hospital.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=148–158}}

===1961–1963: Career peak===
Cline returned to her career six weeks after her 1961 car accident. Her first public appearance was on the Grand Ole Opry where she assured fans she would continue performing.<ref name="Car Crash"/> She said to the audience that night, "You're wonderful. I'll tell you one thing: the greatest gift, I think, that you folks coulda given me was the encouragement that you gave me. Right at the very time I needed you the most, you came through with the flying-est colors. And I just want to say you'll just never know how happy you made this ol' country gal."{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=220}}

Cline's follow-up single to "I Fall to Pieces" was the song "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]".{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} It was written by [[Willie Nelson]], whose version of the song was first heard by Dick.

"Crazy" and Cline's further Decca recordings have received critical praise. Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann noted "Her thrilling voice invariably invested these with new depth. Patsy's dramatic volume control, stretched-note effects, sobs, pauses and unique ways of holding back, then bursting into full-throated phrases also breathed new life into country chestnuts like "[[San Antonio Rose]]", "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]", and "[[Half as Much]]". {{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=220}} Richie Unterberger of AllMusic commented that her voice "sounded richer, more confident, and more mature, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations."<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> Kurt Wolff of ''Country Music the Rough Guide'' reported that Owen Bradley recognized potential in Cline's voice and once he gained studio control, he smoothed arrangements and "refined her voice into an instrument of torch-singing glory."{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}}

In November 1961, she was invited to perform as part of the Grand Ole Opry's show at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]]. She was joined by Opry stars [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Grandpa Jones]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Marty Robbins]], and [[Faron Young]]. Despite positive reviews, ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] commented, "everybody should get out of town because the hillbillies are coming!" The comment upset Cline but did not affect ticket sales; the Opry performance sold out. By the end of year, Cline had won several major industry awards including "Favorite Female Vocalist" from ''Billboard Magazine'' and ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox Magazine]]''{{'}}s "Most Programmed Female Artist".{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=170–176}}

See Liner Notes, ''12 Greatest Hits,'' Patsy Cline, compact disc MCAD-12, MCA Records.</ref> was "[[She's Got You]]". Written by [[Hank Cochran]], he pitched the song to Cline over the phone.

She bought a ranch house located in [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee]], a suburb of Nashville. The home was decorated by Cline and included a music room, several bedrooms and a large backyard. According to [[Dottie West]], "the house was her mansion, the sign she'd arrived."{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=170}} Cline called it her "dream home" and often had friends over to visit.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=221}} After her death, the house was sold to country artist [[Wilma Burgess]].<ref name="Rare Patsy Recording">{{cite web |last1=Pursell |first1=Kate |last2=Knight-Ridder |title=RARE PATSY CLINE RECORDING EMERGES |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-09-07-9709110132-story.html |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 7, 1997 |access-date=August 25, 2019}}</ref>

In the summer of 1962, manager Randy Hughes got her a role in a country music vehicle film. It also starred Dottie West, [[Webb Pierce]] and [[Sonny James]]. After arriving to film in [[DeLand, Florida]], the producer "ran off with the money," according to West. The movie was never made. In August, her third studio album ''[[Sentimentally Yours]]'' was released. It featured "She's Got You", as well as several country and pop standards. According to biographer Ellis Nassour, her royalties "were coming in slim" and she needed "financial security." Therefore, Randy Hughes arranged Cline to work at the [[The Mint Las Vegas|Merri-Mint Theatre]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] for 35 days. Cline would later dislike the experience. During the engagement, she developed a dry throat. She also was homesick and wanted to spend time with her children.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=198–208}} By appearing at the engagement, Cline became the first female country artist to headline her own show in Las Vegas.<ref name="NPR"/>

During this period Cline was said to have experienced premonitions of her own death. Dottie West, [[June Carter Cash]], and Loretta Lynn recalled Cline telling them she felt a sense of impending doom and did not expect to live much longer.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Country Music.'' Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 98–9.</ref> In letters, she would also describe the happiness of her new career successes. In January 1963, her next single "[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]" was released and debuted on the ''Billboard'' country chart soon after. In February, she recorded her final sessions for Decca Records. Among the songs recorded were "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]", "[[He Called Me Baby]]", and "[[Faded Love]]". Cline arranged for friends [[Jan Howard]] and Dottie West to come and hear the session playbacks. According to Howard, "I was in awe of Patsy. You know, afterward you're supposed to say something nice. I couldn't talk. I was dumbfounded."{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=221}}

[[Dottie West]] was another female country artist with whom Cline became friends. They first met backstage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]].

Cline was married twice. Her first marriage was to Gerald Cline, on March 7, 1953.<ref name="Country Music Hall of Fame"/>  His family had owned a contracting and excavating company in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. According to Cline's brother Sam, he liked "flashy cars and women." The two met while she was performing with Bill Peer at the Moose Lodge in [[Brunswick, Maryland]].

The pair began living separately by the end of 1956 and divorced in 1957.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=45}}

==Death==
{{Main|1963 Camden PA-24 crash}}

[[File:Patsy Cline Memorial Camden TN 09.jpg|thumb|left|Patsy Cline aircraft crash site, Camden, Tennessee]]

On March 3, 1963, Cline performed a benefit at the [[Memorial Hall (Kansas City, Kansas)|Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall]], [[Kansas City, Kansas]], for the family of disc jockey "Cactus" Jack Call; he had died in an automobile crash a little over a month earlier. Also performing in the show were [[George Jones]], George Riddle and The Jones Boys, [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]], [[Dottie West]], [[Wilma Lee Cooper|Wilma Lee]] and [[Stoney Cooper]], George McCormick, the [[Ralph Stanley|Clinch Mountain Boys]] as well as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]]. Despite having a cold, Cline performed at 2:00, 5:15, and 8:15 pm. All the shows were standing-room only. For the 2 p.m. show, she wore a sky-blue tulle-laden dress; for the 5:15 show, a red dress; and for the closing show at 8 p.m., Cline wore white chiffon. Her final song was the last she had recorded the previous month, "I'll Sail My Ship Alone".{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=218–221}}

Cline, who had spent the night at the [[Cross Lines Tower|Town House Motor Hotel]], was unable to fly out the day after the concert because [[Fairfax Airport]] was fogged in. West asked Patsy to ride in the car with her and her husband, Bill, back to Nashville, an 8-hour drive, but Cline refused, saying: "Don't worry about me, Hoss. When it's my time to go, it's my time."  On March 5, she called her mother from the motel and checked out at 12:30&nbsp;p.m., going the short distance to the airport and boarding a [[Piper PA-24 Comanche]] plane, [[aircraft registration|aircraft registration number]] N7000P. On board were Cline, Copas, Hawkins, and pilot Randy Hughes.

The plane stopped once in [[Rogers, Arkansas]], to refuel and subsequently landed at [[Dyersburg Regional Airport|Dyersburg Municipal Airport]] in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee]], at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=222–226}} Hawkins had accepted Billy Walker's place after Walker left on a commercial flight to take care of a stricken family member. The Dyersburg, Tennessee, airfield manager suggested they stay the night because of high winds and inclement weather, offering them free rooms and meals. But Hughes, who was not trained in instrument flying, said, "I've already come this far. We'll be there before you know it."

Early in the morning, [[Roger Miller]] and a friend went searching for survivors: "As fast as I could, I ran through the woods screaming their names—through the brush and the trees—and I came up over this little rise, oh, my God, there they were. It was ghastly. The plane had crashed nose down."<ref>Ellis Nassour's "Patsy Cline" and "Honky Tonk Angel" from exclusive 1979 and 1980 interviews with Miller</ref> Shortly after the bodies were removed, looters scavenged the area.

Cline's wristwatch, a [[Confederate flag]] cigarette lighter, a studded belt, and three pairs of gold lamé slippers were among them. Cline's fee in cash from the last performance was never recovered.<ref name=bard.org /> Per her wishes, Cline's body was brought home for her memorial service, which thousands attended.

In 1991, MCA records issued her first boxed set, titled ''The Patsy Cline Collection''. The album chronicled all of Cline's recorded material for Four Star and Decca Records. The boxed set received positive reviews, notably by Thom Jurek of ''[[Allmusic]]'', who rated it five out of five stars. Jurek commented, <blockquote>If an artist ever deserved a box set chronicling her entire career, it is Patsy Cline. Having recorded 102 sides between 1955 and her death at the age of 30 in 1963, Cline changed not only country music forever, but affected the world of pop as well. Over four CDs, arranged chronologically, the listener gets treated to a story in the development and maturation of a cultural icon who was at least, in terms of her gift, the equal of her legend.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jurek |first1=Thom |title='The Patsy Cline Collection': Patsy Cline: Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-patsy-cline-collection-mca-mw0000269114 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref></blockquote> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed the box set among their "Women Who Rock: 50 Greatest Albums of All-Time" list.

Cline has been portrayed on film and television several times since the 1980s. The [[Loretta Lynn]] biopic ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' (1980) renewed interest in her life and career.{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=247}} Cline and Lynn's friendship was portrayed in the 1980 film. Actress [[Beverly D'Angelo]] played Cline in the movie and did her own singing of Cline's original material. D'Angelo earned a [[Golden Globe]] award nomination for her role. In an interview D'Angelo did for a 2017 PBS documentary, playing the role of Patsy Cline "had a profound impact" on her life and career.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beverly D'Angelo to be honored at Las Cruces International Film Festival |url=https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/entertainment/2019/02/13/las-cruces-film-festival-beverly-dangelo-honor-national-lampoons-movie/2850788002/ |website=Las Cruces Sun News |access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name="10 Things"/>

In 1985, a feature film about Cline's life was released entitled ''[[Sweet Dreams (1985 film)|Sweet Dreams]]''.

Kurt Wolff wrote, "the soundtrack, however, featured overdubbed versions of Cline's material – better to stick with the originals."{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=303}} Mark Deming of ''[[Allmovie]]'' only gave the release two out of five stars. Deming commented, "While it's a wise approach to show how her turbulent marriage paralleled her crossover to Countrypolitan ballads, the melodrama tends to overshadow the celebrity story by relegating her rise to stardom to the background. Due to the historically dubious concerts at carnivals and fairgrounds, it appears as though she wasn't as big a star as she actually was." Deming did praise Lange's performance saying she created a "cheerful and spirited" depiction of Cline.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deming |first1=Mark |title='Sweet Dreams' (1985) – Karel Reiscz: Review |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/sweet-dreams-v48096/review |website=[[Allmovie]] |access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave it two stars in his original 1985 review.

===Plays and musicals===
Cline's life and career has also been re-created in the theater sector. In 1988, the show ''Always...Patsy Cline'' premiered. The show was created by Ted Swindley who derived it from a friendship Cline had with Texas resident Louise Seger. The pair met while Cline was performing at the [[Esquire Ballroom]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. Seger brought Cline home following the show and they spent the night together. The pair would remain in contact through letters before Cline's death. Much of the script relied from letters exchanged between the two during the course of several years. Seger acts as the show's narrator and revisits memories she shared with Cline through their letter exchanges.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cachuela |first1=Alicia |title=Always … Patsy Cline |date=July 13, 1997 |url=https://variety.com/1997/legit/reviews/always-patsy-cline-2-1117329653/ |access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> Among the show's original performers was [[Mandy Barnett]], who debuted the show at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in 1994.

===Voice and style===
Cline possessed a [[contralto]] voice. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine writer Richard Corliss called her voice "bold".<ref name="Time">{{cite magazine |last1=Corliss |first1=Richard |title=Music: Inclined to be Just Like Patsy |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985010,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002043/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985010,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> Her voice has also been praised for its display of emotion.

Cline was once quoted in describing the emotion she felt, saying, "Oh Lord, I sing just like I hurt inside."<ref name="Time"/>

During her early career, Cline recorded in styles such as [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rockabilly]], and [[honky-tonk]].{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}}{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=216}} These styles she cut for [[Four Star Records]] have been considered below the quality of her later work for [[Decca Records]].{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}} Steve Leggett of ''[[Allmusic]]'' commented, <blockquote>Her recordings prior to 1960, though, were something else again, and with the exception of 1956's "Walkin' After Midnight" and perhaps one or two other songs, she seemed reined in and stifled as a singer, even though she was working with the same producer, Owen Bradley, who was to produce her 1960s successes. Oh the difference a song makes, because in the end the material she recorded between 1955 and 1960 – all of which is collected on these two discs – was simply too weak for Cline to turn into anything resembling gold, even with her obvious vocal skills.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leggett |first1=Steve |title=''50 Golden Greats: The Complete Early Recordings'': Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/50-golden-greats-the-complete-early-years-mw0000506737 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref></blockquote>

Cline's style has been largely associated with the [[Nashville Sound]], a sub-genre of country music that linked traditional lyrics with orchestrated [[pop music]] styles.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Byworth |editor1-first=Tony |date= 2006|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Country Music |location= London|publisher=Flame Tree Publishing |pages=7, 115–117, 169 |isbn=978-1-84451-406-9}}</ref> This new sound helped many of her singles to [[crossover (music)|crossover]] onto the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and gain a larger audience that did not always listen to country music.{{sfn|Hofstra, Warren R.|2013|p=161}} Her producer [[Owen Bradley]] built this sound onto her Decca recordings, sensing a potential in her voice that went beyond traditional country music. At first, she resisted the pop-sounding style, but was ultimately convinced to record in this new style.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|pp=302–303}} Stephen M. Desuner of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' explained that Cline has been an identifiable factor with the Nashville Sound: "She essentially rewrote their songs simply by singing them, elevating their words and wringing every one of their rhymes for maximum dramatic potential."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deusner |first1=Stephen M. |title=Patsy Cline: ''Sentimentally Yours'': Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/patsy-cline-sentimentally-yours/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> Mark Deming of ''[[Allmusic]]'' commented, "Cline and Bradley didn't invent "countrypolitan," but precious few artists managed to meld the sophistication of pop and the emotional honesty of country as brilliantly as this music accomplishes with seemingly effortless grace, and these songs still sound fresh and brilliantly crafted decades after the fact."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deming |first1=Mark |title=''Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits'': Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/patsy-clines-greatest-hits-mw0002556625 |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref>

Cline's public image changed during the course of her career. She began her career wearing cowgirl dresses and hats designed by her mother. However, as her music crossed over into [[pop music|pop]], she began wearing sequined gowns and cocktail dresses.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=220}} While she would often wear cowgirl costumes for live performances, she would also wear evening dresses for television and metropolitan performances. For her 1957 performance on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'', the show's producer insisted that Cline wear an evening dress instead of the fringed cowgirl attire she had intended to wear.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jordan |first1=Larry |title=Renembering Patsy Cline|quote= Her last show was in Kansas City 35 years ago this Spring.

Cline has also been seen as a pioneer for women in country music.

Wolff explained, "She swaggered her way past stereotypes and other forces of resistance, showing the men in charge – and the public in general – that women were more than capable of singing about such hard subjects as divorce and drinking as well as love and understanding.{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|2000|p=302}} Sean O'Hagan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that along with [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Jean Shepard]] and [[Kitty Wells]], Cline helped prove that country music was not "macho" and that "strong women" could have a "strong voice".<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Hagan |first1=Sean |title=Honky-tonk women: the female artists who made it big in country music |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/06/honky-tonk-female-artists-country-music |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 6, 2012 |access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref> In 2013, Diane Reese wrote, "she was what I call a pre-feminist woman.

==Life and career==
Ray T. Peterson was born in [[Denton, Texas]] on April 23, 1935.<ref name="AMG"/> At the time of his death, sources gave 1939 as his year of birth.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/01/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Obituary: Ray Peterson|first=Dave|last=Laing|date=1 February 2005|access-date=4 December 2017|website=The Guardian}}</ref> As a boy he had [[poliomyelitis|polio]].<ref name="AMG"/> Having a four-[[octave]] singing [[human voice|voice]], Peterson moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he was signed to a [[recording contract]] with [[RCA Victor]] in 1958.<ref name="AMG"/> He [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] several songs that were minor [[hit record|hits]] until "[[The Wonder of You]]" made it into the [[Top 40]] of the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] on June 15, 1959. The song also did well in Australia, stopping at #9 on its chart.<ref name="AMG"/> The song would later be recorded by [[Elvis Presley]], with whom Peterson became friends. Peterson scored a [[Top 40|Top 10]] hit with the [[teenage tragedy song]], "[[Tell Laura I Love Her]]".<ref>#7 on June 27, 1960</ref> In the UK, [[Decca Records]] made the decision not to release the latter recording on the grounds that it was "too tasteless and vulgar," and destroyed about twenty thousand copies that had already been pressed. A cover version by [[Ricky Valance]], released by [[EMI]] on the [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, was Number One on the [[UK Singles Chart]] for three weeks.<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book

In 1960, Peterson created his own [[record label]] with his [[management|manager]] Stan Shulman, called Dunes Records, and enlisted the help of [[record producer]] [[Phil Spector]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/RayPeterson1.html|title=RAB Hall of Fame: Ray Peterson|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=4 December 2017|archive-date=15 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115174136/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/RayPeterson1.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> with "[[Corrine, Corrina]]".<ref name="Guardian"/><ref>#9 on December 19, 1960; produced by Spector; cover of a 1931 [[Red Nichols]] hit</ref> Peterson's dramatic [[ballad]], "I Could Have Loved You So Well", [[songwriter|written]] by [[Barry Mann]] and [[Gerry Goffin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mann-weil.com/music_discography.php?s=ghi#72|title=Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil - Official Website - Music - Discography|website=Mann-weil.com|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref> and produced by Spector,{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} only reached #57 on the U.S. chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Ray Peterson.

(The later song was covered by [[the Shangri-Las]] five years later and became a Top 30 hit.)

His last charting US-Top-30 hit was "[[Missing You (Red Sovine song)|Missing You]]".<ref>#29 on June 29, 1961</ref> By the mid-1960s he had become something of a phenomenon on the west coast of the United States, appearing live in numerous [[concert]]s with Keith Allison.

His performances at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium, produced by [[Fred Vail]], beginning in 1963 helped fuel a revival of "The Wonder of You", as well as launching his new relationship with [[MGM Records]], an alliance that produced two [[albums]]: ''The Very Best of Ray Peterson'' which featured most of the Dunes singles, and ''The Other Side of Ray Peterson,'' which included many of his [[nightclub]] songs. He later moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], and by the 1970s when the hit records stopped coming, Peterson became a [[Baptist Church]] [[religious minister|minister]] and occasionally played the classic hits music circuit. In 1981 he released a Christian folk rock album called ''Highest Flight'', which was also released as ''My Father's Place''.

Peterson was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Peterson died of colon cancer on January 25, 2005, in [[Smyrna, Tennessee]], aged 69.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p11407/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Jason Ankeny |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 29, 2009}}</ref> He left a [[widow]], four sons, and three daughters.<ref name="Guardian"/> For publicity reasons, he had shaved four years off his age, leading many sources to list his age as 65. He was interred in the Roselawn Memorial Gardens cemetery in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].

'''Clyde Julian''' "'''Red'''" '''Foley''' (June 17, 1910 – September 19, 1968)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=140/2}}</ref> was an American musician who made a major contribution to the growth of [[country music]] after World War II.

For more than two decades, Foley was one of the biggest stars of the genre, selling more than 25 million records. His 1951 hit, "[[Peace in the Valley]]", was among the first million-selling [[gospel music|gospel]] records. A [[Grand Ole Opry]] veteran until his death, Foley also hosted the first popular country music series on network television, ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', from 1955 to 1960.

He is a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], which called him "one of the most versatile and moving performers of all time" and "a giant influence during the formative years of contemporary Country music."

==Biography==
Foley was born on a {{convert|24|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm in [[Blue Lick, Kentucky]],<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> and grew up nearby [[Berea, Kentucky|Berea]]. He gained the nickname Red for his hair color. He was born into a musical family, and by the time he was nine was giving impromptu concerts at his father's general store, playing French harp, piano, banjo, trombone, harmonica and guitar. At 17, he won first prize in a statewide talent show. He graduated from Berea High School, and later worked as a $2-a-show usher and singer at a theater in [[Covington, Kentucky]]. Foley was of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishamerica.com/2012/01/roots-the-foley-family/|title=Roots: The Foley Family |website=Irishamerica.com|date=January 26, 2012 |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref>

===Early radio and recording career===
In 1930, as a freshman at [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]], Foley was chosen by a talent scout from Chicago's [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]] to sing with producer John Lair's Cumberland Ridge Runners, the house band on ''[[National Barn Dance]]''. His first single, "Life is Good Enough for Me / The Lone Cowboy", was released in June 1933 on the [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]] label. In 1937 he returned to Kentucky with Lair to help establish the ''[[Renfro Valley Barn Dance]]'' stage and radio show near [[Mt. Vernon, Kentucky|Mt. Vernon]] in 1939, performing everything from ballads to [[boogie-woogie]] to [[blues]]. In late 1939, Foley became the first country artist to host a network radio program, [[NBC Red Network|NBC]]'s ''Avalon Time'' (co-hosted by [[Red Skelton]]), and he performed extensively at theaters, clubs and fairs. He then returned for another seven-year stint with ''National Barn Dance''.

In 1941, the same year he made his first of only two [[Cinema of the United States|film]] appearances (portraying himself) with [[Tex Ritter]] in the [[western (genre)|Western]], ''The Pioneers'', Foley signed a lifetime contract with [[Decca Records]]. He also released "[[Old Shep (song)|Old Shep]]" in 1941, a song he wrote with Arthur Willis in 1933 about a dog he owned as a boy (in reality, his [[German shepherd]], poisoned by a neighbor, was named Hoover). The song, later recorded by many artists including [[Hank Snow]] and [[Elvis Presley]], became a country classic.<ref name="Red Foley Fans Tribute">{{cite web|url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=416559146|title=Red Foley Fans Tribute|website=Myspace.com|access-date=2009-03-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115031809/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile|archive-date=January 15, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His patriotic 1944 single, "[[Smoke On The Water (Red Foley song)|Smoke on the Water]]", topped the folk records chart for 13 consecutive weeks, and on January 17, 1945, Foley was the first country performer to record in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During the session at [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]]'s Studio B, he recorded "[[Tennessee Saturday Night]]", "Blues in My Heart" and "Tennessee Border". He soon became known for such songs as "The Death of Floyd Collins" and "The Sinking of the Titanic".<ref>The Associated Press (September 21, 1968) "Red Foley Dead; Country Singer", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. 33</ref> He moved to Nashville in 1946 and was briefly a member of the Brown's Ferry Four, recording "Jesus Hold My Hand" and "I'll Meet You in the Morning".

===Mr. Country Music===
In April 1946, Foley signed on to emcee and perform on ''The Prince Albert Show'', the segment of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' carried on [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]]. During the next eight years he established himself as one of the most respected and versatile performers in country music. He acted as master of ceremonies, the straight man for Opry comedians [[Rod Brasfield]] and [[Minnie Pearl]], and proved himself a vocalist who could handle all types of material.<ref name="Red Foley Fans Tribute"/> His popularity was credited with establishing the Opry as America's top country music radio show. In 1949, Foley was part of the Opry's first European tour, visiting U.S. military bases in England, West Germany and the Azores, with Brasfield, [[Roy Acuff]], Minnie Pearl, [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Hank Williams]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Opry|work=Grand Ole Opry|publisher=Gaylord Entertainment|url=http://opry.com/about/index.html|access-date=2010-01-26|archive-date=July 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727231806/http://www.opry.com/about/index.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Foley began recording with his backing group, the Cumberland Valley Boys, in 1947. He recorded seven top five hits with the group between 1947 and 1949, including a No.&nbsp;1 single, "[[New Jolie Blonde (New Pretty Blonde)]]" (a cover of a 1946 [[Moon Mullican]] hit), and the country boogie anthem "[[Tennessee Saturday Night]]", a chart-topper in 1948. In 1950, he had three million-sellers: "[[Just a Closer Walk with Thee (song)|Just a Closer Walk with Thee]]", "[[Steal Away]]" (recorded by Hank Williams as "The Funeral"), and a solo version of the song that became his trademark, "[[Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy]]".<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> Featuring guitarist [[Grady Martin]], it stayed at No.&nbsp;1 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]] for 13 weeks and hit the pop chart as well.

In April 1951, Foley was pleased when the popular [[Andrews Sisters]] (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) flew from Hollywood to Nashville to join him for a two-day recording session, both acts hoping to repeat the previous successes that the sisters enjoyed when they teamed with [[Burl Ives]] in 1947 and [[Ernest Tubb]] in 1949, producing both folk and country hits. While the results proved to be less popular, the ten tunes recorded were vocally well-executed and received a good deal of play on the country radio stations. The songs included the rhythmic "Satins and Lace", the rockabilly-flavored novelty "Where Is Your Wandering Mother Tonight?", a very slow rendering of the forlorn hillbilly classic "[[Bury Me Beneath the Willow]]", two duets by Foley and Patty Andrews, and two country gospel favorites: "[[It Is No Secret (What God Can Do)]]" and "He Bought My Soul at Calvary".<ref>Sforza, John: "Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages</ref>

In 1951, Foley's second wife, Judy Martin, took her own life. To devote more time to his family in Nashville, he cut back on performing but continued to release hits in a variety of styles, including [[rockabilly]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. His 1951 hit, [[Peace in the Valley|"(There'll Be) Peace in the Valley (for Me)"]] backed by the Sunshine Boys quartet, was one of the first [[gospel music]] records to sell one million copies. He also released his first LP that year, ''Souvenir Album'' (Decca DL-5303).

Foley's manager was Jim McConnell and "Dub" Albritton was his personal appearances manager. Starting in 1951, he hosted ''The Red Foley Show'' on Saturday afternoons on [[NBC#Defining radio's golden age|NBC Radio]] from Nashville (moving to [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] and [[Springfield, Missouri]] from 1956 to 1961) sponsored by [[Dow Chemical]]. On November 21, 1953, he was one of the first eight singers named to ''Billboard'' magazine's Honor Roll of Country and Western artists, "named by the disk jockeys of America as an all-time great of country & western music."<ref>"Honor Roll of C&W Artists" (December 5, 1953) ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]'', p. 48</ref>

Foley never lost his love for country music and, unlike [[Eddy Arnold]], never sought success as a pop artist, even though many of his recordings made the pop charts.<ref name="Red Foley Fans Tribute"/> Other hits included "[[Sugarfoot Rag]]", "Cincinnati Dancing Pig" and "[[Birmingham Bounce]]", which stayed at No.&nbsp;1 for 14 weeks. Foley's success with the song prompted 21 cover versions. "One By One", a duet with [[Kitty Wells]], hit No.&nbsp;1 in 1954 and stayed on the charts for 41 weeks. He also recorded with [[Ernest Tubb]] (with whom he maintained a fictitious on-air "feud"), the Dixie Dons, the [[Anita Kerr Singers]], [[Rosetta Tharpe]], Evelyn Knight and the [[Lawrence Welk]] Orchestra. Known by then as Mr. Country Music and America's Favorite Country Gentleman, critics dubbed him the "barnyard [[Bing Crosby]]".<ref>Dessauer, Phil "Springfield, Mo.-Radio City of Country Music" (April 1957), ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'', p. 154</ref>

===Television career===
[[File:Red Foley.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Foley c. 1956]]After several years in virtual retirement, Foley moved to Springfield, Missouri in July 1954 after music executive [[Si Siman]] convinced him to host ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] and [[Citadel Media|radio]]. The deal was made over a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] whiskey at the Andrew Jackson Hotel in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref>Sylvester, Ron "100 Ozarkers: 'Si' Siman Impacted Country Music" (October 10, 1999), "Progress," ''Springfield News-Leader'', p.&nbsp;8H</ref> Foley struggled with alcohol,<ref>{{Cite book|first=Rita|last=Spears-Stewart|title=Remembering the Ozark Jubilee|publisher=Stewart, Dillbeck & White Productions|year=1993|isbn=0-9638648-0-7}}, p. 13</ref> which according to [[Maxine Brown (country singer)|Maxine Brown]], "was a well-kept secret among all the entertainers because we loved him so much."<ref>{{cite book| author=Brown, Maxine| year = 2005| title=Looking Back to See: A Country Music Memoir| publisher=University of Arkansas Press| location=Fayetteville| isbn =1-55728-790-2}}</ref>

In 1955, an official act of the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] honored him as the artist who has "contributed with humility and reverence more than any other person to perpetuate the music so deeply embedded in the hearts of the American people."<ref>Sachs, Bill (May 21, 1955) ''The Billboard'', p. 37</ref> That same year, he was credited with discovering 11-year-old [[Brenda Lee]], who became a ''Jubilee'' regular. On the October 4, 1956 program, Decca executives presented him with a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] for "Peace in the Valley".<ref>Sachs, Bill "Folk Talent & Tunes" (September 22, 1956) ''The Billboard'', p. 71.</ref> The ''Jubilee'' ran for nearly six years and further cemented Foley's fame, but was canceled partly because of [[Income tax (U.S.)|federal income tax]] [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|evasion charges]] pending against him in 1960. His first trial that fall ended with a hung jury, but on April 23, 1961, he was quickly acquitted.<ref>"Foley Acquitted of Tax Evasion" (April 23, 1961), ''[[Springfield News-Leader|Springfield Leader & Press]]'', p. A1</ref>

From 1954 to 1955, Foley recorded a number of [[Acetate discs|transcriptions]] for [[Ralph D. Foster|RadiOzark Enterprises]] in Springfield with his band of [[Tommy Jackson (musician)|Tommy Jackson]] on fiddle, Grady Martin on guitar, steel guitarist [[Bud Isaacs]], guitarist [[Jimmie Selph]], [[Bob Moore (musician)|Bob Moore]] on bass and Billy Burke on accordion.

On April 25, 1956, he appeared on ABC's ''[[Masquerade Party]]'' as Little Red Riding Hood, and made a guest appearance the next day on CBS' ''[[Strike It Rich (radio-TV)|Strike it Rich]]''.<ref>Sachs, Bill "Folk Talent & Tunes" (April 28, 1956) ''The Billboard'', p. 58.</ref> He appeared on ABC's ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'', a 1957–1960 program hosted by his son-in-law [[Pat Boone]]. On February 22, 1960, he appeared on ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]''.<ref>"Talent on the Road" (February 22, 1960), ''The Billboard'', p. 53.</ref> In the summer of 1961, Foley appeared twice on NBC-TV's ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]'' and made 58 appearances at 22 state fairs with [[Uncle Cyp and Aunt Sap Brasfield|Boob Brasfield]].<ref>"Red Foley Set on 58 Fair Dates" (July 3, 1961), ''Billboard'', p. 9</ref> He moved to Los Angeles, and from 1962 to 1963 played [[Fess Parker]]'s Uncle Cooter on ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (TV series)|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', an ABC-TV sitcom. In 1963, he returned to Nashville and performed and toured with the Grand Ole Opry. He appeared in the 1966 film musical, ''Sing a Song, for Heaven's Sake'', and was a guest on ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'' on August 24, 1967.

Foley was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1967 (the first Kentuckian and one of only six then-living inductees), which honored him as "one of the most versatile and moving performers of all time" and "a giant influence during the formative years of contemporary Country music and today a timeless legend."

===Death===
On September 19, 1968, Foley appeared in two Opry performances in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], sponsored by the local Sheriff's Posse<ref>"Red Foley, a Country Great, is Found Dead" September 1968 ''Billboard''</ref> that included [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] and 19-year-old [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], son of his long-time friend [[Hank Williams]]. Williams Jr. noted that Foley was somewhat slower than usual that day and had no appetite. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in [[Jesus|Christ]]: Foley said, "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I looked him in the face and said, "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." I prayed with Red. He went out, and the last song he sang was "Peace in the Valley". He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billywalker.com|title=In Memory of Billy Walker|publisher=The estate of Billy Walker|access-date=2009-04-17}}</ref> Foley suffered [[acute pulmonary edema|respiratory failure]] that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as [[Luke the Drifter#Luke the Drifter|Luke the Drifter]], Jr.) "I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away").<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> According to the song, which charted that November, his [[last words]] were, "I'm awful tired now, Hank. I've got to go to bed."<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Foley had sung "Peace in the Valley" at Hank Sr.'s funeral. Foley was interred in [[Woodlawn Memorial Park (Nashville, Tennessee)|Woodlawn Memorial Park]] in Nashville.

==Family==
Foley had an older brother, Clarence "Cotton" Foley (1903–1988), who in 1939, along with brother Red, John Lair, and [[The Duke of Paducah|Whitey Ford]], co-founded the [[Renfro Valley Barn Dance]] in Rockcastle County, Kentucky.

Foley's first wife was Axie Pauline Cox, who died giving birth to their daughter Betty. Betty (1933–1990) married Bentley Cummins in 1948 and had three children. On August 9, 1933, Foley married his second wife, Eva Alaine Overstake. Known during her solo career as [[Judy Martin (singer)|Judy Martin]], she was one of the Three Little Maids on ''National Barn Dance'' and a sister of country music songwriter [[Jenny Lou Carson]]. Red and Eva had three daughters.

On November 17, 1951, Eva Foley died by suicide.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogers & Langley |title=The Life and Times of Jenny Lou Carson |date=2005 |publisher=Nova/Nashville Books |isbn=0-9628452-4-8 |page=236}}</ref>

On December 17, 1952, Foley announced in Nashville that he had secretly married his third wife, radio and TV entertainer Sally Sweet, on October 28 in [[Iuka, Mississippi]].<ref>AP Wirephoto pc406124tsn caption "Secretly Married", (December 17, 1952)</ref> Earlier that year, he had settled out of court with Sweet's former husband, Nashville music publisher Frank B. Kelton, who had sued him in April for $100,000 for alienation of affection.<ref>"'Red' Foley Weds" (December 17, 1952) Danville, Va. ''Bee'', p. B9</ref>

Shirley Lee Foley married actor-singer [[Pat Boone]] in 1953. Their daughters include [[Cherry Boone]] and [[Debby Boone]].

==Legacy==
Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll, in particular [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]], who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.

Foley has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one for his recording career at, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10, 2003, a Kentucky State [[historical marker]] (No.&nbsp;2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.

In 2002, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame, where his corncob pipe is on display. In [[List of recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry#2006|2006]], his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Recording Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/about-this-program/|title=About This Program &#124; National Recording Preservation Board &#124; Programs at the Library of Congress|website=Loc.gov|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>

In 1970, [[Berea College]] established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley's career, such as [[folk music|folk]], country, [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], gospel and popular music.

A dance to Foley's recording of "Papa" John Gordy's song, The [[Salty Dog Rag]], has been [[Dartmouth College traditions|traditional at Dartmouth College]] since 1972, where it is taught to freshmen during orientation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://2010.dartmouth.edu/beinga10/traditions/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709020452/http://2010.dartmouth.edu/beinga10/traditions/|url-status=dead|title=Traditions|archive-date=July 9, 2012|access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCrIKSIvTKI |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/tCrIKSIvTKI |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=Dartmouth–The Salty Dog Rag|date=October 11, 2008 |publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=January 25, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at [[Calvin College]] has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say, "Red Foley was a great country music singer, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://calvin.edu/directory/places/rooks-van-dellen-hall|title=Rooks-Van Dellen Hall|website=Calvin.edu|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=144816492212385&v=info |title=Facebook |website=Facebook.com |access-date=2013-07-02}}</ref>

Foley Middle School, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.

Red Foley Court is among several streets in [[Nixa, Missouri]], named for performers on ''Ozark Jubilee'', and Red Foley Road is in [[Rockcastle County, Kentucky]], north of Renfro Valley.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://maps.google.com/ | title = Google Maps | publisher = Google Maps | access-date = 2009-10-20}}</ref>

In 2009, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin), entitled {{YouTube|TLC6yUMidf4|"A Cowgirl's Suicide"}}.<ref>{{YouTube|TLC6yUMidf4|A Cowgirl's Suicide}} dedicated to Red Foley's wife Eva Overstake.</ref> The song was featured in the independent film ''Laid Off'' by director John Launchi.

'''Eric Hilliard Nelson''' (May 8, 1940 – December 31, 1985) was an American musician and actor. From age eight he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist. 

His fame as both a recording artist and television star also led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in [[Howard Hawks]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] feature film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). He placed 54 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and its predecessors between 1957 and 1973, including "[[Poor Little Fool]]" in 1958, which was the first number one song on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's then-newly created [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 chart]]. He recorded 17 additional top ten hits and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on January 21, 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|1983|p=491}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=284}} In 1996 Nelson was ranked No. 49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref name="fifty" />

Nelson began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet''. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]''. In 1957, he recorded his first single ("I'm Walkin' b/w "A Teenager's Romance", Verve 10047X4S), debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album ''[[Ricky (album)|Ricky]]''. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, "[[Poor Little Fool]]", and in 1959 received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for "Most Promising Male Newcomer" after starring in ''Rio Bravo''. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs. In his twenties, he moved away from the pop music of his youth and began to perform in a [[country rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |title=Rick Nelson Biography |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2022-11-23 |archive-date=November 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124044719/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |url-status=live }}</ref> After recording several albums with mostly [[session musician]]s, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album ''[[In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969]]'' and had a surprise hit with 1972's "[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label. He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade. He released two more albums, with unimpressive results, before [[Death of Ricky Nelson|his death in a plane crash]] on New Year's Eve, 1985.

Nelson was married once, to [[Kristin Nelson|Sharon Kristin Harmon]], from 1963 until their divorce in 1982. They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]], twin sons and musicians [[Gunnar Nelson (musician)|Gunnar]] and [[Matthew Nelson (musician)|Matthew]], and actor Sam.

==Early life==
Nelson was born on May 8, 1940, in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=2, 16–17}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=25}}<ref name="NOTE" /> He was the second son of entertainment couple [[Ozzie Nelson|Ozzie]] and [[Harriet Nelson]]. His father was of half Swedish descent. The Nelsons' older son was actor [[David Nelson (actor)|David Nelson]].

Harriet, normally the vocalist for Ozzie's band, remained in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], with her newborn and toddler. Meanwhile, bandleader Ozzie toured with the Nelson orchestra.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=17}} The Nelsons bought a two-story colonial house in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]],{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=17}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=26}}<ref name="Cotten" /> and six months after the purchase, moved with son David to Hollywood, where Ozzie and Harriet were slated to appear in the 1941–42 season of [[Red Skelton]]'s ''The Raleigh Cigarette Hour;'' Ricky remained in Tenafly in the care of his paternal grandmother.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=18}} In November 1941, the Nelsons bought what would become their permanent home: a green and white, two-story, Cape Cod colonial home at 1822&nbsp;Camino Palmero in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=19}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=26}} Ricky joined his parents and brother there in 1942.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=19}}

Ricky was a small and insecure child who suffered from severe [[asthma]]. At night, his sleep was eased with a vaporizer emitting tincture of evergreen.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=19–20}} He was described by Red Skelton's producer [[John Guedel]] as "an odd little kid", likable, shy, introspective, mysterious, and inscrutable.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=20}} When Skelton was drafted in 1944, Guedel crafted the radio sitcom ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' for Ricky's parents.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=20}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=29}} The show debuted on Sunday, October 8, 1944, to favorable reviews.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=21}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=30}} Ozzie eventually became head writer for the show and based episodes on the fraternal exploits and enmity of his sons.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=22}} The Nelson boys were first played in the radio series by professional child actors until twelve-year-old Dave and eight-year-old Ricky joined the show on February 20, 1949, in the episode "Invitation to Dinner".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=24–25}}{{sfn|Dennis|2013|p=15}}

[[File:Adv of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson Family 1952.jpg|thumb|The Nelson family, 1952]]
In 1952, the Nelsons tested the waters for a television series with the theatrically released film ''Here Come the Nelsons.'' The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio's airwaves to television's small screen. On October 3, 1952, ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history.

==Education==
Nelson attended Gardner Street Public School,{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=23}} Bancroft Junior High,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=47}} and, between 1954 and 1958, [[Hollywood High School]], from which he graduated with a B average.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} He played [[American football|football]] at Hollywood High{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} and represented the school in interscholastic [[tennis]] matches.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=55}} Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' he hated school because it "smelled of pencils" and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}} In January 1960 the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1/27/1960 episode of "Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" titled 'THE CIRCUS'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/579275570816609584/|title=RICKY NELSON on the TRAPEZE!

Ozzie Nelson was a [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] alumnus and keen on college education,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=15}} but eighteen-year-old Ricky was already in the 93&nbsp;percent income-tax bracket and saw no reason to attend.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} At age thirteen, Ricky was making over $100,000 per annum, and at sixteen he had a personal fortune of $500,000{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=53}} ({{Inflation|US|500000|1956|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).

Nelson's wealth was astutely managed by his parents, who channeled his earnings into trust funds. Although his parents permitted him a $50 allowance at the age of eighteen, Ricky was often strapped for cash and one evening collected and redeemed empty pop bottles to gain entrance to a movie theater for himself and a date.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=54–55}}

==Music career==

===Debut===
Nelson played clarinet and drums in his [[tween (demographic)|tweens]] and early teens, learned the rudimentary guitar chords, and vocally imitated his favorite [[Sun Records]] [[rockabilly]] artists in the bathroom at home or in the showers at the [[Los Angeles Tennis Club]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}} He was strongly influenced by the music of [[Carl Perkins]] and once said he tried to emulate the sound and the tone of the guitar break in Perkins's March 1956 [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]".{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}}

At age sixteen, he wanted to impress his girlfriend of two years, Diana Osborn(e), who was an [[Elvis]] fan and, although he had no record contract at the time, told her that he, too, was going to make a record.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=60}}{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}} With his father's help, he secured a one-record deal with [[Verve Records]], an important jazz label looking for a young and popular personality who could sing or be taught to sing.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=69}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}} On March 26, 1957, he recorded the [[Fats Domino]] standard "[[I'm Walkin']]" and "[[A Teenager's Romance]]" (released in late April 1957 as his first single),<ref name="pc11" /> and "[[You're My One and Only Love]]".{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=71}}

Before the single was released, he made his television rock-and-roll debut on April 10, 1957, singing and playing the drums to "I'm Walkin'" in the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' episode "Ricky, the Drummer".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=72}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=66}} About the same time, he made an unpaid public appearance, singing "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" with [[The Four Preps]] at a Hamilton High School lunch-hour assembly<ref name="pc11" /> in Los Angeles and was greeted by hordes of screaming teens who had seen the television episode.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=75}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}}

"[[I'm Walkin']]" reached No. 4 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Best Sellers in Stores chart, and its flip side, "[[A Teenager's Romance]]", hit #2.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}} When the television series went on summer break in 1957, Nelson made his first road trip and played four state and county fairs in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] with the Four Preps, who opened and closed for him.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=70}}

===First album, band, and #1 single===
In early summer 1957, Ozzie Nelson pulled his son from Verve after disputes about royalties and signed him to a lucrative five-year deal with [[Imperial Records]] that gave him approval over song selection, sleeve artwork, and other production details.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=78–79}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=73–74}} Ricky's first Imperial single, "[[Be-Bop Baby]]", generated 750,000 advance orders, sold over one million copies, and reached No. 3 on the charts. Nelson's first album, ''Ricky'', was released in October 1957 and hit #1 before the end of the year.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=76}} Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=80}}

Nelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=81}} Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist [[James Burton]] was the first signed. Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=83}} Their first recording together was "[[Believe What You Say]]". Prior to this, [[Joe Maphis]] had been playing the lead guitar part, and played lead on his first hits "Be-Bop Baby", "Stood Up", and "Waitin In School".

In 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old [[Sharon Sheeley]]'s "[[Poor Little Fool]]" for his second album, ''Ricky Nelson'', released in June 1958.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=89}} Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=89–90}} On August 4, 1958, "Poor Little Fool" became the #1 single on ''Billboard'''s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=91}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=90}} and sold over two million copies.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}

Nelson stated:
{{blockquote|Anyone who knocks rock 'n' roll either doesn't understand it, or is prejudiced against it, or is just plain square. – ''[[NME]]'' – November 1958<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3" />}}

[[File:Ricky Nelson - publicity.JPG|thumb|Nelson publicity photo, 1960]]
During 1958 and 1959, Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] eleven. During these two years, Presley had recorded music only for the movie ''[[King Creole]]'', in January and February 1958, before his induction into the U.S. Armed Forces and a brief recording session (consisting of five songs) while on [[Leave (military)|military leave]] four months later. In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly. By 1960, the Ricky Nelson International Fan Club had 9,000 chapters around the world.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=92–93}}

Nelson was the first teen idol to use television to promote hit records. Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for "Travelin' Man". Nelson appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He starred in the episode "A Hand For Sonny Blue" from the 1977 series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the United Kingdom as ''Twist in the Tale''). In 1979, he guest-hosted on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', spoofing his television sitcom image by appearing in a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' sendup in which, always trying to go "home," he finds himself among the characters from other 1950s/early 1960s-era sitcoms, ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'', and ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Nelson knew and loved music and was a skilled performer even before he became a [[teen idol]], largely because of his parents' musical background. Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including [[James Burton]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Allen "Puddler" Harris]], all natives of [[Louisiana]], and [[Joe Maphis]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Johnny Burnette|Johnny]] and [[Dorsey Burnette]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Nelson's music was very well recorded with a clear, punchy sound—thanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskell.<ref name="Tech" />

From 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and [[Pat Boone]] (38). Many of Nelson's early records were double hits with both the A and B sides hitting the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

While Nelson preferred [[rockabilly]] and [[uptempo]] rock [[songs]] like "[[Believe What You Say]]" (Hot 100 #4), "[[I Got a Feeling (Ricky Nelson song)|I Got a Feeling]]" (#10), "[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]" (#12), "[[Hello Mary Lou]]" (#9), "It's Late" (#9), "[[Stood Up (song)|Stood Up]]" (#2), "[[Waitin' In School (song)|Waitin' in School]]" (#18), "[[Be-Bop Baby]]" (#3), and "[[Just a Little Too Much]]" (#9), his smooth, calm voice made him a natural to sing ballads.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He had major success with "[[Travelin' Man]]" (#1), "[[A Teenager's Romance]]" (#2), "Poor Little Fool" (#1), "[[Young World (song)|Young World]]" (#5), "[[Lonesome Town]]" (#7), "[[Never Be Anyone Else But You]]" (#6), "[[Sweeter Than You]]" (#9), "[[It's Up to You (Ricky Nelson song)|It's Up to You]]" (#6), and "[[Teen Age Idol]]" (#5), which clearly could have been about Nelson himself.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

==Film actor==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}
[[File:Howard Hawks'Rio Bravo trailer (33-2).jpg|thumb|upright|Nelson in ''Rio Bravo'', 1959]]
[[File:John Wayne and Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson in 'Rio Bravo', 1959.jpg|thumb|right|upright]]
In addition to his recording career, Nelson appeared in movies. He made his film debut in ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]'' (1952) and had a small role in ''[[The Story of Three Loves]]'' (1953) at MGM directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] playing [[Farley Granger]] as a boy.

Following his success on TV and with singing, [[Howard Hawks]] cast him as a gunslinger in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]]; Hawks attributed much of the film's box office success to Nelson.

Nelson co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'' (1960), which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series (in which Nelson did not appear). He guest starred on ''[[General Electric Theatre]]'' ("The Wish Book") and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father, ''[[Love and Kisses (1965 movie)|Love and Kisses]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]].

Nelson guest starred on ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]'' (playing [[Jesse James]]), and had a support role in ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'' (1969) with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]].

Nelson was in ''[[Fol-de-Rol]]'' (1972), guest starred on ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|A Twist in the Tale]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. On ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' he played the part of "Tony Eagle" and performed various well-known Nelson songs throughout the episode.

He had support roles in the TV films ''[[Three on a Date]]'' and ''[[High School USA]]'' (1983).

==Name change and 1960s career==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}
On May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from "Ricky Nelson" to "Rick Nelson". His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on "Ozzie and Harriet". Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting [[Carl Perkins]], Perkins noted that he and "Ricky" were the last of the "rockabilly breed".

In 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with [[Decca Records]]. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964's "For You" (#6), Nelson's chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of [[Beatlemania]], [[The British Invasion]], and later the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture era]]. However, instead of dropping him, Decca kept him on board.

In the mid-1960s, Nelson began to move toward [[country music]], becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called "[[California Sound]]" (which would include singers like [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] and bands such as [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the [[Top 40]] again until 1970, when he recorded [[Bob Dylan]]'s "She Belongs to Me" with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring [[Randy Meisner]], who in 1971 became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and former [[The Buckaroos|Buckaroo]] steel guitarist [[Tom Brumley]].

=="Garden Party" and short-lived comeback==
[[File:Rick Nelson performing 1970.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson performing on ''The Jim Nabors Show'' in 1970]]
In 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with "[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]," a song he wrote in disgust after a [[Richard Nader]] [[Oldies]] Concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] where the audience booed, perhaps against some unrelated police action. However, Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits.<ref name="straightdope1" /> When he performed [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[Honky Tonk Women]]," there was booing, said to be against police and not him.<ref name="straightdope1" /> He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his "oldies." He returned to the stage and played his "oldies" and the audience responded with applause, according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire ''Garden Party'' album yet. "Garden Party" reached No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart]] and was certified as a [[RIAA certification|gold single]]. The second single released from the album was "Palace Guard" which peaked at #65.

In 1973, [[MCA Records]], whose parent company [[MCA Inc.]] had owned American Decca since 1962, ceased the label's operations, and transferred Nelson (and many other Decca artists) to its roster. His comeback was short-lived, and Nelson's band soon resigned. MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. A new band was formed by [[Lindy Goetz]], then a promotion person at MCA Records.<ref name="GoodReads" /> Nelson's band moved to Aspen and changed their name to "Canyon." Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the ''[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]'' album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of ''Garden Party.''

In 1974, MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like ''[[Windfall (Rick Nelson album)|Windfall]]'' failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like [[Knott's Berry Farm]] and [[Disneyland]]. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.

Nelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like "Rock and Roll Lady." With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.

==Personal life==
[[File:Rick kris nelson 1964.JPG|thumb|Ricky and Kristin Nelson in 1964]]

In 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with [[Marianne Gaba]], who played the role of Ricky's girlfriend in three episodes of ''Ozzie and Harriet''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=136}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=72}} Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship, although according to Gaba "we used to [[Making out|neck]] ''for hours''."{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=73}}

The next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old [[Lorrie Collins]], a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called ''Town Hall Party''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=106}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=81}} The two wrote Nelson's first composition, the song "My Gal", and she introduced him to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Tex Ritter]]. Collins appeared in an ''Ozzie and Harriet'' episode as Ricky's girlfriend and sang "Just Because" with him in the musical finale.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=83}} They went steady and discussed marriage, but their parents discouraged the idea.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=83, 116}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=138, 145}}

===Kris Harmon===
At Christmas 1961, Nelson began dating [[Kristin Nelson|Kristin Harmon]] (June 25, 1945 – April 26, 2018), a daughter of football player [[Tom Harmon]] and actress [[Elyse Knox]] (née Elsie Kornbrath) and the older sister of [[Kelly Harmon|Kelly]] and [[Mark Harmon]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=138, 140–141}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=140}} The Nelsons and the Harmons had long been friends, and a union between their children held great appeal.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=139}} Rick and Kris had much in common: quiet dispositions, Hollywood upbringings, and high-powered, domineering fathers.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=140}}

They married on April 20, 1963. Kris was pregnant,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=149}} and Rick later described the union as a "[[shotgun wedding]]".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=144}} Nelson, a nonpracticing Protestant, received instruction in Catholicism at the insistence of the bride's parents{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=144}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=137, 149}} and signed a pledge to have any children of the union raised in the Catholic faith.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=149}} Kris Nelson joined the television show as a regular cast member in 1963.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=145}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=150}} They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Kristine Nelson]], twin sons Gunnar Eric Nelson and Matthew Gray Nelson who formed the band [[Nelson (band)|Nelson]], and Sam Hilliard Nelson.

By 1975, following the birth of their last child, the marriage had deteriorated and a very public, controversial divorce involving both families was covered in the press for several years. In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=230}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=205}} Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris's extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=251}} The impasse over Rick's career created unpleasantness at home. Kris became an alcoholic and left the children in the care of household help.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=218}} After years of legal proceedings, they were divorced in December 1982. The divorce was financially devastating for Nelson, with attorneys and accountants taking over $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=221}} Years of legal wrangling followed.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=237}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=262}}

In 1980, Nelson met Helen Blair, a part-time model and exotic-animal trainer, in [[Las Vegas]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=242}} Within months of their meeting, she became his road companion, and in 1982 she began living with him.

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Ricky Nelson}}

On December 31, 1985, Nelson died when the [[Douglas DC-3]] on which he was a passenger crashed into trees, poles, and electrical wires, when it attempted to make an emergency landing while in flight between [[Guntersville, Alabama]], and [[Dallas]], Texas, where he was to perform a [[New Year's Eve]] concert.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=261–262}} Nelson's DC-3 seemed constantly beset by mechanical problems.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=259}} The fatal fire was caused by a defective heater in the tail of the plane. The heater caught fire and filled the cabin with toxic fumes. While both pilots survived, all seven passengers died.<ref name="NTSB" />

'''Roy Linwood Clark''' (April 15, 1933&nbsp;– November 15, 2018) was an American singer, musician, and television presenter. He is best known for having hosted ''[[Hee Haw]]'', a nationally televised country variety show, from 1969 to 1997. Clark was an important and influential figure in [[country music]], both as a performer and in helping to popularize the genre.

During the 1970s, Clark frequently guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and enjoyed a 30-million viewership for ''Hee Haw''. Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, [[banjo]] player, and [[fiddle]]r.  He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including classical guitar, country music, [[Latin music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and pop.  He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., "[[Hier encore|Yesterday, When I Was Young]]" and "Thank God and Greyhound"), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and country musicians. He became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1987, and, in 2009, was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]]. He published his autobiography, ''My Life—in Spite of Myself'', in 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-86434-7 |title=Nonfiction Book Review: 'My Life in Spite of Myself' |date=February 28, 1994 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
Clark was born April 15, 1933, in [[Meherrin, Virginia]],{{sfn|''Current Biography Yearbook''|1979|page=83}} one of five children<ref name=Thanki>{{cite news| url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/15/roy-clark-dead-85/1978910002/| title=Roy Clark, 'Hee Haw' co-host, Country Music Hall of Fame member, dies at 85| last=Thanki| first=Juli| newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]| location=Nashville| access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> born to Hester Linwood Clark and Lillian Clark (Oliver).{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} His father was a tobacco farmer.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} He spent his childhood in Meherrin and New York City, where his father moved the family to take jobs during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} When Clark was 11 years old, his family moved to a home on 1st Street SE in the [[Washington Highlands, Washington, D.C.|Washington Highlands]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.,{{sfn|Clark|Eliot|1994|page=84}} after his father found work at the [[Washington Navy Yard]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}}

Clark's father was a semi-professional musician who played [[banjo]], [[violin|fiddle]], and guitar,{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} and his mother played piano.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} The first musical instrument Clark ever played was a four-string cigar box with a ukulele neck attached to it,{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} which he picked up in elementary school.<ref name=rcinterview>{{cite magazine| title=The Roy Clark Interview| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=December 28, 1985| pages=RC-4, RC-12| access-date=November 15, 2018| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Roy%20Clark%22%20%22National%20Banjo%20Championship%22&pg=PT77}}</ref> His father taught Clark to play guitar{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} when Roy was 14 years old, and soon Clark was playing banjo, guitar, and [[mandolin]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}} "Guitar was my real love, though," Clark later said. "I never copied anyone, but I was certainly influenced by them; especially by [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]]. I just loved his swing style and tone."{{sfn|Ferguson|1979|page=68}}

Clark also found inspiration in other local D.C. musicians. "One of the things that influenced me growing up around Washington, D.C., in the '50s was that it had an awful lot of good musicians. And I used to go in and just steal them blind. I stole all their licks. It wasn't until years later that I found out that a lot of them used to cringe and say 'Oh, no! Here comes that kid again'<ref name=rcinterview /> when I'd come in.  As for his banjo style, Clark said in 1985, "When I started playing, you didn't have many choices to follow, and [[Earl Scruggs]] was both of them."<ref name=rcinterview />  Clark won the National Banjo Championship in 1947 and 1948,{{sfn|Ferguson|1979|page=68}} and briefly toured with a band when he was 15.{{sfn|Ferguson|1979|page=68}}

Clark was very shy, and turned to humor as a way of easing his timidity. [[Country-western]] music was widely derided by Clark's schoolmates, leaving him socially isolated. Clowning around, he felt, helped him to fit in again. Clark used humor as a musician as well, and it was not until the mid 1960s that he felt confident enough to perform in public without using humor in his act.<ref name=rcinterview />

The D.C. area had a number of country-western music venues at the time. Duet acts were in favor, and for his public performance debut Clark teamed up with Carl Lukat. Lukat was the lead guitarist, and Clark supported him on rhythm guitar.<ref name=rcinterview /> In 1949, at the age of 16, Clark made his television debut on [[WTTG]], the [[DuMont Television Network]] affiliate in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} At 17, he made his first appearance on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}} in recognition for winning his second national banjo title.{{sfn|Ferguson|1979|page=68}} By this time, he had begun to play fiddle and [[twelve-string guitar]].{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|page=88}} He toured the country for the next 18 months playing backup guitar during the week for [[David "Stringbean" Akeman]], [[Danny Dill|Annie Lou and Danny]], [[Lonzo and Oscar]], and [[Velma Williams Smith|Hal and Velma Smith]], working [[Agricultural show|county fairs]] and small town theaters. On weekends, these acts usually teamed up with country music superstars like [[Red Foley]] or [[Ernest Tubb]] and played large venues in big cities. He earned $150 a week (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|150|1950}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}} dollars).<ref name=rcinterview /> After the tour, Clark returned to performing at local country-music venues. He recorded singles for [[Coral Records]] and [[4 Star Records]].<ref name=rcinterview />

At the age of 23, Clark obtained his pilot's certificate and then bought a 1953 [[Piper PA-20 Pacer|Piper Tri-Pacer]] (N1132C), which he flew for many years. This plane was raffled off on December 17, 2012, to benefit the charity [[Wings of Hope (charity)|Wings of Hope]].<ref>{{cite journal| title=Winner of Roy Clark's Tripacer named| journal=General Aviation News| url=http://www.generalaviationnews.com/2012/01/winner-of-roy-clarks-tripacer-named/| last=Wood| first=Janice| date=January 26, 2012| access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> He owned other planes, including a [[Mitsubishi MU-2]], [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman PT-17]]<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20069138,00.html |title=Hanging Loose at 1,500 Feet, Upside-Down Roy Clark Prays, 'Seat Belt, Do Your Stuff'| magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=September 26, 1977 |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> and [[Hawker 400|Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] 1A [[business jet]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.great-music.net/rclark.html| title=Roy Clark biodata| publisher=Great-music.net| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001140722/http://www.great-music.net/rclark.html | archive-date=October 1, 2016 | url-status=dead | access-date=April 25, 2015}}</ref>

In the mid-1960s, he was a co-host (along with [[Molly Bee]] and [[Rusty Draper]]) of a weekday daytime country variety series for NBC entitled "Swingin' Country", which was canceled after two seasons. In 1969, Clark and [[Buck Owens]] debuted as hosts on the syndicated [[sketch comedy]] program ''[[Hee Haw]]'' which aired from 1969 until 1997 and propelled Clark to stardom.

'''Roy Kelton Orbison''' (April 23, 1936&nbsp;– December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist known for his distinctive and powerful voice, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. Orbison's music is mostly in the [[rock music]] genre and his most successful periods were in the early 1960s and the late 1980s. He was nicknamed "The [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock" and "The Big&nbsp;O". Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers projected [[machismo]]. He performed with minimal motion and in black clothes, matching his dyed black hair and dark [[sunglasses]].

Born in Texas, Orbison began singing in a [[Country music|country-and-western]] band as a teenager. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956 after 
[[Johnny Cash]] urged him to go to [[Sun Records|Sun]]. [[Elvis]] was leaving Sun and Phillips was looking to replace him. His first [[Sun]] recording, [[Ooby Dooby]] was a direct musical sound-a-like of Elvis's early Sun recordings. He had some success at [[Sun]] but enjoyed his greatest success with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40. He wrote or {{Nowrap|co-wrote}} almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including "[[Only the Lonely]]" (1960), "[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]" (1961), "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" (1961), "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" (1963), and "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" (1964).

After the mid-1960s Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies, and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s, following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he {{Nowrap|co-founded}} the [[Traveling Wilburys]] supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack that December at age 52. One month later, his song "[[You Got It]]" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach both the US and UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.

Orbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. He received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and five other Grammy Awards. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on its list of the "Greatest Artists of All Time" and number 13 on its list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.

He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 21.</ref> leading Orbison to adopt the stage name "Lefty Wilbury" during his time with the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]], [[Bob Wills]], [[Moon Mullican]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians that he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. Orbison also said that a formative experience was the regular singing sessions at Fort Worth, where he was surrounded by soldiers who were intensely emotional because they were about to be sent to the front line in World War II. In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]], [[western swing]], [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music. The cajun favorite "[[Jole Blon]]" was one of the first songs that he sang in public. He began singing on a local radio show at age 8, and he became the show's host by the late 1940s.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p8-9}} At the age of 9, Orbison won a contest on radio station [[KVWC (AM)|KVWC]], which led to his own radio show where he sang the same songs every week.<ref name=offbio/> He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School<ref name="Orbison-2017-28" /> in Fort Worth until a polio scare in 1944 prompted his parents to send Roy (then aged 8) and his brother Grady Lee to Vernon to live with their grandmother.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p8}} As World War II wound down, Roy's parents returned to Vernon.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p3}}

In 1949, Orbison (then 13 years old) formed the band ''Wink Westerners''<ref name=offbio/> with school friends Billy Pat Ellis on drums, Slob Evans on bass fiddle, Richard West on piano, and James Morrow on electric mandolin.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p16}} They played country and [[western swing]] standards and [[Glenn Miller]] jazz swing songs at local [[honky-tonk]] bars and had a weekly morning radio show on [[KERB (AM)|KERB]] in [[Kermit, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |title=History Maker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401175007/http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |website=The Official Roy Orbison Site |access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> Their first performance was at a school assembly in 1953.<ref name=offbio/> They were offered $400 to play at a dance, and Orbison realized that he could make a living in music.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p23}} Orbison was also part of a [[marching band]] and singing [[Octet (music)|octet]].<ref name=offbio/> At the age of 15, Orbison decided that instead of becoming a guitar player, he would use the guitar as an accompaniment to his singing.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p26}}

In 1953 the Wink Westerners entered a talent contest on [[KMID-TV]] in [[Midland, Texas]].{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} The group won the contest, resulting in a 30-minute spot on a local television show.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p27}} After the show, Orbison asked the owner of the company sponsoring the show if he could sponsor the group for ongoing shows, which led to the Wink Westerners playing weekly shows on KMID-TV on Friday nights and on Odessa television station [[KOSA-TV]] on Saturday nights.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p28}}{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} It was around this time that Orbison began dyeing his hair (naturally a "dishwater grey color") to jet black.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p28}}

After graduating from high school in 1954, Orbison enrolled at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]]. His plan was to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay; however, he became bored with the course in its first year and switched to History and English.<ref name=offbio/> But Orbison preferred to play music with fellow students Billy Pat Ellis, [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p29-30}} Penner and Moore had written a simple, catchy rockabilly song called "Ooby Dooby", which impressed Orbison and he started looking into how he could make a recording of it.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p30}} Orbison continued performing with the Wink Westerners after his first year.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} He then heard that his schoolmate [[Pat Boone]] had signed a record deal, and it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p30}} At a New Year's Eve dance in 1954, the Wink Westerners had mostly played country and [[western swing]] music throughout the night, but ended the night by playing [[Bill Haley & the Comets]]’ hit song ''[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]'' repeatedly, which became the catalyst for the band switching to [[rock and roll]] music.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p31}} Also, Orbison had seen [[Elvis Presley]] perform back during his days at North Texas State College in 1954 and was impressed by the shocking gyrations that Elvis exhibited on stage.{{efn|Orbison later said that he "couldn't overemphasize how shocking" Presley looked and seemed to him that night.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 26–27.</ref>}}

===1955–1956: ''The Teen Kings''===
{{main|Roy Orbison's Sun recordings}}
At the end of the spring semester of 1955, Orbison dropped out of North Texas State College, switching to [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College.]]<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p32}} The Wink Westerners were disbanded in the fall of 1955 and Orbison formed a new band called ''The Teen Kings''.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} The band was made of Orbison, Billy Pat Ellis and James Morrow from the Wink Westerners, plus Jack Kennelly on bass and Johnny Wilson.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p32}} It was at a dance event where ''The Teen Kings'' performed that Orbison met his future wife Claudette Frady.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p30}} Claudette was fourteen at the time, five years younger than Orbison.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}}

''The Teen Kings'''s first recording was the song ''Ooby Dooby'', which was recorded at [[Norman Petty]]'s studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]] in March 1956.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=254}} It was published by Odessa-based start-up label [[Je–Wel]]<ref name="escott"/>{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=245}} as the B-side of the ''JE-WEL 101'' single.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p36}} The A-side of the single was ''Tryin' to Get to You'', a song previously recorded by Elvis Presley.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p36}}

After ''Ooby Dooby'' was published by Je-Wel Records, Orbison became convinced that a larger record company would be able to sell more copies of the record, and he spoke to a lawyer about breaking the contract with Je-Wel.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}} Initially, Orbison obtained an injunction to prevent Je-Wel from distributing the record, before they reached an agreement that the band would pay back the label the costs of producing the records.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}} Orbison was now free to find a new label to market Ooby Dooby; however, a further setback was that he cut a demo of the song for [[Columbia Records]] which they turned down but had one of their contract artists ([[Sid King]]) release a recording of ''Ooby Dooby'' before Orbison could offer the tape to another record company.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p40}}

Eventually, [[Sun Records]] would sign up to record ''Ooby Dooby'', but the events that led to this are disputed.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}} Some claim that [[Johnny Cash]] toured the Odessa area in 1955 and 1956,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} Cash stated that "in late '55 or early '56, I was touring with Elvis when I met Roy in Texas... I told him to get in touch with Sun Records if he wanted to be a recording artist". Orbison has said that when he did this, [[Sam Phillips]] (the owner of [[Sun Records]]) told him "Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}} However, both Sam Philips and Billy Pat Ellis (the band's drummer) have disputed that Johnny Cash was involved.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42-43}} Three of ''The Teen Kings'' band members have said that their relationship with Sun Records began when Odessa record store owner Poppa Holifield played it over the telephone for Sam Phillips in April 1956, and Phillips offered the Teen Kings a contract.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}}<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}}

The Teen Kings went to [[Sun Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], in order to re-record ''Ooby Dooby'' for publication by [[Sun Records]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p42}} After an audition of the song, Sam Phillips signed the band up for "a year or two".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p47}} However, the band's career soon slumped, since Orbison wanted to record emotional ballads rather than the rockabilly songs demanded by Sam Phillips, and Phillips's goal for a successor to Elvis Presley had moved on from Orbison to [[Carl Perkins]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p51}} ''The Teen Kings'' were granted a reprieve when Carl Perkins was badly injured in a car crash, resulting in ''Ooby Dooby'' being released (along with ''Go Go Go'') as Sun Single 242 in May 1956.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p51}}{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} ''The Teen Kings'' began an experimental tour of [[drive-in theatre|drive-in theaters]] in the southern U.S. states (playing on top of projection house roofs between drive-in film showings) with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], [[Carl Perkins]], and Johnny Cash.<ref name="offbio" /> Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing "everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record".<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 44.</ref> Orbison also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including ''[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]'' and ''Rockhouse''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Orbison|first1=Roy Jr.|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last2=Orbison Alex|last3=Orbison|first3=Wesley|last4=Slate|first4=Jeff|publisher=Center Street|date=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|location=New York|pages=50, 57|language=English|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> In June 1956, ''Ooby Dooby'' peaked at number 59 in the Billboard charts and sold 200,000 copies,<ref name="escott"/> however the follow-up singles didn't reach the charts.<ref name="offbio"/>

''The Teen Kings'' played alongside Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Warren Smith and Eddie Bond at the [[Overton Park Shell]] on June 1, 1956, but Orbison's relationship with the rest of the band was deteriorating at this stage.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} Elvis Presley was in the audience for this show and Orbison claimed that Elvis praised Orbison, but another band member says that it was actually Jack Kennelly (the band's bass player) that Presley praised.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} Kennelly said that "Roy's dream was to be a star, and once Sam (Phillips) inflated his ego he couldn't be a part of a unit. Roy became egomaniacal".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} In the summer of 1956, Orbison purchased a brand-new purple Cadillac and a diamond ring with his first royalty cheque from ''Ooby Dooby'';<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}} however, the band soon found out that their pay cheques from the concerts were not covering their costs and that life as a touring band was a demoralizing experience.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p55}} The band's contract didn't include any royalty payments ("BMI") when their songs were played on the radio and Orbison had run out of money by late 1956.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p58}} Orbison was encouraged by Norman Petty to record a single without ''The Teen Kings'' and the rest of the band walked on Roy during a recording session when told of a plan to rename the band ''Roy Orbison and The Teen Kings''.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p56}} The band broke up in December 1956<ref name="offbio" /> and Sam Phillips said they were arguing about money but the basic problem was that Orbison was too much of a loner and driven egoist.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p61}} The lack of a band was a serious problem for Orbison's contract at Sun Records, since the label had no use for a singer who didn't have a band.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p61}}

===1956–1959: Solo work and Acuff-Rose Music===
[[File:Roy Orbison 1965 (2).png|thumb|Orbison with his original thick-rimmed glasses ({{circa|1950s–1960s}})]]

After ''The Teen Kings'' split, Orbison stayed in Memphis with his girlfriend Claudette.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, and Phillips stated that they didn't sleep together in his house.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p63}} However, Orbison was broke and realized that he couldn't survive as a recording artist, so after several weeks he returned to the road. He toured with Johnny Cash, Sonny Burgess, Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, playing mostly songs from other artists before finishing the set with a song of his own.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p64}} At the time, Orbison was addicted to sleeping pills and speed.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p67}} Orbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, and at some stage picked up a date for Presley in his purple [[Cadillac]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p53}}

In August 1957, Orbison returned to the Sun Recording Studio and recorded several new songs with just his acoustic guitar instead of a backing band.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p68}} However, none were successful and Roy gave up on becoming a recording artist.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p68}} Sam Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p60-61}} Orbison returned to Odessa, Texas in the fall of 1957 to be together with his sixteen-year-old girlfriend, Claudette.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p69}} The two began to talk about getting married. On a professional level, Orbison met singer [[Joe Melson]] while in Memphis, who would collaborate with Orbison on his biggest hit songs in the early 1960s.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p70}}

A ballad Orbison wrote, ''The Clown'', met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref> Nonetheless, he continued to pitch his ballad ''[[Claudette (song)|Claudette]]'' (which he began working on in early 1956) to singers he met on tour<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p68}} and in April 1958 [[The Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of their hit ''[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]''.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p76}} ''Claudette'' reached number 30 in the charts in March 1959.<ref name="offbio" /> Orbison then left Sun Records, due to a dispute about royalties from the song ''Claudette'' (which was recorded by Nashville Records).<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p72}} Orbison and Claudette had married in 1957 and their first child was born on September 16, 1958.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p76}} Using the royalty payments from The Everly Brothers hit ''Claudette'', Orbison bought the most expensive new pink Cadillac available.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p76}} However, Roy and Claudette spent the money lavishly and were soon broke and living with Roy's parents in Wink.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p78}}

Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>

During the period of 1958–1959, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music]],<ref name="offbio" /> a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison then worked with, and was in awe of, [[Chet Atkins]] (who had played guitar with Presley) and attempted to sell his recordings of songs by other writers to the [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] record label. One of these songs was ''Seems to Me'', by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of "a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then—softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>

Playing shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68–69.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs for [[RCA Victor]] at their [[RCA Studio B|Nashville studios]]; only two singles (''Paper Boy'' and ''With the Bug''<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p86}}) were judged worthy of release by the label.<ref name="Zak, p. 32.">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]], the record label that Orbison would soon switch to.<ref name="offbio" />

=== 1960–1964: Monument Records and stardom ===
====Early singles====
[[File:Roy Orbison - Cash Box 1960.png|160px|thumb|Orbison on the cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'', September 3, 1960]]

In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA Victor had refused, "Paper Boy". It was accompanied by the B-side sing "With the Bug", but neither song charted.<ref name="Zak, p. 33.">Zak, p. 33.</ref>

Orbison's own style, the sound created at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Victor Studio B]] in Nashville with pioneer engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a "polished, professional sound... finally allowing Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein".<ref name="Zak, p. 32."/> Orbison requested to use [[string instrument|string instruments]] instead of [[fiddle|fiddles]], which was unusual for the time.<ref name="offbio" /><ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p87}} He recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was "Uptown", written with Joe Melson and released in late 1959.<ref name="offbio" /><ref name="Lehman, p. 48.">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, "We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world."<ref name="escott"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70–71.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville "brought a new splendour to rock", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>

"Uptown" was a modest hit and the first song by Orbison and Melson to reach the ''Billboard'' Top 100.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p89}} His initial success came just as the 1950s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>

====''Only the Lonely''====
[[File:Blue Angel - Today's Teardrops - Billboard ad 1960.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, September 12, 1960]] 
Experimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from "Uptown", and another song they had written called "Come Back to Me (My Love)", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name="Zak, p. 35.">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, "came not from his throat but deeper within".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was "[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]". Orbison was passing through Memphis when he tried to pitch the song to Elvis Presley (along with several other songs) in order to make some money quickly, but it was early in the morning and Presley did not want to see Orbison at that time.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p91}} Orbison and Melson instead recorded the song at RCA Victor's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name="Lehman, p. 48."/><ref>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter-Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name="Zak, p. 35."/>

"Only the Lonely" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia.<ref name="offbio" /> According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, "I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of "Ooby Dooby" and "Only the Lonely", it kind of turned into a good voice."<ref name="rockhall">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> But at the time of its recording, Orbison was struggling to earn a living, because he was only working as a singer at local dances.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p94}} Also the days of his working with Melson were numbered, due to disagreements such as who came up with the title for ''Only the Lonely''.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p95}} The success of ''Only The Lonely'' transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard "Only the Lonely" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p98}}

Soon after recording an early version of his next hit ''[[Blue Angel (song)|Blue Angel]]'', Orbison and his wife and son (Roy DeWayne, born in 1958) moved from Wink to the suburb of Hendersonville in [[Nashville]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p94}} Orbison's second son, Anthony King, would follow in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Orbison|first1=Roy Jr.|title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|last2=Orbison Alex|last3=Orbison|first3=Wesley|last4=Slate|first4=Jeff|publisher=Center Street|date=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|location=New York|page=92|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> Melson also moved to Hendersonville soon after, and began working on ''Blue Angel'' together, which was recorded in August 1960.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p102}} This hit was a more complex song, yet it still peaked at number nine in the USA.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p102}} The follow-up single ''I'm Hurtin''' (with ''[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]'' as the B-side) rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} After the success of ''Blue Angel'', Orbison undertook a hectic touring schedule, often performing with his neighbor [[Patsy Cline]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p103}} During this time, Claudette was lonely and unhappy, and some people said that Orbison was unfaithful to her while he was on tour.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p104}}

Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of "Only the Lonely", "Blue Angel", and "I'm Hurtin'",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Orbison |first1=Roy |last2=Orbison |first2=Alex |last3=Orbison |first3=Wesley |last4=Slate |first4=Jeff |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison |publisher=Center Street |location=New York |date=2017 |page=245 |oclc=1017566749 |isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7}}</ref> Orbison worked on a new song, "[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]", about a man worried that his girlfriend is about to leave him for another man.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p106}} Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio, and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81–82.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, "Running Scared" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, "He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before."<ref name="escott"/> Just weeks later "Running Scared" became Orbison's first number one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart<ref name="offbio" /> and it reached number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected "Running Scared": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}

The B-side ''Crying'' followed soon after and reached the top 5 singles in August 1961.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p107}} ''Crying'' was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, ''[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]'', written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} By the end of 1961, Orbison had recorded six hit singles in a row over the past two years.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p107}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as "The Big O"{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}, partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with "[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. Orbison enlisted The Webbs, from Dothan, Alabama, as his backing band. The band changed their names to ''The Candy Men'' (in reference to Roy's hit) and played with Orbison from 1962 to 1967.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Orbison |first1=Roy Jr. |last2=Orbison |first2=Alex |last3=Orbison |first3=Wesley |last4=Slate |first4=Jeff |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison |publisher=Center Street |location=New York |date=2017 |page=137 |oclc=1017566749 |isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7}}</ref> They later went on to have their own career, releasing a few singles and two albums on their own. Also in 1962, he charted with "The Crowd", "Leah", and "Workin' for the Man", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p32}} Orbison's relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating, over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>

Orbison first met [[Bob Dylan]] at Dylan's 21st birthday party in May 1962.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p112}}

From 1959–1963, Orbison was the top selling American artist and one of the world’s biggest names.<ref name="offbio" />

Orbison eventually developed an image that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, and therefore had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an "anonymous celebrity".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Faosa sunglasses on stage<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p109}} and found that he preferred them.

====''In Dreams'' and international tours====
Orbison's string of top-40 hits continued with "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" (US number 7 in January 1963,<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p114}} UK number 6), "Falling" (US number 22, UK number 9), and "[[Mean Woman Blues]]" (US number 5, UK number 3) coupled with "[[Blue Bayou]]" (US number 29, UK number 3).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name="britishhits">Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.</ref> According to the discography in ''The Authorized Roy Orbison'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Orbison |first1=Roy Jr. |last2=Orbison |first2=Alex |last3=Orbison |first3=Wesley |last4=Slate |first4=Jeff |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison |location=New York |edition=1st |year=2017 |page=245 |oclc=1017566749 |isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7}}</ref> a rare alternative version of "Blue Bayou" was released in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], "[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).

As "In Dreams" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with [[the Beatles]]. The tour sold out in one afternoon.<ref name="offbio" /> When Orbison arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, "What's a Beatle, anyway?" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, "I am".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p115}} On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison simply played through 14 encores.<ref name="clayson109-113">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109–113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting "We want Roy!" again, Lennon and [[Paul McCartney]] physically held Orbison back.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p117}} [[Ringo Starr]] later said, "In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything."<ref name="clayson109-113"/> Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.<ref>Lennon, John; McCartney, Paul; Harrison, George; Starr, Ringo (2002). ''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94.</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was [[George Harrison]] with whom he would later form a strong friendship.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

In 1963, touring took a toll on Orbison's personal life. After discovering a letter from one of Orbison's secret girlfriends, his wife Claudette had an affair with the builder of their home in Tennessee.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p120}} Billy Pat Ellis said "Claudette had the affair because Roy was gone a lot and she got lonely and wanted to prove she was attractive again".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p120}} When Orbison toured Britain again in the autumn of 1963, she joined him.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p122-3}} 

Later in 1963, Orbison toured England, Ireland and Canada.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p122}} In 1964, he toured Australia and New Zealand with the [[Beach Boys]]<ref name="offbio" /> and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p125}} He traveled to Australia again in 1965, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]].<ref name="offbio" /> [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, "a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p134}}

Orbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote "[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]", a number-one hit in the UK and Orbison's most successful song.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p126}} When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, "A pretty woman never needs any money".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p127}} Just 40 minutes later, "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the autumn of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending a total of 18 weeks on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name="escott"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p128}}

===1965–1969: Career decline and tragedies===
[[File:Roy Orbison 1967.png|thumb|Orbison in 1967]]
By late 1964, Orbison had "occasionally treated himself to a [[groupie]]"<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p130}} and his wife Claudette had had an affair with the builder Braxton Dixon, who had built Orbison's house.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p121}} After Roy became aware of the affair, he fired Dixon and finished building the house himself (with the help of a hired carpenter).<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p132}} In early 1965, Roy confirmed that he and Claudette were divorced.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p132}} Later in 1965, Claudette gave birth to Roy's third child, and Roy and Claudette re-united several months later.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p143}}

Orbison's singles in early 1965 had been unsuccessful and his contract with Monument was expiring soon.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p137}} Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to [[MGM Records]] (though in Europe he remained with [[Decca Records|Decca's]] [[London Records]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/hlu9986 |title=Roy Orbison - Ride Away / Wondering - London - UK - HLU 9986 |website=45cat |access-date=August 29, 2015}}</ref>) for $1&nbsp;million<ref name="offbio" /> and with the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast, and when not touring, writing, or recording, he dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130–131.</ref> The move was described as Orbison "joining the ranks of fading rock stars fleeing to MGM".<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p137}}

Rose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Victor's A-Team in Nashville.<ref name="Zak, p. 33."/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name="escott"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964–65, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation (Orbison was 28 in 1964) were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref> The contractual requirement to release a certain amount of singles and albums per year for MGM also took its toll on the quality of Orbison's songs.<ref name="offbio" />

Orbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p126}} While on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to Britain to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}

Roy and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles after Roy had been introduced to them by Elvis Presley.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p54}} Orbison was a daredevil driver, blasting around on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and owning a Ferrari car, which he used to challenge other drivers to race him on the highway.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p1}} On June 6, 1966, when Orbison and Claudette were both riding their motorcycles home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]], she was struck by a pickup truck in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref> and thrown into the air. She was taken by ambulance to hospital, but her liver was seriously injured and she died, aged 25.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p148}}

A grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well.<ref name="offbio" /> It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108–109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole and had to protect and deliver a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]] and was supplied with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line "I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time", with, according to biographer [[Colin Escott]], "zero conviction".<ref name="escott"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box-office failure. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 146–147.</ref><ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p151-3}}

He recorded an album dedicated to the songs of [[Don Gibson]] and another of [[Hank Williams]] covers, but both sold poorly.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p153}} During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison lost mainstream appeal, yet seemed confident that this would return, later saying: "[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to, so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref> Orbison's single ''Cry Softly Lonely One'' from March 1967 was his last song to enter the Top 100 until the 1980s.<ref name="offbio" />

During a tour of Britain and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161–63.</ref> This occurred two years after the death of his wife Claudette and Orbison's grief meant he couldn't write songs.<ref name="offbio" /> Fire officials stated that the cause of the fire may have been an [[aerosol]] can, which possibly contained [[lacquer]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hendersonville, TN Home Fire Roy Orbison's House, Sep 1968 {{!}} GenDisasters ...

During the 1968 tour of England, Orbison and his childhood friend Bobby Blackburn slept with many girls over the course of two months, and used a calendar on the wall to track when each girl was arriving and leaving their rented apartment in Upper Brook Street in London.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p156}} During this time, Orbison met the sixteen year-old German girl [[Barbara Orbison|Barbara Wellhonen]], with whom he became fascinated,<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p156}} although Orbison continued to see other girls in the meantime.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p157}} On May 25, 1969,<ref name="offbio" /> Orbison and Wellhonen got married.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p163}} Roy was 33 years old at the time, and sources vary regarding whether Wellhonen was either 17, 18 or 19.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p163}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bandweblogs.com/blog/2008/10/10/barbara-orbison-exclusive-interview/ | title=Barbara Orbison EXCLUSIVE interview – Band Weblogs }}</ref> Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents. Orbison and Wellhonen had a son (Roy Kelton) in 1970 and another ([[Alex Orbison|Alexander]]) in 1975.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 178.</ref>

===1970s: Struggles===
[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]

Orbison continued recording albums in the 1970s, but his career went nowhere during this decade<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p169}}. In 1974 he switched record labels from MGM to [[Mercury Records]] for a one-album deal.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p170}}<ref name="offbio" /> Although the peak of his success was over, his single ''Penny Arcade'' was number one in Australia for many weeks and ''Too Soon to Know'' reached number 3 in England.<ref name="offbio" /> His fortunes sank so low in America that his concerts were mostly empty, such as the concert at Cincinnati Gardens that he played on his fortieth birthday in April 1976<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p174}}. Peter Lehman observed that Orbison's absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: "Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone."<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released popular covers of his songs. Orbison's version of "[[Love Hurts]]" was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by hard rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]]' version of "Only the Lonely" reached number one on the country music charts.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p167-8}} [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of "Dream Baby".

A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits reached number one in the UK in January 1976, and Orbison began to open concerts that year for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who had started as [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backup band. Ronstadt herself covered "[[Blue Bayou]]" in 1977, her version reaching number three on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p178}} He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded ''[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]'' with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.

In late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to spend the winter in Hawaii. He checked in to a hospital there where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]] and was barely alive<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p177}}. Orbison underwent open-heart surgery on January 18, 1978.<ref name="offbio" /> He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183–184.</ref> Orbison said he felt rejuvenated after the procedure; however, he continued to smoke cigarettes, despite the advice of his doctor<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p178}}.

=== 1980–1988: Revival and Traveling Wilburys ===
[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|right|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]
In 1980, [[Don McLean]] recorded a cover of Orbison's 1961 hit single "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]"{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} and it went to the top of the charts, first in the Netherlands then reaching number five in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was number one in the UK for three weeks and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p182}} In 1981 he performed "Pretty Woman" on an episode of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0567227/|title = The Great Hazzard Hijack| website=[[IMDb]] |date = March 27, 1981}}</ref> Orbison was all but forgotten in the US, yet he reached popularity in less likely places such as [[Bulgaria]] in 1982.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964, and he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p183}} In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet "That Lovin' You Feelin' Again" from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'' (in which Orbison also played a cameo role), and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was Orbison's first Grammy, and he felt hopeful of making a full return to popular music,<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of "Oh, Pretty Woman" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's music.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}

Orbison, his wife and two oldest children moved from Nashville to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] in 1986<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p189}}. Following the move, Orbison's involvement with the Los Angeles creative community proved to be very important for him<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p214}}.

It has been alleged that Orbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of "In Dreams" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986),<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p191}} although Lynch has stated to the contrary that he and his producers obtained permission to use the song without speaking to Orbison in the first place.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXoqN6mPGPE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/GXoqN6mPGPE| archive-date=December 11, 2021|title=David Lynch on working with Roy Orbison |author=adamzanzie |website=youtube.com |date=September 5, 2019 |access-date=August 20, 2021 |url-status=live}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Lynch's first choice for a song had actually been "Crying";{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}} the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by Ben ([[Dean Stockwell]]), Booth's drug dealer boss, using an industrial work light as a pretend microphone, lighting his face.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=Dean Stockwell in 'Blue Velvet': The Movie That Made Him Timeless |url=https://variety.com/2021/film/columns/dean-stockwell-blue-velvet-quantum-leap-1235108606/ |work=Variety |date=November 9, 2021}}</ref> In later scenes, Booth demands the song be played repeatedly; also wanting the song while beating the protagonist.<ref>{{cite web |last=Oisin H.C |first=Toni |title=How 'Blue Velvet's Frank Booth Is an Allegory for Internalized Homophobia |url=https://collider.com/blue-velvet-frank-booth-toxic-masculinity/ |website=Collider |language=en |date=December 1, 2021}}</ref> During filming, Lynch would also sit his cast down every few hours and ask them to listen to the song.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p193}} Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, "I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'."<ref name="escott"/> The use of Orbison's song in the film greatly helped Orbison's comeback.<ref name="offbio" />

In 1987, Orbison released an album of re-recorded hits titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. "Life Fades Away", a song he co-wrote with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]] and recorded, was featured in the film ''[[Less than Zero (film)|Less than Zero]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |access-date=July 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archive-date=February 19, 2015 }}</ref> He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of "Crying" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987); the pair received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] after Orbison's death.<ref name="grammy">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=Grammy Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>

Also in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and was initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison."<ref name="clayson202-203">Clayson, Alan, pp. 202–203.</ref> In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt "validated" by the honor.<ref name="clayson202-203"/> After the awards, Orbison signed with [[Virgin Records]], who immediately released a "greatest hits" album and began preparing for an album of new songs.<ref name="offbio" />

A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]], [[JD Souther]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |access-date=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p207}} The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p205}} The concert is considered a landmark in Orbison's career.<ref name="offbio" />

The creation of the world's most recognized [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]],<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/supergroups-from-cream-and-traveling-wilburys-to-audioslave-and-chickenfoot-140540/cream-38577/ | title=Supergroups: From Cream and Traveling Wilburys to Audioslave and Chickenfoot | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=December 3, 2010 }}</ref> '''[[Traveling Wilburys]]''' began in 1987 when Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album.<ref name="offbio" /> Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Slate, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p218}} By that evening, the group had written "[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself "Lefty Wilbury" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206–207.</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/traveling-wilburys-vol-1-103329/|title=Traveling Wilburys Volume One|first1=David|last1=Wild|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 18, 1988}}</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: "Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p221}}

Lynne later spoke of the recording sessions: "Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'&nbsp;... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 208.</ref> The band's debut album, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' (1988), was released on October 25, 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-traveling-wilburys-vol-1-mw0000787431|title=The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1 - The Traveling Wilburys &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|via=www.allmusic.com}}</ref> Orbison was given one solo track, "[[Not Alone Any More]]", on the album.

Orbison determinedly pursued his second chance at stardom, but he expressed amazement at his success: "It's very nice to be wanted again, but I still can't quite believe it."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p223}} He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, as well as the newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.<ref name=Pond/>

Orbison completed a solo comeback album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]'', in November 1988.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p227-8}} ''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]].

==Posthumous career==
Orbison's posthumous album ''Mystery Girl'' was released by [[Virgin Records]] on January 31, 1989<ref>{{Cite book|title=The authorized Roy Orbison|last=Orbison|first=Roy Jr.|publisher=Center Street|others=Orbison, Wesley,, Orbison, Alex,, Slate, Jeff|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|edition= Second|location=New York|page=235|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> and became the highest selling album of his career.<ref name="offbio" /> The biggest hit from ''Mystery Girl'' was "[[You Got It]]", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. "You Got It" rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name="britishhits"/> The song earned Orbison a posthumous Grammy Award nomination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/life_after_death_the_best_and_worst_posthumous_albums/s1__31845896|title=Life after death: The best and worst posthumous albums|date=November 16, 2020|website=Yardbarker}}</ref> According to ''Rolling Stone'', "Mystery Girl cloaks the epic sweep and grandeur of his classic sound in meticulous, modern production—the album encapsulates everything that made Orbison great, and for that reason it makes a fitting valedictory".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/mystery-girl-249142/|title=Mystery Girl|first1=Michael|last1=Azerrad|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 23, 1989}}</ref>

''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and No. 16 in the UK.

Although the video for the Traveling Wilburys' "Handle with Care" was filmed with Orbison, the video for "[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]" was filmed and released posthumously.

Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]], heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion.<ref>Lehman, p. 8.</ref> Few of Orbison's recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll.{{according to whom|date=July 2021}} Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, "He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth."<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as "the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]"<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p97}}<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> and "the Big O".<ref name="rollingstone.com"/>

===Song structures===
Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions "define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music".<ref>Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, "He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity".<ref name="watrous">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). "Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>

In the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like "Ooby Dooby" and "Claudette". Orbison's "In Dreams" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In "Running Scared", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. "Crying" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before "Only the Lonely", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name="nswhof">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>

{{blockquote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way.&nbsp;... So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes&nbsp;... But that's always after the fact—as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me. | Roy Orbison}}

[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made "radical left turns", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of "Running Scared" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, "Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p128}}

===Lyrical themes===
Critic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as "Go! Go! Go!" and "Mean Woman Blues" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70–71.</ref>

In 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: "Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy—try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention."<ref name="escott"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are "dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces".<ref name="watrous"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the "apocalyptic romanticism" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was "so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia", striking "a post-modern nerve".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: "The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically."<ref name="hall"/>

The loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely."<ref name="hall"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, "He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things&nbsp;... Before that no one would do it."<ref name="hall"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: "When ["Crying"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry."<ref name="hall"/>

===Voice quality===
{{Quote box
 | width = 30%
 | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time. All his vocal gymnastics were just a means to a powerful end, not a mission unto themselves. Roy Orbison didn't just sing beautifully—he sang brokenheartedly.
| source = —[[Stephen Thompson (journalist)|Stephen Thompson]], [[NPR]]<ref name="NPRsongswelove">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/28/135734524/roy-orbison-songs-we-love |title=Roy Orbison: Songs We Love |author=NPR staff |website=NPR |date=April 27, 2011 |access-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref>
}}

Orbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until "Only the Lonely" in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its "flowering".<ref>Lehman, p. 50.</ref> Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Jeanette MacDonald]] standard "[[Indian Love Call]]", and had the audience completely silenced, in awe.<ref>Lehman, p. 49.</ref> When compared to The Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with "a passionate intensity" that, according to ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', made "his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [seem] to be coming to an end—not with a whimper, but an agonised, beautiful bang".<ref name=decurtis155/>

Bruce Springsteen and [[Billy Joel]] both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison's voice. [[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like "the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard "Crying" for the first time, "That was it. To me that was the voice of God."<ref name="hall">Hall, Mark. (director) ''In Dreams: The Roy Orbison Story'', Nashmount Productions Inc., 1999.</ref> Elvis Presley stated Orbison's voice was the greatest and most distinctive he <!--check who 'they' are---> had ever heard.<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p175,193}} Orbison's music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and songwriter [[Will Jennings]], among others.{{sfn|Lehman|ref=none|p=21}} Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence, remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s:<ref>Dylan, p. 33.</ref>{{Which|reason=Which source is this referring to?|date=October 2019}}

{{blockquote|With Roy, you didn't know if you were listening to mariachi or opera. He kept you on your toes. With him, it was all about fat and blood. He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop. [After "Ooby Dooby"] he was now singing his compositions in three or four octaves that made you want to drive your car over a cliff. He sang like a professional criminal&nbsp;... His voice could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, "Man, I don't believe it". | Bob Dylan}}

Likewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with "Crying" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: "The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p184}} Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, "Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it."<ref>Scheff, Jerry (2012). ''Way Down: Playing Bass with Elvis, Dylan, the Doors & More.'' Backbeat Books. p. 33.</ref>

His voice ranged from [[baritone]] to [[tenor]], and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range.<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Grady |first=Terence J. |date=February 2000 |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-02294.html |title=Orbison, Roy |website=American National Biography |url-access=subscription |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref>

Orbison's severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name="Lehman, p. 24">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.<ref>{{Citation|last=Townsend|first=Paul|title=Roy Orbison, March 1967, Colston Hall, Bristol|date=January 2, 2014|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/11707869923/|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref>

===Live performances===
[[File:Roy Orbison.jpg|thumb|250 px|Orbison, center (in white), performing in 1976]]
Orbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like "Mean Woman Blues" did offer that.<ref>Lehman, p. 62.</ref> He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, "I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like [[Chubby Checker]] or [[Bobby Rydell]] in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them."<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 78.</ref>

[[k.d. lang]] compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lang, k. d. |date=April 15, 2004 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |title=The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time: 37) Roy Orbison |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506004850/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison |archive-date=May 6, 2009}}</ref> This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by [[John Belushi]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing "Oh, Pretty Woman", and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again.<ref name="Lehman, p. 24"/> However, Lang quantified this style by saying, "It's so hard to explain what Roy's energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence, but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there."<ref name="hall"/>

Orbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings playing the driving rhythm of western swing, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily with him. Orbison later reflected, "I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time."<ref name="Amburn"/>{{refpage|p7}}

}}'''Enos William McDonald''' (October 1, 1915&ndash;March 31, 1968), better known as '''Skeets McDonald''',  was an American [[country music|country]] and [[rockabilly]] musician popular during the 1950s and 60s. Best known for the Slim Willet-penned song "[[Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes]]", McDonald was a devoted [[honky tonk]] singer and songwriter whose work helped to bridge the gap between country and [[rock and roll]].

==Biography==

McDonald was born on October 1, 1915, in [[Greenway, Arkansas]]. He was the youngest of his parents' seven children; his gained his nickname for calling mosquitoes "skeets" as a child.  When his older brother moved to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the early 1930s, McDonald followed; and joined his first band, the Lonesome Cowboys, in 1935. He later formed his own band and played local clubs and on radio in Flint and Pontiac.<ref name="SkeetsMcDonald">{{cite web | url = http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Skeets-McDonald.html  | title = Skeets McDonald | publisher = Oldies.com | access-date = 2009-04-11}}</ref>

McDonald was drafted in 1943 and was stationed in North Africa and the Far East during World War II, earning a [[Bronze Star]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Charles K.|last=Wolfe|title=Classic Country: Legends of Country Music|year=2001}}</ref> On discharge, he returned to radio and television work in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. He made his first recordings for [[Fortune Records]] in 1950 with Johnnie White and his Rough Riders, and cut records for [[London Records|London]] and [[Mercury Records]] as Skeets Saunders.

In 1951, McDonald moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], where he became a regular on [[Cliffie Stone]]'s ''[[Hometown Jamboree]]'' and later appeared on ''[[Town Hall Party]]''. He was soon signed by [[Capitol Records]], which viewed him as its answer to [[Columbia Records]]' [[Lefty Frizzell]] and demanded he continue releasing country songs rather than the rockabilly sound he experimented with since the war.<ref name="SkeetsMcDonald" /> He recorded more than 80 numbers for the label, including his 1952 smash country hit, "Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes" (No. 1 for 18 weeks).<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1722/biography|pure_url=yes}} Skeets McDonald Biography], [[Allmusic]]</ref> In the late 1950s, he appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' and continued recording for Capitol; his last release for the label was the album, ''The Country's Best''.

McDonald signed with Columbia in 1959 and spent the decade there, recording some excellent West Coast hillbilly, as well as some forays into the rockabilly. He employed young guitar-whiz [[Eddie Cochran]] to back him in the studio for "You Oughta See Grandma Rock" and "Heart Breaking Mama". Although they made little impact on the charts at the time, they are now considered rockabilly classics.<ref name="SkeetsMcDonald" />

He scored several hits on the ''Billboard'' country chart, including "This Old Heart" (1960, No. 21), "Call Me Mr. Brown" (1963, No. 9), "Big Chief Buffalo Nickel (Desert Blues)" (1966, No. 29), and "Mabel" (1967, No. 28).<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1722/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard Singles], Allmusic.com</ref> He also appeared on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and the ''[[Big D Jamboree]]'' in [[Dallas, Texas]]. His songs included "I'll Make Believe", "Big Family Trouble", "I Need Your Love" and "The Echo of Your Footsteps". In 1964, he released the album Call ''Me Skeets!''.

McDonald made several film appearances, including ''Saddle Pals'' with [[Johnny Mack Brown]], ''[[Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town]]'' (1950), ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954) and ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'' (1963),<ref name="SkeetsMcDonald" /> singing "Driftwood on the River" with Janet McBride.

In later years, McDonald moved his style more towards rock and roll; but refused to move far from the tearjerking songs which made his name. When told by reviewers he "belonged to another age," he took it as a compliment to his dedication.<ref name="SkeetsMcDonald" />

McDonald died from a heart attack on March 31, 1968, in Los Angeles.

'''Jiles Perry''' "'''J.P.'''" '''Richardson Jr.''' (October 24, 1930 – February 3, 1959), better known by his stage name '''The Big Bopper''', was an American musician and disc jockey. His best-known compositions include "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]," "[[Running Bear]]", and "[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]", the latter of which became [[George Jones]]'s first number-one hit in 1959. 

Richardson was [[The Day the Music Died|killed in an airplane crash]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], in February 1959, along with fellow musicians [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], and the pilot, Roger Peterson.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|title = 1959: Buddy Holly killed in air crash|publisher = BBC|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/3/newsid_2802000/2802541.stm|work = On This Day|accessdate = November 2, 2008 | date=February 3, 1959 | location=London}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Richardson was born on October 24, 1930, in [[Sabine Pass, Texas]], the oldest son of oil-field worker Jiles Perry Richardson (1905–84) and his wife Elise (née Stalsby) Richardson (1909–83). They had two other sons, Cecil (1934–89) and James (1932–2010). The family soon moved to [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Richardson graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and played on the "Royal Purple" American football team as a defensive lineman, wearing number 85.<ref>''Big Bopper: From Head Waiter To Rock'N'Roll Hero''. T Knight – Goldmine, 1989</ref> Richardson later was a radio [[disc jockey]] while at [[Lamar University|Lamar College]],<ref name=b&m /> where he studied prelaw and was a member of the band and chorus.

== Career ==
=== Radio ===
Richardson worked part-time at [[Beaumont, Texas]] radio station KTRM (now [[KZZB]]). He was hired by the station full-time in 1949 and quit college. Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou on April 18, 1952, and their daughter Debra Joy was born in December 1953, soon after Richardson was promoted to supervisor of announcers at KTRM. In March 1955, he was [[conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] and did his basic training at [[Fort Ord]], California. Richardson spent the rest of his two-year service as a radar instructor at [[Fort Bliss]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In March 1957, following his discharge as a corporal, Richardson returned to KTRM radio, where he held down the "Dishwashers' Serenade" shift from 11&nbsp;a.m. to 12:30&nbsp;p.m., Monday to Friday.

One of the station's sponsors wanted Richardson for a new time slot, and suggested an idea for a show. Richardson had seen college students doing a dance called The Bop, and he decided to call himself "The Big Bopper". His new radio show ran from 3:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m., and he soon became the station's program director. In May 1957, Richardson broke the record for continuous on-air broadcasting by eight minutes. He performed for a total of five days, two hours, and eight minutes from a remote setup in the lobby of the [[Jefferson Theatre]] in downtown Beaumont, playing 1,821 records<ref name=accuracy /> and taking showers during five-minute newscasts.<ref name="b&m">[https://www.bopperandme.co.uk/petition.php] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> Richardson is credited for creating the first music video in 1958, and recorded an early example himself.<ref name=accuracy>{{cite web|url=https://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Richardson,J.P.TheBigBopper.html|title=J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson|website=Accuracyproject.org|accessdate=January 21, 2007}}</ref>

=== Singer and songwriter ===
[[File:Big Bopper's Wedding - Little Red Riding Hood ad - Cash Box 1958.jpg|thumb|Advertisement featured in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine, 13 December 1958]] 
Richardson, who played guitar, began his musical career as a songwriter. [[George Jones]] later recorded Richardson's "[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]", which became Jones's first No. 1 country hit in 1959 (#73 on the pop charts). Richardson also wrote "[[Running Bear]]" for [[Johnny Preston]], his friend from [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. The inspiration for the song came from Richardson's childhood memory of the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]], where he heard stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes. Preston's recording was not released until August 1959, six months after Richardson's death. The song became a No. 1 hit for three weeks in January 1960. The man who launched Richardson as a recording artist was [[Pappy Daily|Harold "Pappy" Daily]] from [[Houston]]. Daily was promotion director for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] and [[Starday Records]] and signed Richardson to Mercury. Richardson's first single, "Beggar to a King", had a country flavor, but failed to gain any chart action.

Richardson soon cut "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" as "The Big Bopper"<ref name=pc14>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19763/m1/ |title= Show 14 – Big Rock Candy Mountain: Rock 'n' roll in the late fifties |show=14}}</ref> for Pappy Daily's [[D (record label)|D label]]. Mercury bought the recording and released it at the end of June 1958. It slowly began picking up airplay through July and August, and reached No. 6 on the pop chart spending 22 weeks in the national Top 40.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/98 98]|isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/98}}</ref> The disc sold in excess of one million copies by the end of 1958 and was awarded a [[music recording certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> In "Chantilly Lace", Richardson pretends to have a flirting phone conversation with his girlfriend;<ref name=pc14 /> the record was comical in nature, with The Big Bopper presenting an exaggerated, but good-natured caricature of a ladies' man. In November 1958, he scored a second hit, a raucous novelty tune entitled "The Big Bopper's Wedding", in which Richardson pretends to be getting [[cold feet]] at the altar. Both "Chantilly Lace" and "Big Bopper's Wedding" were receiving top 40 radio airplay through January 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=27496|title=ARSA – The Radio Surveys / Record Charts Site|first=Tim|last=Warden|website=Las-solanas.com|accessdate=February 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227231640/http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=27496|archive-date=February 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=13459|title=ARSA – The Radio Surveys / Record Charts Site|first=Tim|last=Warden|website=Las-solanas.com|accessdate=February 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227231704/http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=13459|archive-date=February 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Richardson was married to Adrianne Joy "Teetsie" Richardson Wenner (1936–2004) and had a daughter, Debra (1953–2006). His son, Jay Perry Richardson, was born two months after his death, in April 1959. Richardson had been building a recording studio in his home in [[Beaumont, Texas]], and was planning to invest in a radio station. Richardson had written 20 new songs that he planned to record himself or with other artists. His son also followed a musical career and was known professionally as "The Big Bopper, Jr.", performing around the world. He toured on the "Winter Dance Party" tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller on some of the same stages where his father had performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In January 2007, Jay Richardson requested that his father's body be exhumed and an autopsy be performed in response to an internet rumor about guns being fired aboard the aircraft and Richardson initially surviving the crash.<ref>{{cite news|title=Autopsy of 'Big Bopper' to Address Rumors About 1959 Plane Crash|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701976.html|website=Washingtonpost.com|date=January 18, 2007}}</ref> The autopsy was performed by [[William M. Bass]], a forensic anthropologist at the [[University of Tennessee]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. Richardson was present throughout the autopsy and observed the casket as it was opened; both men were surprised that the remains were well enough preserved to be recognized as those of the late rock star. "Dad still amazes me 48 years after his death, that he was in remarkable shape," Richardson told the Associated Press. "I surprised myself. I handled it better than I thought I would."<ref name="Rumors" /> Bass's findings indicated no signs of foul play. "There are fractures from head to toe. Massive fractures…. [Richardson] died immediately. He didn't crawl away. He didn't walk away from the plane."<ref name="Rumors">[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070307/ap_en_mu/big_bopper_autopsy;_ylt=AiuEThYrYavV4isgGgMkAfEDW7oF] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Richardson's body was placed in a new casket made by the same company as the original and was reburied next to his wife in Beaumont's Forest Lawn Cemetery. Jay Richardson allowed the old casket to be displayed at the [[Texas Musicians Museum]].

== Death ==
{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2024}}[[File:Surf Ballroom Monument.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument in front of Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa]]

With the success of "Chantilly Lace", Richardson took time off from KTRM radio and joined [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and [[Dion and the Belmonts]] for a "[[Winter Dance Party]]" tour starting on January 23, 1959. On the 11th night of the tour (February 2, 1959), they played at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]]. That night, Holly chartered an airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]], intending to fly himself and his bandmates [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Tommy Allsup]] to their next tour venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. The musicians had been traveling by bus for over a week, and it had already broken down twice. They were tired, they had not been paid yet, and all of their clothes were dirty. The chartered flight would allow them to avoid another arduous bus ride, arrive early before the Moorhead show, do their laundry, and get some rest. Local pilot [[Roger Peterson (pilot)|Roger Peterson]] of Dwyer Flying Service (age 21) had agreed to take them. The weather forecast for the Clear Lake area was {{convert|18|°F|°C|abbr=on}} that night with moderate gusty winds and light scattered snow, and Peterson was fatigued from a 17-hour workday, but he agreed to fly the trip.

[[Frankie Sardo]] went to meet the crowd while Holly went into one of the dressing rooms at the Surf Ballroom where he notified Allsup and Jennings that he had chartered a plane to take them to [[Fargo, North Dakota]] (which is directly adjacent to Moorhead, Minnesota). On a friendly wager, Valens flipped a coin with Allsup for his seat on the plane—and won. Meanwhile, J.P. Richardson was suffering from the flu and was complaining that the bus was too cold and uncomfortable for him, so Jennings voluntarily surrendered his seat. Upon hearing that his bandmates had given away their plane seats, Holly joked, "Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up again." Jennings jokingly replied, "Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-how-waylon-jennings-survived-the-day-the-music-died-122992/ |title=Flashback: How Waylon Jennings Survived Buddy Holly Crash |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 3, 2015 }}</ref>

The Clear Lake show ended at around midnight and Holly, Valens, and Richardson drove to the Mason City Airport, loaded their luggage and boarded the red and white single-engine [[Beechcraft Bonanza]]. Peterson received clearance from the control tower around 12:55&nbsp;a.m. on February 3, 1959, and they took off—but the plane remained airborne for only a few minutes. It crashed at full throttle shortly after takeoff about 5 miles outside Mason City in the middle of farm country. The reason remains unknown but Peterson may have lost his visual reference and thought that he was ascending while he was actually descending. The right wingtip of the Bonanza hit the frozen ground and sent the aircraft cartwheeling across a cleared cornfield at approximately {{convert|170|mph}}.

Holly, Valens and Richardson were thrown from the airplane on impact and likely tumbled along with the wreckage across the icy field before the wreckage of the aircraft came to rest against a barbed-wire fence, while Peterson's body remained entangled in the wreckage. The bodies of Holly and Valens came to rest several feet away from the wreckage on open ground; Richardson was thrown approximately {{convert|100|feet}} beyond the wreckage across the fence line and into the next cornfield. All three died instantly of head and chest injuries. Richardson was 28 years old.

[[File:HollyMonument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument at crash site, September 16, 2003]]
In 1988, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s era, erected a stainless steel monument at the crash site depicting a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers. It is located on private farmland, about one-quarter-mile west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, about eight miles north of Clear Lake. Paquette also created a similar stainless steel monument to the three near the Riverside Ballroom in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. The memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jordan |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.articlestree.com/music/the-day-the-music-died-tx390707.html |title=The Day the Music Died |website=Articlestree.com |date=April 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207001836/http://www.articlestree.com/music/the-day-the-music-died-tx390707.html |archive-date=February 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

J.P. Richardson's pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. The Big Bopper is fondly remembered not only for his distinctive singing and songwriting, but also as a humorist who combined the best elements of country, R&B, and rock 'n' roll.

In 2010, Richardson was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |title=Big Bopper &#124; iowarocknroll |access-date=November 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627120647/https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Richardson's name is mentioned as one of the upcoming musical acts in both the print and television versions of [[Stephen King]]'s short story "[[You Know They Got a Hell of a Band]]" about a town inhabited by late musical legends. Buddy Holly is subsequently featured in the story.

The Canadian television comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' featured a character named "Sue Bopper-Simpson", a fictional daughter of the Big Bopper, played by [[Catherine O'Hara]]. The character was a part-time real estate agent who appeared in a musical titled ''I'm Taking My Own Head, Screwing It on Right, and No Guy's Gonna Tell Me That It Ain't''.

Shortly after the fatal plane crash, Tommy Dee wrote and recorded a song titled "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]" in tribute to Richardson, Holly, and Valens. It was later recorded by [[Eddie Cochran]], a friend of the three musicians who himself would die prematurely a year later in an automobile crash.

The accident was referred to as "[[The Day the Music Died]]" in [[Don McLean]]'s 1971 song "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]".<ref name="Thimou">{{cite web|last=Thimou |first=Theodore |title=Preview: The Twice-Famous Don McLean Plays Rams Head |work=Bay Weekly |date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.bayweekly.com/musicscene.html |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613224425/http://www.bayweekly.com/musicscene.html |archive-date=June 13, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Van Halen]]'s song "Good Enough" from their 1986 album ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' begins with singer [[Sammy Hagar]] calling out "Hello Baby!", imitating the Big Bopper's hook in "Chantilly Lace". [[Phil Lewis (musician)|Phil Lewis]] of [[L.A. Guns]] does the same in their song "17 Crash" from their 1989 album ''[[Cocked & Loaded]]''.

The ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]" features a gravestone of The Big Bopper in Springfield that [[Sideshow Bob]] ([[Kelsey Grammer]]) used to help commit [[voter fraud]] and become elected for mayor. The gravestone is a bust of the Big Bopper holding a telephone receiver, with the epitaph reading "The Big Bopper", his birth and death years (1930–1959), then a parody on the memorable hook reading "Gooooodbye, baby". He also appeared as a vampire holding a telephone in an ''Itchy and Scratchy'' cartoon during the episode "[[C.E.D'oh]]".

An episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'' entitled "[[Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose]]" alludes to the deaths of [[Buddy Holly]] and the Big Bopper. The episode's title character, played by [[Peter Boyle]], explains that he had a ticket to see them perform the night after they died and received the psychic ability to predict people's deaths by calculating the odds that it took for the Big Bopper to be on the flight that killed him.

The Big Bopper's estate is currently owned by his daughter-in-law, Patty Richardson, and managed by [[C3 Entertainment]], a company that specializes in classic brands. C3 Entertainment currently manages an official [[tribute band]] featuring a Big Bopper impersonator, touring with the Winter Dance Party.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 2019, the Winter Dance Party debuted the film ''Bopper and Me.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://globegazette.com/entertainment/local_entertainment/the-big-bopper-documentary-premieres-in-clear-lake-this-weekend/article_36e993c1-89ff-5409-bb74-c9b5e0783138.html |title='The Big Bopper' documentary premieres in Clear Lake this weekend (with photos) &#124; Local Entertainment |website=Globegazette.com |date=January 30, 2019 |accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref>

'''The Blue Moon Boys''' were an American [[rock and roll]] band that was formed by [[Elvis Presley]], lead [[guitar]]ist [[Scotty Moore]] and [[double bass]] player [[Bill Black]]. The group members were introduced by [[Sun Studio]] owner [[Sam Phillips]] in 1954, except for drummer [[D.J. Fontana]], who joined the group during a [[Louisiana Hayride]] tour in 1955. The Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2007. The band was named after [[Bill Monroe|Bill Monroe's]] song "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".

== Background ==
On July 18, 1953, [[Elvis Presley]] recorded a single at  [[Sun Studio]] as a gift for his [[Gladys Presley|mother]]'s birthday, the [[Ink Spots]]' "My Happiness", with "That's When Your Heartaches Begin" on the flipside.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| title=Where did Elvis Presley start his career?| publisher=elvislovemetender.com| access-date=2010-10-04| archive-date=2011-07-10| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710184750/http://www.elvislovemetender.com/presley/where-did-elvis-presley-start-his-career| url-status=dead}}</ref>
Studio owner [[Sam Phillips]] was not there, so Presley's recording was managed by his secretary, [[Marion Keisker]], who kept a demo copy of the recording.<ref>Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-33225-9}}. Retrieved 2010-09-27.</ref>

At Phillips' behest Keisker called Presley for an appointment at the studio almost a year later; he returned on June 26, 1954.<ref name=Historyofrock>{{cite web | url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/sam_phillips_sun_records_two.htm| title=Sam Phillips' Sun Records| publisher=history-of-rock.com|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref> Although most of the session was not recorded, Phillips was impressed by Presley and introduced him to the [[country music]] band [[Starlight Wranglers]]' guitarist [[Scotty Moore]], who later introduced Presley to double bass player [[Bill Black]].<ref name=Hillbilly>{{cite web| url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| title=Elvis Aaron Presley 1953-1955: The Hillbilly Cat.| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au| access-date=2010-09-27| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921184326/http://elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1953_1955.html| archive-date=2010-09-21}}</ref>

== Sun recordings ==
On July 5, 1954, the trio headed to the Sun Studios for a recording test together. They recorded the songs "Harbor Lights" and "[[I Love You Because]]", and during a break they performed an impromptu version of [[Arthur Crudup]]'s "[[That's All Right]]", which impressed Phillips, who asked for a refinement of the interpretation that later was recorded.<ref name=Historyofrock/> 
Phillips played the recording for [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]]'s [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Dewey Phillips]], who played the song on his regular show next night, on July 8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lyrics.elvispresley.com.au/lyrics/thats_all_right_mama.html| title=That's Alright| publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|access-date = 2010-10-04}}</ref>
On July 9, the trio recorded what became the flipside to "That's All Right", an uptempo [[rockabilly]] version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/show_pic.php?key=3318&type=ls | title=Rockin' Country Style| publisher=rcs-discography.com|access-date = 2010-09-27}}</ref>

'''The Boxmasters''' is an American rock band founded in [[Bellflower, California]], in 2007 by actor [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and Grammy Award-winning recording engineer J.D. Andrew. The group has released thirteen albums, with another one being released on May 5, 2023

Before he formed the Boxmasters, frontman [[Billy Bob Thornton|Thornton]] had played in bands since middle school, worked as a [[roadie]], recorded in 1974 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and in the 2000s released four solo albums. After listening to "[[Yesterday's Gone (song)|Yesterday's Gone]]" by [[Chad & Jeremy]] and thinking about [[cover (music)|covering]] it in a [[Old-time music|hillbilly music]] [[music style|style]], he had the idea of making Americanized version of [[British Invasion]] [[pop music|pop songs]]. From mid-2008 to late 2008, the group embarked on a tour across the United States, ending in [[Los Angeles]]. It also played for the March 2009 [[South by Southwest]] conference. After opening several tours for Willie Nelson in 2009 & 2010, The Boxmasters ceased touring for five years, which they used to write multiple albums and emerged with a more natural sound, as opposed to their early hillbilly leanings.

==History==
=== Beginnings ===
[[Billy Bob Thornton]]—credited on the band's material as W. R. Thornton—has said that "[he] never intended to become a movie star, it happened accidentally. [...] Music is what I love."<ref name=style/> Before his acting career started, he played in [[cover band]]s of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[ZZ Top]], and also worked as a [[roadie]] with [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Johnny Paycheck]], [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], the [[Statler Brothers]], and other bands during high school.<ref name=cross/><ref name=return>{{cite news|url=http://www.spinner.com/2008/06/02/billy-bob-thornton-returns-to-music-with-the-boxmasters/|title=Billy Bob Thornton Returns to Music With the Boxmasters|first=David |last=Chiu|work=[[Spinner.com]]|date=June 2, 2008|access-date=August 28, 2009}}</ref> He also released a record with a band called 'Hot Lanta' in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beal Jr.|first=Jim|date=July 17, 2008|title=Billy Bob's band is all about 'modbilly'|work=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Newspapers]]|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music/Billy_Bobs_band_is_all_about_modbilly.html |access-date=August 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108005121/http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music/Billy_Bobs_band_is_all_about_modbilly.html|archive-date=January 8, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his acting career, Thornton released four solo albums from 2001 to 2007.<ref name=mod>{{cite web|url=http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/ent-life/billy_bob_and_the_boxmasters_bring_modbilly_to_beaumont_friday_03-19-2009.html|title=Billy Bob and the Boxmasters bring modbilly to Beaumont Friday|work=Beaumont Enterprise|date=March 19, 2009}}</ref>

Thornton brought in [[sound engineer]] J. D. Andrew to help with his 2007 album ''[[Beautiful Door]]''. After [[Jam session|jamming]] together, they started to record some of their material. Andrew had known Mike Butler "for six or seven years" and called on him to play guitar for them. According to Andrew, after the trio played together, they said "Shoot, this sounds like a band." The three came up with the name "Boxmasters" after a piece of [[Southern American English|Southern slang]], which they later described by saying "remember the bad boy in high school who got all the girls and left a trail of broken hearts ... and more?"<ref name=mod/> Thornton had also briefly played in [[country music|country]] star [[Porter Wagoner]]'s similarly titled band 'The Wagonmasters', which he later said had brought chills down his spine.<ref name=cross>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908011946/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1594027/billy-bob-thornton-crosses-musical-boundaries-with-boxmasters.jhtml Billy Bob Thornton Crosses Musical Boundaries With Boxmasters].

===Early career===
The band started in [[Bellflower, California]], in 2007. During its early days, the band played several live shows in the [[California]] area, as well as in [[Tecate, Mexico]].<ref name=style/><ref name=all>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1056524/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Boxmasters|work= [[Allmusic]]|access-date= April 12, 2009|last= True|first=Chris}}</ref> Their first album, ''The Boxmasters'', was released on June 10, 2008, by [[Vanguard Records]]. It received a mostly poor review from [[Allmusic]], which stated that "The Boxmasters might work live because there will be visuals; but merely as a listening exercise, it's best taken in small doses so the novelty doesn't wear off." The review also alleged that "Thornton can't drum to save his life, and he can't sing".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1385031|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Boxmasters – The Boxmasters|work= [[Allmusic]]|access-date= April 12, 2009|last= Jurek|first=Thom}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the album, and the paper remarked that listeners will get their money's worth if they enjoy the music even half as much as the band did during the recordings.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Mike|last=Joyce|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Boxmasters|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/21/AR2008082101011.html|access-date=August 25, 2009}}</ref>

The group resumed [[tour (music)|touring]] in July 2008,<ref name=return/> adding musicians Bradley Davis on [[mandolin]], [[guitar]], and [[vocalist|vocals]], [[Teddy Andreadis]] on [[harmonica]] and [[organ (music)|organ]], and Mike Bruce on [[drums]].<ref name=all/> Their tour across the United States ended on September 7, 2008, when they played at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=cross/> The band released their second album, ''Christmas Cheer'', on November 11, 2008, also through [[Vanguard Records]]. [[Allmusic]] gave another critical review, calling the music "an acquired taste".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1440523|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Boxmasters – Christmas Cheer|work= [[Allmusic]]|access-date= April 12, 2009|last= Jurek|first=Thom}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' music critic [[Brian Mansfield]] named it one of his favorite holiday albums.<ref>{{cite news|title=A very special Christmas list for fans of all musical genres|work=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2008-12-14-christmas-music-list_N.htm|date=December 15, 2008|first=Brian|last=Mansfield|access-date=August 25, 2009}}</ref> The Boxmasters went on a post-album 12-city tour with [[Willie Nelson]], playing from November 22 in [[Enid, Oklahoma]], to December 6 in [[Champaign, Illinois]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081228051608/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1599397/boxmasters-to-tour-with-willie-nelson.jhtml Boxmasters to Tour with Willie Nelson].

The band released ''Modbilly'' on Vanguard on April 21, 2009. ''[[Houston Press]]'' praised the album, saying that it "confirms that Billy Bob Thornton's writing talents aren't confined to his [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[screenplay]]s."<ref>[http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2009/04/listening_room_whats_been_tick.php Listening Room: What's Been Tickling Our Earholes Lately].

The group has [[Cover version|covered]] [[The Beatles]], [[The Who]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Turtles]], and [[Mott the Hoople]] in its unique style. It also plays original songs, mostly written or co-written by Thornton based on the "[[white trash]]" figures he had seen in his [[Arkansas]] [[Billy Bob Thornton#Early life|childhood]]. ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'' has called his original material "at turns dark and funny, with world-class hooks".<ref name=style/> The members play while wearing well-dressed '[[Mod (subculture)#Fashion|Mod]]' outfits such as [[tailor]]ed black [[Suit (clothing)|suits]], white shirts, and narrow black [[necktie]]s.<ref name=sour/>

Aside from playing, Thornton has said that he plans on creating [[comic books]] based on him and other band members. Plots would involve the band coming to the aid of townspeople as they tour. He said, "We're not sure what our superpowers are going to be yet".<ref>[http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/billy-bob-thornton-becomes-a-boxmaster-158289 Billy Bob Thornton becomes a Boxmaster].

===Canadian touring and controversy===
In April 2009, the band was scheduled to tour across Canada, [[opening act|opening]] for [[country music]] veterans [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]].<ref name=style>{{cite news|url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=5cc62424-fb2e-4f80-a582-394f7d4db73b|work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|date=April 7, 2009|last=Perusse|first= Bernard|access-date=August 25, 2009|title=Beatles and Rolling Stones, hillbilly style}}</ref><ref name=sour/> On April 8, the band appeared on the national [[CBC Radio One]] program ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', hosted by [[Jian Ghomeshi]]. During the first half of the interview, Thornton was "surly and uncooperative", and responded with "I don't know" when asked how long the band had been together. When asked about his musical tastes and influences as a child, he gave his longest answer, but it was about his favorite magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''. He also stated that he had "instructed" the show's producers to not ask any questions about his career as a screenwriter and actor.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2009/04/09/Thornton-obnoxious-in-CBC-interview/UPI-76871239285658/ Thornton obnoxious in CBC interview].

Retrieved August 28, 2009.</ref> The interview is satirized in the Detective Crashmore sketch in Season 2, Episode 3 of [[I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson#Season 2 (2021)|I Think You Should Leave]].

Ghomeshi, in introducing the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton went on to say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other. He then added, "it's like [[mashed potato]]es with no [[gravy]]." This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.<ref name=times>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6067668.ece Billy Bob Thornton does a Joaquin Phoenix on Canadian radio].

A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid-set, with people in the audience yelling "here comes the gravy!" when Thornton tried to explain he liked Canadians but not the CBC radio host. Before the show, when asked about his "gravy" comment, Thornton claimed he was talking about the radio host.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/616601 Billy Bob not done with the barbs].

===Touring hiatus===
In 2010, The Boxmasters ceased touring for almost five years.  During that time [[Billy Bob Thornton]] wrote & directed the feature film ''[[Jayne Mansfield's Car]]''.

===Return to album releases and touring===
In 2015 the Boxmasters returned with the album ''Somewhere Down The Road'' released by 101 Ranch Records.  Rolling Stone said "This sprawling double album, which amazingly doesn't feel ''Use Your Illusion'' bloated, finds him and the ace 'Masters — who play the Grand Ole Opry on August 18th — mixing country noir with bright jangle pop. One disc is all Americana gothic, while the other is ''Nuggets'' by way of Liverpool. "Always Lie," from the twangy half of the project, is Thornton devilishly sharing his trick for dealing with the press and ranks with some of country's most honest songwriting. (Or does it?)"<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/30-great-country-albums-of-2015-you-probably-didnt-hear-20150806/the-boxmasters-somewhere-down-the-road-20150806|title=30 Great Country Albums of 2015 You Probably Didn't Hear|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=6 August 2015 |access-date=June 27, 2018}}</ref>

'''The Buckaroos''' were an American band led by [[Buck Owens]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who, along with [[Merle Haggard]]'s [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]], were involved in the development and presentation of the "[[Bakersfield sound]]." Their peak of success was from 1965 to 1970. In 2005, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] named the Buckaroos No. 2 on its list of the 20 Greatest Country Music Bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/90579/episode_countdown.jhtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120724144840/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/90579/episode_countdown.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 24, 2012 |title=TV Shows : Watch Full Episodes Online : Featured Shows, Schedules and Top 20 Video Countdown |website=Cmt.com |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref>

==History==
[[Don Rich]], [[Doyle Holly]], [[Tom Brumley]] and [[Willie Cantu]] were the original members of the Buckaroos during the 1960s. The 1970s version included Don Rich, Jerry Wiggins, [[Jerry Brightman]], Doyle Curtsinger, and Jim Shaw. Various [[Sideman|sidemen]] throughout the years included [[JayDee Maness]]<!--not "Jay Dee"-->, Wayne "Moose" Stone, Jay McDonald, Ken Presley, and very early on, [[Merle Haggard]]. Haggard, who worked a short time with Owens in 1962, suggested the group's name.<ref>"Merle Haggard: The Real Deal". ''Biography''. A&E TV. November 15, 2000.</ref> Fiddle player [[Jana Jae]] became the group's first female member after being invited onstage with Buck Owens to play "[[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]]". Vocalist Victoria Hallman (a.k.a. Jesse Rose McQueen) toured with the Buckaroos, sang with them on Hee Haw and recorded one Buck Owens record "Let Jesse Rob the Train" with the group.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Drummer/singer Rick Taylor replaced Jerry Wiggins in 1978, when he left the band to manage his wife, Susan Raye. Rick performed his first appearance at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas "winging it" as there was no time for rehearsals before the sold-out performances. Rick had seen Buck and the original Buckaroos live in Omaha when he was 13 years old and dreamed of performing with Buck on Hee Haw. At age 19 he made his way to Nashville and 5 years later, he was performing in a rock cover group at a Nashville night club when Buck himself came to watch him at the urging of Hee Haw music director, Charlie McCoy, and Hee Haw staff band players, [[Leon Rhodes]], and Tommy Williams. Buck hired Rick on the spot and invited him to the Hee Haw set the next day where his dream became a reality. Rick's first taping was the Hee Haw 10th Anniversary Show taped at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tn in October 1978. He was with the Buckaroos until leaving in 1981, following the band's nomination and win as "Touring Band of the Year" at the ACM Awards, to join the Epic Records vocal group Nightstreets, voted Billboard Magazine's Vocal Group of the Year 1981 for the single, "Love In The Meantime". Nightstreets featured female vocalist, Joyce Hawthorne, met Rick while recording as a background singer with the Buckaroos in the 1970s. Nightstreets toured with George Jones and Tammy Wynette from 1981 through 1982. Rick retired from the music industry in 1986.

Known for their signature red, white and blue colored guitars and fiddles, the Buckaroos in 1966 became only the second country music band to appear at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]]. The recording of this performance, released as ''[[Carnegie Hall Concert (Buck Owens album)|Carnegie Hall Concert]]'', is considered one of the greatest live country music albums. They also recorded and released live albums from appearances in [[London]], [[Norway]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  The Buckaroos also appeared on the Buck Owens Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buckaroo.xyz/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025259/https://www.buckaroo.xyz/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-03-04 |title=Home |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>

The Buckaroos recorded eight albums from 1967 to 1970, all of which were top sellers. They also earned numerous awards, including [[Grammy]]s. They were nominated as "Band Of The Year" by the [[Academy of Country Music]] in eight consecutive years, winning the award four times, 1965–1968. The Buckaroos were also nominated as "Instrumental Group of the Year" in the Country Music Awards for five consecutive years, 1967–1971, winning the honor in 1967 and 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/database/ArtistDetail.aspx?artistId=764 |title=Homepage - 2016 CMA Awards |website=Cmaawards.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref>

In 1970, [[Doyle Holly]] received "Bass Player of the Year" award from the [[Academy of Country Music]] as a member of the Buckaroos. He left the group the next year to pursue a solo career, in which he released two Top 20 hit albums. He is honored in the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] and received a block in the walkway of stars at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1980. Holly died in 2007.<ref name="cst">{{cite web|last =Johnson| first =Jon| title =Doyle Holly and the Buckaroos are together again| work =CountryStandardTime.com| publisher =Jeffrey Remz|date=June 2003|url =http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?fn=doyleholly.asp|accessdate =2008-10-16}}</ref>

[[Tom Brumley]] left the Buckaroos in 1969 to join [[Ricky Nelson]]'s band, where he was a member for over a decade. His performance on "Together Again" has been considered "one of the finest steel guitar solos in the history of country music."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205003031/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1604311/tom-brumley-member-of-buck-owens-buckaroos-dies-in-texas.jhtml "Tom Brumley, Member of Buck Owens' Buckaroos, Dies in Texas"], ''[[Country Music Television]]'', February 4, 2009.

Accessed February 5, 2009.</ref>

[[Don Rich]] died in a motorcycle accident in 1974. At the time Rich was the only original member still with the Buckaroos and the band was struggling to find their way back at the top of the Country Music Charts. His death marked the end of the Buckaroos reign as the top Country Music band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck23.html |title=Home - Buck Owens Crystal PalaceBuck Owens' Crystal Palace |website=Buckowens.com |accessdate=2017-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231174118/http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck23.html |archivedate=2008-12-31 }}</ref>

[[Jerry Brightman]] left in 1975 and migrated into the business side with his involvement with [[WWVA Jamboree]] and [[Jamboree in the Hills]].

'''The Everly Brothers''' were an American [[rock music|rock]] duo, known for [[steel-string acoustic guitar]] playing and [[close harmony]] singing. Consisting of [[Don Everly|Isaac Donald "Don" Everly]] and [[Phil Everly|Phillip "Phil" Everly]], the duo combined elements of [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]], and [[pop music|pop]],<ref name="Unterberger">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-everly-brothers-mn0000046699/biography |title=The Everly Brothers |last=Unterberger |first=Richie   |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref> becoming pioneers of [[country rock]].<ref name=RecordCollector/><ref name=Hoffman/>

The duo was raised in a musical family, first appearing on radio in Iowa singing with their father Ike Everly and mother Margaret Everly as "The Everly Family" in the 1940s, and in Knoxville, Tennessee, while the brothers were in high school.  They gained the attention of [[Chet Atkins]], who began to promote them for national attention.

They began writing and recording their own music in 1956, and their first hit song came in 1957, with "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]," written by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]]. The song hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957, and additional hits would follow through 1958, many of them written by the Bryants, including "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]," "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]," and "[[Problems (The Everly Brothers song)|Problems]]." In 1960, they signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded "[[Cathy's Clown]]," written by the brothers themselves, which was their biggest selling single. The brothers enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in 1961 and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962, with "[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)]]" being their last top-10 hit.

Long-simmering disputes with [[Wesley Rose]], the CEO of [[Acuff-Rose Music]], which managed the group, and increased drug use in the 1960s, as well as changing tastes in popular music, led to the duo's decline in popularity in its native U.S., though the brothers continued to release hit singles in the U.K. and Canada and had many highly successful tours throughout the 1960s. In the early 1970s, the brothers began releasing solo recordings, and in 1973 they officially broke up. Starting in 1983, the brothers got back together and continued to perform periodically until Phil's death in 2014. Don died seven years later.

The group had a major influence on the music of the generation that followed it. Many of the top acts of the 1960s were heavily influenced by the close-harmony singing and acoustic guitar playing of the Everly Brothers including [[the Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]], the [[Bee Gees]], and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the Everly Brothers No. 1 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=December 17, 2015|title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/1-the-everly-brothers-239717/|access-date=September 6, 2020|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as part of the inaugural class of 1986 and into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2001. Don was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2019, earning the organization's first Iconic Riff Award for his distinctive rhythm guitar intro to the Everlys' massive 1957 hit "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/musicians-hall-of-fame-2019-inductees-alabama-don-everly-859832/ |title=Alabama, Don Everly Set for Musicians Hall of Fame |author=Stephen L.

Don was born in [[Brownie, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]], on February 1, 1937, and Phil in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on January 19, 1939. Their parents were Isaac Milford "Ike" Everly Jr. (1908–1975), a guitar player, and Margaret Embry Everly (1919–2021).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicrow.com/2021/12/margaret-everly-dies-at-age-102/|title=Margaret Everly Dies At Age 102|first=Robert K.|last=Oermann|date=December 17, 2021}}</ref><ref name="AMG">{{cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |title=Biography of the Everly Brothers |publisher=AllMusic Guide |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4208|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=September 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knoxnews.com/story/shopper-news/bearden/2019/02/21/everly-brothers-mother-99-recalls-bearden-cas-walker-chet-atkins/2879557002/|title=Everly Brothers' mother, 99, recalls Bearden, Cas Walker and the ducktails|first=John|last=Shearer|website=Knoxville News Sentinel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=November 21, 2019|title=Everly Brothers Childhood Home|url=https://www.facebook.com/everlybrotherschildhoodhome/posts/happy-100th-birthday-margaret-everly-joined-by-friends-and-fans-all-around-the-w/1538411049631429/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/355612454577967/1538411049631429 |archive-date=February 26, 2022|url-access=registration|access-date=August 23, 2021|website=[[Facebook]]|language=en}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Actor [[James Best]] (born Jewel Guy), also from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], was a first cousin, the son of Ike's sister.

While in Knoxville the brothers found work performing on [[Cas Walker]]’s Farm and Home Hour, a regional radio and TV variety program, before the brothers caught the attention of family friend [[Chet Atkins]], manager of the [[RCA Victor]] studios in Nashville.<ref>“Everly Brothers' mother, 99, recalls Bearden, Cas Walker and the ducktails,” Knoxville News Sentinel, February 21, 2019</ref> Shortly thereafter their mother moved the family to Nashville.<ref name="Lazell p. 171">Lazell, Barry ed., with Dafydd Rees and Luke Crampton, ''Rock Movers & Shakers''.

Atkins introduced the Everly Brothers to [[Wesley Rose]], of [[Acuff-Rose]] music publishers. Rose told them he would secure them a recording deal if they signed to Acuff-Rose as songwriters. They signed in late 1956, and in 1957 Rose introduced them to [[Archie Bleyer]],<ref>Alan Frazer, "The Everly Saga, $$."

Working with the Bryants, they had hits in the United States and the United Kingdom, the biggest being "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]", "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]", "[[Bird Dog (song)|Bird Dog]]", and "[[Problems (The Everly Brothers song)|Problems]]". The Everlys, though they were largely interpretive artists, also succeeded as songwriters, especially with Don's "[[(Till) I Kissed You]]", which hit No.&nbsp;4 on the US pop charts.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', Billboard Books, NY 1992, p. 165.</ref>

The brothers toured with [[Buddy Holly]] in 1957 and 1958. According to Holly's biographer Philip Norman, they were responsible for persuading Holly and the [[the Crickets|Crickets]] to change their outfits from [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] and [[T-shirt]]s to the Everlys' [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League]] suits. Don said Holly wrote and composed "Wishing" for them. "We were all from the South", Phil observed of their commonalities.

After three years on Cadence, the Everlys signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1960,<ref name="AMG" /> where they recorded for 10 years. Their first Warner Bros. hit, 1960's "[[Cathy's Clown]]", which they wrote and composed themselves, sold eight million copies and became the duo's biggest-selling record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077x1fh|title=The Everly Brothers: Harmonies from Heaven|website=BBC|access-date=September 11, 2021}}</ref> "Cathy's Clown" was number WB1, the first selection Warner Bros.

Other successful Warner Bros. singles followed in the United States, such as "[[So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)]]" (1960, pop No.&nbsp;7), "[[Walk Right Back]]" (1961, pop No.&nbsp;7), "[[Crying in the Rain]]" (1962, pop No.&nbsp;6), and "[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)|That's Old Fashioned]]" (1962, pop No.&nbsp;9, their last top 10 hit). From 1960 to 1962, Cadence Records released Everly Brothers singles from the vaults, including "[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]" (pop No.&nbsp;8), written and composed by Phil, and "[[Like Strangers]]".<ref name="ebmf">{{cite web|url=https://musicfinder.online/the-everly-brothers/|title=The Everly Brothers |website=Music Finder| date=September 10, 2014 |access-date=September 16, 2021}}</ref>

In the UK, they had 18 singles into the top 40 with Warner Bros. in the 1960s, including a string of top 10 hits through 1965 that featured "[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]"/"So Sad" (1960, No.&nbsp;4), "Walk Right Back"/"[[Ebony Eyes (John D. Loudermilk song)|Ebony Eyes]]" (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]" (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "Cryin' in the Rain" (1962, No.&nbsp;6) and "[[The Price of Love]]" (1965, No.&nbsp;2).

By 1962, records by the Everlys had reportedly generated $35 million in sales.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trigger|date=January 4, 2014|url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/how-music-row-acuff-rose-killed-the-everly-brothers/|title=How Music Row & Acuff-Rose Killed The Everly Brothers/|website=Saving Country Music.com|access-date=September 16, 2021}}</ref> In 1961, the brothers had a falling out with Wesley Rose during the recording of "Temptation". Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he had not published and, hence, for which he would not be paid any publishing royalties. Rose made efforts to block the record's release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s, they were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written and composed most of their hits, as well as the Everlys themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. From 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other composers to avoid paying any royalties to Acuff-Rose. They used the pseudonym "Jimmy Howard" as writer or arranger on two selections they wrote and recorded during this time. This ruse, however, was ultimately unsuccessful, as Acuff-Rose gained legal possession of the copyrights once the deception was discovered.<ref name="alca">{{cite web|url=https://alancackett.com/phil-everly/|title=Phil Everly|website=Alan Cackett |access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref>
Around this time, the brothers also set up their own record label, Calliope Records, for solo projects. Using the pseudonym "Adrian Kimberly", Don recorded a big-band instrumental version of [[Edward Elgar]]'s first "[[Pomp and Circumstance]]" march, which [[Neal Hefti]] arranged and which charted in the United States top 40 in mid-1961. Further instrumental singles credited to Kimberly followed, but none of those charted. Phil formed the Keestone Family Singers, which featured [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Carole King]]. Their lone single, "Melodrama", failed to chart, and by the end of 1962, Calliope Records had gone out of business.
The Everly Brothers' last United States top 10 hit was 1962's "That's Old Fashioned (That's The Way Love Should Be)", a song recorded but unreleased by [[The Chordettes]] and given to the brothers by their old mentor, Archie Bleyer.<ref name="ebmf"/>

In succeeding years the Everly Brothers sold fewer records in the United States. Their enlistments in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in October 1961 took them out of the spotlight.<ref>Natalie Best. "Rock 'n' Roll Marine Weds With Brother As Best Man". ''San Diego Union'', February 14, 1962, p.

Following their discharges from active duty, the Everlys resumed their career, but with little success in the United States. Of their 27 singles on Warner Bros. from 1963 through 1970, only three made the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and none peaked higher than No.&nbsp;31. Album sales were also down. The Everlys' first two albums for Warners (in 1960 and 1961) peaked at No.&nbsp;9 US, but after that, of a dozen more LPs for Warner Bros., only one made the top 200 – 1965's "[[Beat & Soul]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;141.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nysmusic.com/2021/08/23/don-everly-1937-2021/|last=O'Shea|first=Tim|date=August 23, 2021|title=Don Everly, 1937–2021|website=NYS Music|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-everly-brothers/chart-history/tlp/|title=Chart History: The Everly Brothers – Beat & Soul|magazine=Billboard|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref>

The Everlys' dispute with Acuff-Rose lasted until 1964, when they resumed writing and composing as well as working with the Bryants. By then, however, both of the brothers were addicted to [[amphetamine]]s. Don's condition was worse, as he was taking [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]]; his [[addiction]] lasted three years, until he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and was hospitalized for treatment.<ref name="RSEncyc">''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Simon & Schuster, 2001)</ref> The mainstream media did not report either brothers' addiction.

Though their U.S. stardom had begun to wane two years before the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, their appeal was still strong in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The Everlys remained successful in the United Kingdom and Canada for most of the 1960s, reaching the top 40 in the United Kingdom through 1968 and the top 10 in Canada as late as 1967. The 1966 album ''[[Two Yanks in England]]'' was recorded in England with [[the Hollies]], who also wrote many of the album's songs. The Everlys' final U.S. top 40 hit, "[[Bowling Green (song)|Bowling Green]]", was released in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-everly-brothers-don-everly-dies-at-84/|last1=Kim|last2=Bloom|first1=Michelle Hyun|first2=Madison|date=August 22, 2021|title=The Everly Brothers' Don Everly Dies at 84|website=Pitchfork|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref>

By the end of the 1960s, the brothers had returned to country rock, and their 1968 album, ''[[Roots (The Everly Brothers album)|Roots]]'', was hailed by some retrospective critics as "one of the finest early country-rock albums".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6937|pure_url=yes}}|title=Roots The Everly Brothers|publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref> However, by the end of the 1960s, the Everly Brothers had ceased to be hitmakers in either North America or the UK, and in 1970, following an unsuccessful live album (''The Everly Brothers Show''), their ten-year contract with Warner Bros. lapsed. They were the summer replacement hosts for [[Johnny Cash]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] television show in 1970; their variety program, ''Johnny Cash Presents the Everly Brothers'', featured [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>"Everly Brothers Return". Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'', July 5, 1970, p. 29E.</ref>

In 1970, Don released his first solo album, which was unsuccessful. The brothers resumed performing in 1971 and issued two albums for [[RCA Records]] in 1972 and 1973. [[Lindsey Buckingham]] joined and toured with them in 1972. The Everlys announced their final performance would take place on July 14, 1973, at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park]], California, but tensions between the two surfaced and Don told a reporter he was tired of being an Everly Brother.<ref>Marilyn and Hy Gardner, "Everly Brothers Too Close for Too Long".

===Solo years (1973–1983)===
Phil and Don pursued solo careers from 1973 to 1983. Don found some success on the US country charts in the mid- to late-1970s, in Nashville with his band, Dead Cowboys, and playing with [[Albert Lee]]. Don also performed solo at an annual country music festival in London in mid-1976. His appearance was well received, and he was given "thunderous applause", even though critics noted that the performance was uneven.<ref>Ed Blanche, "Everly Laid Back". Springfield (MA) Union, June 21, 1977, p. 26.</ref>

Phil recorded more frequently, but with no chart success until the 1980s. He wrote "Don't Say You Don't Love Me No More" for the 1978 [[Clint Eastwood]] comedy film ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'', which he performed as a duet with the film's co-star [[Sondra Locke]]. Phil also wrote "One Too Many Women In Your Life" for the 1980 sequel, ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', and played in the band which backed Locke.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/05/phil-everly|last=Sweeting|first=Adam|date=January 5, 2014|title=Phil Everly obituary – Half of the brilliant duo that transformed 1950s pop music|website=The Guardian|access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref>

===Reunion, subsequent activities (1983–2006)===
The brothers' reunion concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]] on September 23, 1983, which ended their ten-year-long solo careers, was initiated by Phil and Don alongside Terry Slater, with Wingfield as musical director. This concert was recorded for a live LP and video broadcast on cable television in mid-January 1984.<ref>"Cable Concert Appearance Reunites the Everly Brothers". Newark (NJ) Star-Ledger, January 6, 1984, p. 38.</ref> The brothers returned to the studio as a duo for the first time in over a decade, recording the album ''EB '84'', produced by [[Dave Edmunds]]. The lead single, "[[On the Wings of a Nightingale]]", written by [[Paul McCartney]], was a success (Top 10 adult contemporary)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/eb-84-mw0000189823/awards |title=EB 84 – The Everly Brothers &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 5, 2014}}</ref> and returned them to the US Hot 100 (for their last appearance) and the UK charts.

Their final charting single was 1986's "[[Born Yesterday (song)|Born Yesterday]]", from the album of the same name. They collaborated with other performers, mostly singing either backup vocals or duets, including additional vocals on the title track of [[Paul Simon]]'s 1986 album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]''. In 1990, Phil recorded a duet with Dutch singer [[René Shuman]]. "On Top of the World" was written and composed by Phil, who appeared in the music video they recorded in Los Angeles. The selection appeared on Shuman's album ''Set the Clock on Rock''. A 1981 live [[BBC]] recording of "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]", which featured Cliff Richard and Phil sharing vocals, was a UK Top 20 hit in 1994.<ref name="Sleeve notes from 'All I Have to Do Is Dream' single">{{cite AV media notes | title='All I Have to Do Is Dream' (single)| author=Cliff Richard with Phil Everly|date=1994| publisher=EMI| location=United Kingdom}}</ref>

As a tribute to the Everly Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel opened their own show and had the Everlys come out in the middle of it. The live album ''[[Old Friends: Live on Stage]]'' contains Simon & Garfunkel discussing the Everlys' influence on their career and features all four on "Bye Bye Love"; the subsequent DVD features two extra solo performances by the Everlys.

Don Everly claimed in a 2014 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that he had given up smoking in the late 1960s and that Phil had stopped too, but started again during their breakup and had continued until 2001. Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]]. He admitted that he had lived "a very difficult life" with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something that was mainly attributed to "their vastly different views on politics and life", with the music being the one thing they shared closely, saying, "it's almost like we could read each other's minds when we sang." However, Don also stated he had not gotten over Phil's death, saying, "I always thought about him every day, even when we were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he's gone."

'''The Knitters''' are a [[Los Angeles]]-based band who play [[country music|country]], [[rockabilly]] and [[folk music]]. The Knitters' name is a play on the name of the folk group [[The Weavers]].<ref name="Lankford">{{cite web | last =Lankford, Jr |first =Ronnie D. |title=The Knitters |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-knitters-mn0000772997/biography |website=All Music |access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>

==Background==

The Knitters formed in 1982 as a side project to the band members' primary commitments. Vocalist [[Exene Cervenka]],  singer/bassist [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] and drummer [[DJ Bonebrake]] were three of the four members of the [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[X (American band)|X]]; guitarist [[Dave Alvin]] was a member of [[roots rock]] band [[The Blasters]] as well as [[The Flesh Eaters]]; and stand-up bassist [[Jonny Ray Bartel]] was a member of [[blues-rock]] band [[The Red Devils (blues band)|The Red Devils]].<ref name="warpedrealitymagazine.com"/>

The Knitters' debut album ''[[Poor Little Critter on the Road]]'' was released in 1985. It included mainly traditional and cover songs, together with some X songs performed in an acoustic style. The album drew on blues, folk, country and rockabilly influences.  In 1999, the label [[Bloodshot Records]] released a track-by-track tribute to the album entitled ''Poor Little Knitter on the Road''.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=482 |access-date=2007-06-09 | work = Rhino  | title = Rhino Recommends – Rzine No.&nbsp;482 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609223259/http://www.rhino.com/rzine/StoryKeeper.lasso?StoryID=482 |archive-date=2007-06-09 }}</ref>

After the debut album's release, all the group members continued to work with their primary bands. Dave Alvin also later pursued a solo career.<ref>{{cite magazine| url = http://harpmagazine.com/reviews/cd_reviews/detail.cfm?article_id=3409 | title =  The Knitters, The Modern Sounds of the Knitters |magazine=[[Harp (magazine)|Harp]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231059/http://harpmagazine.com/reviews/cd_reviews/detail.cfm?article_id=3409 |access-date=2007-09-26 | archive-date = 2007-09-26 }}</ref>

Twenty years later, in 2005, the group released their second and ironically-titled album, ''[[The Modern Sounds of the Knitters]]''. John Doe has been quoted as saying "The Knitters, like their music, don't do anything hasty.<ref name="warpedrealitymagazine.com">{{cite web | url = http://warpedrealitymagazine.com/2006/01/beyond-and-back-with-the-knitters.html | work = Warped Reality | title = Beyond and Back with the Knitters  |access-date=2016-03-23 | date  = 2006-01-22 | author = }}</ref> Since our last record's been out for a while and it did pretty good, we figured it was just about time to put out another."

Heath has a signature guitar from the [[Gretsch]] Guitar company, the [[Gretsch 6120|6120RHH]].

His favorite amplifier was the [[Fender Super Reverb]] but is now the Gretsch Executive.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Heidt |first=John |date=April 2008 |title=Jim Heath: A Reverend By Any Other Name |journal=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]] |volume=22 |issue=6 |page=24}}</ref>

'''Stuart Daniel Baker''' (born November 7, 1954), known by his stage name '''Unknown Hinson''', is an American singer, musician, songwriter, and voice actor.<ref>{{cite web |title= Squidbillies Characters  |url= http://www.adultswim.com/shows/squidbillies/indexpage.html#characters |publisher = AdultSwim.com |access-date= January 5, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= It's good to be King: Unknown Hinson is a legend of his own making  |url= http://www.thedailytimes.com/article/20080815/ENT/20211794 |publisher = TheDailyTimes.Com |access-date= August 14, 2008}}</ref> He was the longtime voice of Early Cuyler in the [[Adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] ''[[Squidbillies]]'' from 2005 to 2019.

==Biography==
Stuart Daniel Baker, a music teacher and studio musician from [[Albemarle, North Carolina]], created his alter-ego for ''The Wild Wild South'', a Charlotte-area public-access program that featured comedy sketches and concert footage. Baker and co-star Don Swan played the characters of Unknown Hinson and Rebel Helms, respectively. After Swan's death in 1995, Baker created ''The Unknown Hinson Show'', a direct spin-off of ''The Wild Wild South''. ''The Unknown Hinson Show'' won [[Creative Loafing|Creative Loafing Charlotte's]] "Best Of" poll for Best Public-Access Television Show four years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainx.com/ae/1999/1027unknown.php |title=Into the Unknown &#124; Asheville Arts and Entertainment &#124; Mountain Xpress |publisher=Mountainx.com |access-date=August 13, 2011}}</ref> After the series ended, Baker continued in his role as Unknown Hinson, performing live concerts and releasing several recordings.

==Career==

===Live performing career===
Hinson has performed with many notable [[rockabilly]], [[country music|country]], and [[psychobilly]] acts such as [[The Reverend Horton Heat]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Hank III]], and [[Ed King]]. Hank III, grandson of [[Hank Williams]], has Hinson's face tattooed on his bicep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/inside-the-heathen-mind-of-hank-iii/Content?oid=929012 | title=Inside the Heathen Mind of Hank III: An interview with country music's self-exiled prince |publisher=[[Boise Weekly]] | date=August 9, 2006| access-date=November 18, 2015}}</ref>
In late 2008, working under the name Danny Baker, Hinson was hired to play bass as well as lead guitar in Billy Bob Thornton's band The Boxmasters. For this  gig, Baker appears without the familiar Unknown Hinson wardrobe and makeup, instead appearing in a vintage '60s suit, white shirt, and black pencil tie. His manager and booking agent was his wife, Margo Baker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/charlotte/obituary.aspx?pid=163309087#fbLoggedOut |title=Margo Elizabeth Cogan Baker Obituary: View Margo Baker's Obituary by Charlotte Observer |publisher=[[Legacy.com]] |access-date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/unknown-hinson |title=Unknown Hinson: Information from |publisher=[[Answers.com]] |access-date=September 4, 2013}}</ref>

According to a November 10, 2012 post on his Facebook page, Hinson decided to quit touring after 17 years. He cited rising costs and indicated his plans to find something new to do. After the death of his wife, Margo Baker, Unknown Hinson resumed touring again.

On June 3, 2020, Baker announced on his Facebook page that he would not be playing any more shows due to [[osteoarthritis]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hinson|first=Unknown|date=June 3, 2020|title=My dear friends, Unfortunately I don't...|url=https://www.facebook.com/Officialunknownhinsonstuartbaker/photos/a.250536291967520/1159941584360315/?type=3&theater|publisher=Facebook.com}}</ref> On July 17, 2023, he announced on his Facebook page that he was recovering from two strokes and undergoing physical therapy.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/Officialunknownhinsonstuartbaker/posts/pfbid02rLvnEmaffWWQuQqGZyaHM4gKzyQXMXQsZ8m8uuLYwk1kUaBuphGS1NT5tMATRVuRl Facebook post from July 17, 2023]</ref>

===Recording career===
[[File:Unknown Hinson.jpg|thumb|upright|Hinson in 2009]]
Unknown Hinson wrote his own music, and produced all of his own recordings. His music often parodied the dark elements of contemporary country and redneck culture. In early 2009, Hinson's "Torture Town" won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards and Vox Pop vote for Best Alternative Country.

===Voice acting career===
Hinson, credited as Baker, provided the voice of Early Cuyler, a balding hillbilly squid from [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]], on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night [[Adult Swim]] program ''[[Squidbillies]]'' for 15 years.<ref name="yasharoff">{{Cite news|last=Yasharoff|first=Hannah|title='Squidbillies' star Unknown Hinson fired over 'extremely offensive' posts about BLM, Dolly Parton|url=https://www.jacksonville.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/08/19/squidbillies-star-unknown-hinson-fired-over-blm-dolly-parton-posts/3398793001/|date=August 19, 2020|access-date=August 19, 2020|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Controversy==
On August 13, 2020, Baker received backlash after posting comments about [[Dolly Parton]], calling her a "bimbo" and "slut" on his Facebook page in response to a recent news article concerning Parton's support of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.<ref name=Andrew/> Not long after this post, the Facebook page went offline, but returned on the following day with the posts concerning Parton removed.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Baker subsequently posted a response to those who were upset, telling liberals to "unfriend" him and telling them to have fun "forsaking your own race, culture, and heritage."<ref name=Andrew>{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Andrew|title= Unknown Hinson, 'Squidbillies' Star, Goes on Tirade About Dolly Parton's Black Lives Matter Support |url= https://popculture.com/country-music/news/unknown-hinson-squidbillies-star-tirade-dolly-parton-black-lives-matter-support//|date=August 19, 2020|access-date=August 19, 2020|website=Pop Culture}}</ref>

The producers of ''Squidbillies'' fired Baker from the series over his remarks.<ref name="yasharoff"/> [[Reverend Musical Instruments|Reverend Guitars]] of Ohio abruptly stopped marketing their Stuart Baker signature series guitars on August 14, 2020, and posted, "we are no longer associated with Unknown Hinson.

Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] "The Queen of Rockabilly". She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.

Jackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song "[[You Can't Have My Love]]". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including "[[Fujiyama Mama]]", "Mean Mean Man" and the top 40 hit "[[Let's Have a Party]]".

In the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included "[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]", "[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]", "[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]" and "[[A Woman Lives for Love]]". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single "[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.

In 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, ''[[Encore (2021 Wanda Jackson album)|Encore]]'', in 2021.

==Early life==
Jackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name="Oklahoma">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver. He also played music in a local band alongside his brother.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=1-5}} Because of limited opportunities in Maud, the family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1941.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=7}} Jackson often sang alongside her parents at home. Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}

In the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: "All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still," she recounted in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}

In Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends. She was featured on program, which impressed the station's disc jockey, who encouraged her to audition for a second KPLR contest.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=33-34}} Jackson won the second contest at KPLR, which allotted Jackson her own 15-minute radio segment.<ref name="allmusic"/> On the show, Jackson performed a set of country songs and recalled having little understanding of how to host a radio show. "I was flying by the seat of my pants, but it didn't scare me to get out on a limb and try something brand new. I liked it," she explained in her biography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=36-38}}

As a teenager, Jackson attended [[Capitol Hill High School]] in Oklahoma City<ref name="Oklahoman">{{cite news |last1=Willert |first1=Tim |title=Singer Wanda Jackson among alumni to be honored by Oklahoma City school foundation |url=https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |access-date=9 July 2021 |publisher=[[The Oklahoman]] |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184754/https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |url-status=live }}</ref> and continued her radio show.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=44}} She also dated fellow student, Leonard Sipes, who would later go by the name [[Tommy Collins (singer)|Tommy Collins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=45-46}} In 1952, Jackson was heard on the air by country singer and local resident, [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The singer invited Jackson to perform with him at the Trianon Ballroom in Oklahoma City. On Thompson's show, Jackson sang "Blue Yodel No. 6" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. "[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar – that's all she thought about," a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}

==Career==
===1953–1955: Country beginnings===
Jackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. "Girls don't sell records!" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: "I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}

[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]
Instead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, "[[You Can't Have My Love]]". Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled "If You Don't Somebody Else Will". Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard" />{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}

Instead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Jackson also did her first performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] while in town.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=69-70}} For the performance, her mother made a dress fitted with [[spaghetti strap]]s and a [[neckline|sweetheart neckline]]. Host [[Ernest Tubb]] told her it was unacceptable, so she covered it with a fringe jacket. She later recalled hearing fellow Opry members making negative comments about her while she was onstage.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Carrigan |first1=Henry |title=THE READING ROOM: Wanda Jackson's Stories Assure 'I'm Still Here' |journal=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |date=April 4, 2019 |url=https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |access-date=12 July 2021 |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712014844/https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |url-status=live }}</ref> "I decided that night that the ''Grand Ole Opry'' scene was not for me," she recounted.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=chapter 6}}

In 1955, Jackson graduated from Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City and began touring. Jackson's father quit his job to become her full-time manager and he hired Bob Neal to book her engagements. Jackson's first concert dates included up-and-coming performer [[Elvis Presley]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=85-86}} Together, the pair worked multiple shows alongside several other country performers in the United States that year.

He played her several [[R&B music|R&B]] records and informed her of rock's growing popularity.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Jackson also joined the cast of the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in 1955.<ref name="CMT Bio">{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Country Legends We Love: Wanda Jackson |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=July 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713035305/http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===1956–1960: Rock and roll years===
[[File:I Gotta Know - Half As Good A Girl - Billboard ad 1956.jpg|thumb|130px|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, July 21, 1956]] 
In 1956, Decca Records released Jackson from her contract. With Hank Thompson's help,{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=18}} she secured a new contract with Capitol Records the same year.<ref name="allmusic"/> At her first Capitol recording session, Jackson cut two country songs and one rock and roll selection. One song, "[[I Gotta Know (Wanda Jackson song)|I Gotta Know]]", incorporated elements of both country and rock. According to Jackson, the song's mixture of rock allowed her to get acquainted with the genre.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=119}} Released as a single in 1956, "I Gotta Know" became Jackson's second commercially successful release, peaking at number 15 on the ''Billboard'' country and western sides chart.<ref name="Whitburn Billboard"/> Jackson continued recording rock and roll music under her Capitol contract and was given full permission to do so by producer Ken Nelson. Jackson also composed several of her Capitol recordings, including "Baby Loves Him", "Cool Love" and "Mean Mean Man".{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=123-27}} She continued recording country music as well, often putting each style on either side of a single release.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}}

Writers and critics have remarked positively about Jackson's recordings from the 1950s and noted their take on women's sexuality. Mary A. Bufwack and [[Robert K. Oermann]] described songs like "Baby Loves Him" as "rockabilly classics". In addition, they commented that Jackson's rock records were "sexually aggressive" and demonstrated "almost frightening savagery".{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Bruce Eder added that Jackson's material was at times "astonishingly raucous and even raunchy".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Queen of Rockabilly'': Wanda Jackson: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714034504/https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, Kurt Wolff found that Jackson's rock material was also mixed with traditional country elements, which added to her musical individuality: "Jackson mixed straight country material and hot-to-the-core rockabilly numbers almost right from the beginning...Songs like 'Fujiyama Mama' and 'Mean Mean Man' were hard and fast, giving her plenty of reason to shimmy around in her glamorous fringe dresses".{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=275}}

In 1957, Jackson began working under a new booking agent, who arranged several tours in 1957 and 1958. Fellow performers included [[Johnny Cash]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Carl Perkins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=131-132}} With her new management, Jackson was making more money, sometimes as much as $500 per gig.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=116}} Meanwhile, her follow-up singles proved unsuccessful in the United States. According to Jackson, Capitol was unsure how to market her. "Capitol was still trying to figure out what to do with me, but they maintained faith that I could have strong potential in the teen market," she recalled in 2017.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=127}} To promote her material, the label chose to release Jackson's [[Wanda Jackson (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1958. The record mixed both rock and country selections.<ref name="debut album">{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=Williams |title=''Wanda Jackson'': Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wanda-jackson-mw0000661809 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=13 July 2021 |archive-date=May 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501033617/https://www.allmusic.com/album/wanda-jackson-mw0000661809 |url-status=live }}</ref> Included were her covers of the rock songs "[[Money Honey (Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters song)|Money Honey]]" and "[[Long Tall Sally]]".

Also in 1958, Jackson saw success overseas with the rock and roll single, "[[Fujiyama Mama]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> Ken Nelson was reluctant to release the song, with its references to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=128-129}} Yet, the disc found commercial appeal with Japanese fans, reaching number one on the nation's music chart.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fox |first1=Courtney |title=The 15 Best Wanda Jackson Songs |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/wanda-jackson-songs/ |website=Wide Open Country |date=March 9, 2021 |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714030958/https://www.wideopencountry.com/wanda-jackson-songs/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The song's success led Jackson to a Japanese tour in 1959. She played venues in major cities including [[Tokyo]] and [[Okinawa (city)|Okinawa]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=145-149}} Upon her return to America, Jackson played in [[Las Vegas]] with Bob Wills and did additional concerts with her newly formed touring band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=154}} At different points, the band lineup included [[Roy Clark]] and black pianist [[Al Downing (musician)|Big Al Downing]].{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} She recalled touring alongside Downing, who was sometimes denied entrance into venues because of his race. In response, Jackson would refuse to work a show unless Downing performed with her. "Look, he's part of our band. If he's not welcome, then none of us are," she once told a club owner.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=154-156}}

In 1960, Jackson's album cover of "[[Let's Have a Party]]" was discovered by an Iowa [[disc jockey]], which led to an increased interest in it by radio listeners.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Upon the encouragement of Capitol Records, "Let's Have a Party" was issued as a single the same year.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=159-160}} By July 1960, the single had reached number 37 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|pop music chart]], becoming her first American rock and roll hit.<ref>{{cite magazine |title="Let's Have a Party" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/wanda-jackson/chart-history/hsi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032346/https://www.billboard.com/music/wanda-jackson/chart-history/HSI/song/576287 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} It also found commercial success in Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name="Australian Songs">{{cite book|title=Australian Charts Book 1970—1992|first=David|last=Kent|isbn=978-0-646-11917-5|year=1993|publisher=Australian Chart Book Pty Ltd, Turramurra, N.S.W.}}</ref><ref name="UK Singles">{{cite web|title=Wanda Jackson — Peak chart positions|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wanda%20jackson/|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|access-date=29 November 2013|archive-date=July 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710021244/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wanda%20jackson/|url-status=live}}</ref> The success of "Let's Have a Party" led to Jackson to rename her band "The Party Timers"<ref name="allmusic"/> and prompted her label to release the compilation, ''[[Rockin' with Wanda]]'' (1960).

Her third studio album for Capitol, as noted, came along in early 1961, titled ''[[There's a Party Goin' On (Wanda Jackson album)|There's a Party Goin' On]]'', which included more rock and roll material.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=163}} Richie Unterberger of AllMusic described the LP as a "pretty solid and energetic set" despite not having "most of Wanda's best rockabilly sides".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Unterberger |first1=Richie |title=''There's a Party Goin' On'': Wanda Jackson: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/theres-a-party-goin-on-mw0000853846 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032346/https://www.allmusic.com/album/theres-a-party-goin-on-mw0000853846 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1961–1971: New languages and return to country music===
In the early 1960s, old school rock and roll musicians lost favor as the "Big Beat" of the [[British Invasion]] grew in popularity.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=262}} Feeling pressure from Capitol, Ken Nelson met with Jackson to discuss which genre she should fit.

After Jackson spent time touring with Elvis Presley, the pair's relationship became romantic in 1955.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Sullivan |first1=James |title=Wanda Jackson Remembers Elvis |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=December 9, 2005 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/wanda-jackson-remembers-elvis-96708/ |access-date=12 September 2021 |archive-date=September 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210913000346/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/wanda-jackson-remembers-elvis-96708/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He asked her to make the relationship official by giving Jackson a small diamond ring that she wore on a necklace.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=103}} In her autobiography, she explained that Presley "won my heart as I was just beginning to understand what it really meant to embrace my femininity and express myself as a young woman."{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=85}} According to Jackson, the pair's relationship ended in 1956 once Presley began appearing in films and [[Colonel Tom Parker]] took control of his career.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=119-121}}

In her teen years, Jackson befriended aspiring country performer [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]]. The two often appeared on the ''Ozark Jubilee'' television show and socialized frequently. Norma Jean began dating local resident, Wendell Goodman, and Jackson sometimes joined them on dates.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=202-204}} In 1961, Norma Jean accepted an offer to become a cast member of ''[[The Porter Wagoner Show]]'' in Nashville and ended her relationship with Goodman. Jackson and Goodman started dating shortly after their breakup. In her 2017 book, she recalled that she fell in love with him prior to their dating: "When they [Norma Jean and Goodman] had first come into the house and I saw Wendell, that was it. It was love at first sight."{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=205-206}} The couple married in 1961.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Goodman had begun a career in computers with IBM, but left the position to become his wife's full-time business manager.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wanda Jackson & Pam Tillis: Rockin' the Country: Women at the Fore |journal=Elmore Magazine |date=May 1, 2007 |url=https://www.elmoremagazine.com/2007/05/influences/wanda-jackson-pam-tillis |access-date=30 August 2021 |archive-date=August 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830010205/https://www.elmoremagazine.com/2007/05/influences/wanda-jackson-pam-tillis |url-status=live }}</ref> He later oversaw and managed his wife's company named Wanda Jackson Enterprises.

The couple had two children together.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Their daughter, Gina, was born in 1962{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=218}} while their son, Greg, was born in 1964.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=220}} Because Jackson's husband traveled with her, their children were kept home and raised by nannies. Jackson's parents also kept the children on weekends. "I knew it wasn't a normal childhood for them, and I've always carried a little guilt about that," she recalled in 2017.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=220-222}}

===Personal challenges and spirituality===

By 1971, Jackson had become increasingly unhappy in her professional and personal life. "I had everything that a person could need or want. But I still couldn't shake that dull but persistent sense of emptiness inside," she later explained.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=258}} She and her husband had also developed a problem with alcohol. Their problems with drinking led Goodman to become physically and verbally abusive with Jackson.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Upon returning from a show, Jackson recalled going to church with her family and having a life-altering experience. "After we got up off our knees, everything was different," she stated in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=262}} The couple found solace in Christianity and dedicated their personal lives to spirituality in 1971.<ref name="allmusic"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} They were later baptized, and the couple went on to state that faith saved their marriage.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=262}}

The couple's belief in their faith would lead them to working with [[Evangelism|Evangelist]]s in [[Dallas, Texas]] during the late 1970s. Her husband set up an office building in the city where that offered resources to various ministries in the local area.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=274-278}} As Jackson's rockabilly music revived in the 1980s, the couple decided to invest less professional time with Christianity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Country Legends We Love: Wanda Jackson |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=30 August 2021 |archive-date=July 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713035305/http://www.cmt.com/news/1821240/country-legends-we-love-wanda-jackson/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> "It was hard to feel right about singing in bars again, but God confirmed in my spirit, time and time again, that that's where He wanted me and that's where I could be most effective," she explained in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=283}}

===Health problems===
In the 2010s, Jackson developed [[pneumonia]] and was hospitalized for a week.<ref name="Rolling Stone 2019"/> A knee replacement became infected with [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and she fell several times in her Oklahoma house, damaging her shoulder.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=309}} In 2017, her internal bleeding was treated at a hospital in [[Tijuana, Mexico]] that focused on nutritional and medical therapy.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=311}} A 2018 stroke led her to retire.<ref name="Rolling Stone 2019"/> She said it would have impaired her more if her daughter had brought her to the hospital later. "I was so fortunate", she told ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2021.<ref name="The Independent"/>

'''Warren Smith''' (February 7, 1932 – January 30, 1980) was an American [[rockabilly]] and [[country music]] singer and guitarist.

==Biography==
Smith was born in [[Humphreys County, Mississippi]], to Ioda and Willie Warren Smith, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in [[Louise, Mississippi]], where they had a small farm and [[dry goods]] store.

Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the [[United States Air Force]] stationed in San Antonio, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], and auditioned, successfully, to play the Cotton Club, a local nightclub. The steel guitarist [[Stan Kesler]], who was playing there with the Snearly Ranch Boys, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to [[Sun Records]] to audition for [[Sam Phillips]], with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup.

Phillips liked what he heard and decided that "Rock 'n' Roll Ruby", a song credited to [[Johnny Cash]], would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that the song was actually written by [[George Jones]] and sold to Cash for $40.){{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Smith recorded it on February 5, 1956. Phillips, playing it safe in case rock and roll did not maintain its popularity, released it with a country crooner, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry", on the flip side. By May 26, "Rock 'n' Roll Ruby" had reached number 1 on the local pop chart; this record, his first for Sun, went on to outsell the first Sun releases by [[Elvis Presley]], Johnny Cash and [[Carl Perkins]].

In August 1956, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release, "[[Ubangi Stomp]]", an infectious rocker with crude lyrics and vocals suggesting an African chief with the [[syntax]] of a movie Indian. For the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], he recorded the classic ballad "[[The Gypsy Laddie|Black Jack David]]", a song that originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American South; it may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock-and-roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success, this record did not sell as well as Smith's debut.

In 1957, Smith recorded "So Long, I'm Gone", a song written by [[Roy Orbison]]. It became his biggest hit for Sun, peaking at number 74 on the ''Billboard'' national chart. But Sun had no cash to promote it, as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]". Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun, including a [[cover version]] of [[Slim Harpo]]'s "Got Love If You Want It" (recorded in October 1957), but these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958, seeing his future in [[country music]], he cut a final record for Sun, a cover version of [[Don Gibson]]'s "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' calling it "ultra commercial", this record also did not sell well. Like other artists such as [[Sonny Burgess]], [[Hayden Thompson]], [[Billy Lee Riley]] and [[Ray Harris]], Smith had little success on the charts.<ref name="Music">{{cite book

In 1959, Smith and his wife and son moved from Mississippi to California, settling in Sherman Oaks, not far from Johnny and Vivian Cash. Cash offered Smith a spot on his show, but Smith turned it down, seeing himself as a headliner, not a supporting player. In early 1960, Smith signed a contract with [[Liberty Records]] and immediately had a hit with "I Don't Believe I'll Fall in Love Today", which went to number 5 on the ''Billboard'' country and Western chart. This record and subsequent Liberty releases were produced by [[Joe Allison]] and featured one of California's best country session musicians, [[Ralph Mooney]], on [[pedal steel guitar]]. Smith scored again with his next record for Liberty, "Odds and Ends, Bits and Pieces", written by [[Harlan Howard]]. He recorded several more tracks for Liberty, mostly cover versions of recent country hits, to fill out an album, ''The First Country Collection of Warren Smith''. He continued to record for Liberty, with some success, and toured with his band, from 1960 to 1965.

On August 17, 1965, Smith suffered severe back injuries in a car crash in [[LaGrange, Texas]]. It took nearly a year for him to recover. By this time, his contract with Liberty had lapsed. He made several attempts to restart his career, first with a small, virtually amateur label called Skill Records, and then with [[Mercury Records]], but addictions to pills and alcohol held him back. Eventually, he was convicted of robbing a pharmacy and sentenced to an 18-month term in an Alabama prison.

After his release from prison, Smith again tried to restart his career. He got some publicity from the rockabilly revival in the late 1970s. In 1977 he was invited to appear at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], on a bill featuring [[Charlie Feathers]], [[Buddy Knox]] and [[Jack Scott (singer)|Jack Scott]]. To his shock, Smith was received in London with standing ovations. His reception in England boosted his spirits and, upon his return to the United States, he began to perform with newfound vigor. In November 1978, Smith and fellow Sun alumnus [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]] toured Europe, again with great success.

Smith died of a heart attack, at 47 years of age, in 1980, while preparing for another European tour.

==Legacy==
Smith's contribution to rockabilly music has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. [[Bob Dylan]] repeatedly featured Smith on his [[XM Satellite Radio]] show, ''[[Theme Time Radio Hour]]'', playing Smith's records "Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache", "Uranium Rock", "Ubangi Stomp" and "So Long, I'm Gone". Dylan recorded a studio version of "Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache" in 2001; he also played that song and another recorded by Smith, "Uranium Rock", in concert in 1986. 
In 2015, "Uranium Rock" was also featured in the video game ''[[Fallout 4]]''. "Uranium Rock" was also covered by [[The Cramps]] on their second compilation album "Bad Music For Bad People".

==Biography==
===Early life and rise to fame===
[[File:Wynn Stewart.png|thumb|right|Stewart in 1970]]
Stewart was born in [[Morrisville, Missouri|Morrisville]], Missouri, United States,<ref name="Larkin50"/> in 1934, during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. He spent most of his childhood moving around the country with his [[sharecropping]] family. After [[World War II]], Stewart spent a year working at [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], Missouri.<ref name="Larkin50"/> In 1948, he moved to California with his family. Stewart originally wanted to become a professional baseball player, but suffered from a hand disease and was also too short to play professional baseball.<ref name="Larkin50"/> In high school, Stewart formed a band that played at clubs around California. He soon met [[steel guitar]]ist [[Ralph Mooney]], who joined Stewart's band.<ref name="Larkin50"/> The group's lineup consisted of guitarist [[Roy Nichols]] and bassist [[Bobby Austin (musician)|Bobby Austin]].

In 1954, Stewart signed a recording contract with an independent record label called [[Intro Records]].<ref name="Larkin50"/> He released two singles on Intro. The first was called "I've Waited a Lifetime" and the second was "Strolling". Both failed to reach on the country music chart. His second single caught the attention of [[Skeets McDonald]], one of Stewart's idols. He liked the song so much, he arranged an audition with [[Capitol Records]] for Stewart. By the summer of 1956, Stewart signed with Capitol.<ref name="Larkin50"/> He soon recorded and released his first single from the label, "Waltz of the Angels", that same year.<ref name="Larkin50"/> The song went to No. 14 on the country chart, and gave Stewart his first major hit. The song later became a duet hit for [[George Jones]] and [[Margie Singleton]]. However, Stewart did not stay with Capitol much longer as none of his other singles was gaining much success. His last single for Capitol (until his 1960s return) was called "I Wish I Could Stay the Same", released in September 1957.

=== Nightclub owner===
Stewart was part owner of a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada, nightclub called Nashville Nevada during the early 1960s.<ref name="Larkin50"/> He performed there six nights a week and also hosted his own television show. A young [[Merle Haggard]] sat in with the band while Stewart was out of town in 1962. Stewart returned early, was impressed with Haggard's performance, and hired him as his regular bass player. He wrote Haggard's first hit "Sing a Sad Song".<ref name="Larkin50"/>

"Wynn's sound was what influenced Buck and me both," Haggard has said, "and in a strange twist of fate, his band was the heart of the old Frizzell band – Roy Nichols was part of the Lefty band, and he went to Wynn Stewart and ran into Ralph Mooney, who played the steel, and they were the basis of the modern West Coast sound."{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Height of his career===
With the help of songwriter [[Harlan Howard]], Stewart signed with Jackpot Records, a subsidiary label of [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]], in 1958. He recorded a string of singles that were a mix of different styles, ranging from pop to [[rockabilly]]. In 1959, he moved to the parent Challenge label and released a single called "Wishful Thinking".<ref name="Larkin50"/> The song proved a breakthrough for Stewart when it reached No. 5 in 1960. Following the song's success, Stewart moved to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada, where he hosted a local TV show and was part owner of a nightclub, The Nashville Nevada.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

Stewart continued to have sizable hits, including the [[Jan Howard]] duet called "[[Wrong Company]]", and "Big, Big Love", among others. Stewart moved back to the center of the Bakersfield sound, California, in 1965. He re-signed with Capitol. [[Cliffie Stone]], who was an A & R director with Capitol introduced Wynn to a young arranger-guitarist Bill Aken (Zane Ashton) who would often over-dub unique guitar parts on Wynn's recordings. His first couple of singles for the label proved unsuccessful once again for Stewart, but his fifth single was a different story. "[[It's Such a Pretty World Today]]" was released in 1967 and became the biggest hit of his career.<ref name="Larkin50"/> The song went to No. 1 on the country music chart and spent two weeks there. It was also the country music Song of the Year and a Gold record. Its follow-up, "Cause I Have You", was a Top 10 hit in 1967. Following his singles' success, Stewart recorded more soft, pop-friendly material, which gave Stewart his biggest hits into the 1970s.

By 1972, Stewart moved to [[RCA Records]] with "Paint Me a Rainbow" being his biggest hit for the label. He also briefly signed with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1974. Over the next three years, Stewart released singles but did not break the country Top 40. In 1975, he signed with [[Playboy Records]] and managed a Top 10 hit in 1976 called "After The Storm". Although he stayed with Playboy, he only had one other big hit, his version of "Sing a Sad Song", which went to No. 19 in 1977.<ref name="Larkin50"/>

===Later career and death===
Stewart started his own label in 1978 called WIN. His first single, "Eyes as Big as Dallas", broke the Top 40. Although country music was changing in the late 1970s, moving to the smooth sounds of [[country pop]], he was not able to continue to achieve success, which was hampered by his alcoholism.<ref name="Larkin50"/> In the early 1980s, Stewart quit performing, but a few years on and Stewart launched a comeback, with an extensive tour and a new album.

During the tour, Stewart suddenly died of a heart attack on July 17, 1985.<ref name="Larkin50"/> Following Stewart's death, his song "Wait 'Til I Get My Hands on You" became a minor hit.
