==Biography==
Michael Hobby and Bill Satcher grew up in [[Newberry, South Carolina]], where they began writing songs at the age of 15.

The name "A Thousand Horses" came from a song on their first EP.<ref name="10questions">{{cite web|author= |url=http://focusonthe615.com/2012/02/09/10-questions-with-a-thousand-horses/ |title=10 Questions With A Thousand Horses |publisher=FOCUS on the 615 |date=February 9, 2012 |access-date=July 13, 2015}}</ref> They enjoy writing their own original songs, but they occasionally collaborate with other writers around Nashville.

Their debut E.P., ''A Thousand Horses'', was released on August 17, 2010, under [[Republic Nashville]]. It was recorded in six days in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake, California]], with producer [[Dave Cobb]].

The song "Suicide Eyes" from the E.P. was featured in the movie ''[[Footloose (2011 film)|Footloose]]'' starring [[Kenny Wormald]] and [[Julianne Hough]]. The director, Craig Brewer, found the song and knew that it fit the vibe for the movie.<ref name="10questions"/>

For their performance at the Austin City Limits festival in 2014, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hailed the band as the best up-and-comer, praising their "undeniable energy and stage presence [and] their live performance".<ref name="rollingreview">{{cite web|last=Edwards |first=Gavin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/austin-city-limits-2014-country-music-performances-20141007/best-up-and-comer-a-thousand-horses-20141007/ |title=Best Up-and-Comer: A Thousand Horses - Austin City Limits 2014's Standout Performances |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=October 7, 2014 |access-date=July 13, 2015}}</ref>

Zach Brown quit the band in 2023 to spend more time with family.

===Influences===
A Thousand Horses self-identifies as a hybrid of English rock, country, American rock, soul, and blues. Their sound mimics [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], the [[Allman Brothers]], the [[Black Crowes]], and the [[Rolling Stones]] in the context of modern country. Hobby's songwriting is rooted in such songwriters as [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Noel Gallagher]].<ref name="athwebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.athousandhorses.com/ |title=Official Site |publisher=A Thousand Horses |date= |access-date=July 13, 2015}}</ref>

'''Alabama''' is an American [[country music]] band formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]], in 1969. The band was founded by [[Randy Owen]] ([[lead vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]]) and his cousin Teddy Gentry ([[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]). They were soon joined by another cousin, [[Jeff Cook]] ([[lead guitar]], [[fiddle]], and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the [[Southeast United States|Southeast]] bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by [[RCA Records]] for a recording deal.

Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, when the band had 27 country No. 1 hits, seven multi-platinum albums, and received numerous major awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, "[[Tennessee River (song)|Tennessee River]]", began a streak of 21 country No. 1 singles, including "[[Love in the First Degree (Alabama song)|Love in the First Degree]]" (1981), "[[Mountain Music (song)|Mountain Music]]" (1982), "[[Dixieland Delight]]" (1983), "[[If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)]]" (1984) and "[[Song of the South (song)|Song of the South]]" (1988). The band's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to produce hit singles and multi-platinum albums. Alabama disbanded in 2004 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and has continued to record and tour worldwide.

The band's blend of traditional [[country music]] and [[Southern rock]] combined with elements of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music]] gave it a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] appeal that helped lead to their success. They also [[concert|toured]] extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and sets inspired by [[rock concert]]s into their shows. The band has over 41 number-one country records on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to their credit and have sold over 75&nbsp;million records, making them the [[List of best-selling music artists|most successful band in country music history]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|title=Teddy Gentry of the group Alabama will sing his songs and tell stories behind them at Samford University|newspaper=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=October 3, 2014|first=Cary|last=Estes|access-date=December 17, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217075942/http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|archive-date=December 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/07/26/alabama-southern-drawl-first-album--14-years/30411243/|title=After 14 years, Alabama is back with 'Southern Drawl'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 27, 2015|access-date=December 20, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052347/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/07/26/alabama-southern-drawl-first-album--14-years/30411243/|archive-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band and wrote that "It's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=6}}

==History==

===1969–1979: Formation and early years===
[[Image:FortPayneAir.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alabama formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]] (seen here in 1999).]]

In the ensuing years, Owen stayed active as a solo act, Cook with his Allstar Goodtime Band and Gentry as a producer and with his band Rockit City.<ref name=usatoday>{{cite journal| last =Mansfield| first =Brian| date =April 5, 2013| title =On the Road Again: Alabama celebrates 40 years| journal =[[USA Today]]| url =https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/04/05/alabama-40th-anniversary-tour-on-the-road-again/2056529/| url-status =live| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161002004325/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/04/05/alabama-40th-anniversary-tour-on-the-road-again/2056529/| archive-date =October 2, 2016}}</ref> Herndon and the other group members had a difficult relationship during the band's career.<ref name=tenn1>{{cite journal| last =Watts| first =Cindy| date =August 23, 2013| title =Alabama's Randy Owen says drummer Mark Herndon wasn't invited to reunion| journal =[[The Tennessean]]| url =http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2013/08/23/alabamas-randy-owen-says-drummer-mark-herndon-wasnt-invited-to-reunion/| access-date =July 6, 2014| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://archive.today/20140709091904/http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2013/08/23/alabamas-randy-owen-says-drummer-mark-herndon-wasnt-invited-to-reunion/| archive-date =July 9, 2014}}</ref> While he was present in each press photo and a photo of him once hung at Alabama's fan club and museum, Owen contended that he was never an official member of the group. He claimed his inclusion in photos was the label's idea, and that Herndon was a paid employee of the band, rather than a member.<ref name="tenn1"/> In May 2008, the other members of the group sued Herndon for $202,670 in money allegedly overpaid to him three years earlier after the band's farewell tour concluded.<ref name="herndon"/> This money was factored into the net profit and given to Herndon before accounting was completed, an allegation Herndon has denied. The band did not sue Herndon until he requested money from the multiple live albums and songs that the band had released but never paid Herndon for playing on.<ref name=herndon>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-06-07-alabama-sues-drummer_N.htm|title=Country group Alabama sues drummer for $200K|date=June 7, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210020316/http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-06-07-alabama-sues-drummer_N.htm|archive-date=December 10, 2011}}</ref> Owen stated that RCA desired Herndon in the band so their image could be comparable to [[the Beatles]].<ref name="tenn"/> Despite their troubles, he stated they had no hard feelings in an interview years later: "I don't have one thing against him in any way in the world."<ref name="tenn"/>

Owen was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 2010, but he was later given a clean bill of health, which led to the band's reunion, without Herndon.<ref name="tenn"/> Following [[2011 Super Outbreak|a series of tornadoes]] destroying homes and businesses throughout their state in 2011, Alabama assembled a benefit concert in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], called Bama Rising.<ref name="tenn"/> Featuring the band's first set since 2004, alongside [[Luke Bryan]], [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Brad Paisley]], the concert raised $2.1&nbsp;million. "I guess we realized that maybe we missed the playing&nbsp;... and five or six years had gone by and we were like, 'Maybe that wasn't as bad as we remember it being,'" said Gentry.<ref name="tenn"/> In celebration of the group's 40th anniversary, Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour, referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians.<ref name="usatoday"/> They also undertook a short cruise, The Alabama & Friends Festival at Sea, which left for the [[Bahamas]] on Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Pearl ship.<ref name=reuters>{{cite news| last =Hackett| first =Vernell| date =April 5, 2013| title =Country band Alabama back on road, 10 years after saying goodbye| work =[[Reuters]]| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-alabama-idUSBRE9340UN20130405| access-date =July 6, 2014| url-status =live| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125325/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/05/entertainment-us-alabama-idUSBRE9340UN20130405| archive-date =July 14, 2014}}</ref> In addition, the band released ''[[Alabama & Friends]]'', a [[tribute album]] encompassing covers from newer artists such as [[Jason Aldean]] and [[Florida Georgia Line]], in addition to two new tracks by Alabama.<ref name="tenn"/>

===2015–present: New music and death of Jeff Cook===
The band released their first new studio album in 14 years, ''[[Southern Drawl (album)|Southern Drawl]]'', on September 18, 2015, via BMG Chrysalis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/alabama-southern-drawl/|title=Alabama Announce 'Southern Drawl,' First Album of New Songs in 14 Years|work=The Boot|date=July 28, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731002949/http://theboot.com/alabama-southern-drawl/|archive-date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> In 2016, Alabama was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on "''Forever Country''", a mash-up track of "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]", and "[[I Will Always Love You]]" that celebrates 50 years of the [[CMA Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/scenes-cmas-historic-music-video-featuring-30-country/story?id=42129062|title=30 Country Music Stars Join Forces for Historic CMA Music Video|date=22 September 2016|website=ABC News|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730231526/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/scenes-cmas-historic-music-video-featuring-30-country/story?id=42129062|archive-date=30 July 2017}}</ref>

In April 2017, guitarist Jeff Cook announced in a video that he would reduce the number of shows for which he would be in attendance while the band was on tour, due to his struggle with [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]]. He had been diagnosed four years prior, and this was his first public announcement about his condition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/music/2017/04/11/alabama-jeff-cook-parkinsons-diagnosis/|title=Alabama's Jeff Cook Announces Parkinson's Diagnosis|date=2017-04-11|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411220141/http://ew.com/music/2017/04/11/alabama-jeff-cook-parkinsons-diagnosis/|archive-date=2017-04-11}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Alabama's music mixes country, rock, and pop, particularly evident in their musical concept: the band was one of the first country bands to achieve significant airplay.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Despite their influences from other genres, the band was most inspired by country music, which is most evident in their "harmonies, songwriting, and approach."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that the band is "indebted to country, particularly the [[Bakersfield sound]] of [[Merle Haggard]], and the sound of [[country pop|Nashville pop]]."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} The band echoed its country upbringing in one of its first trade articles: "We're country first and crossover second. If crossovers come, that's great, but we'd rather have a No. 1. country song than be lost in the middle of both country and pop charts," said Owen.<ref name=billboard2>{{cite magazine| last =Wells| first =Robyn| date =December 13, 1980| title =Alabama Makes Its Mark| magazine =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| volume =92| issue = 50| publisher =[[Prometheus Global Media]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0006-2510}}</ref>

By the mid-1980s, the band increasingly moved toward a general [[pop-rock]] sound, "going for splashier productions with a more heavily amplified sound."<ref name=BiographicalDictionary>Carlin, Richard. (2002). ''Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary''. [[London]]: [[Routledge]], 540 pp. First edition, 2002.</ref> Alabama's lyrics often centered on their homeland. Their first hit single, "Tennessee River", recounts being "born across the river in the mountains I call home," while "Dixieland Delight" chronicles cruising down a rural Tennessee [[Byway (road)|byway]].<ref name="tenn"/>

==Chart records, sales, and awards==

===Awards===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Alabama}}
Alabama is the most awarded band in the history of country music, with over 200 awards from a variety of organizations.<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1981, Alabama won both the Vocal Group of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year honors from the CMAs. It also won the ACM's Vocal Group of the Year award, and ''Billboard''{{'s}} New Group of the Year honors. The group won the CMA's prestigious Entertainer of the Year award for three consecutive years (1982–84), and the ACM's Entertainer of the Year award five times (1982–86).<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1989, Alabama was named Artist of the Decade by the ACM. In addition, Alabama has also received the [[Music Business Association|NARM Gift of Music]] award, the [[Alabama Hall of Fame]] Distinguished Service award, the Country Radio Broadcasters Humanitarian Award, the [[Prince Matchabelli]] National Hero Award, the [[Bob Hope Humanitarian Award]], and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name="billboard1"/>

==Legacy==

===Impact===
Alabama has been credited with "substantially broadening country's audience while becoming one of the most popular acts in American musical history" by Michael McCall of ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}} The band was notable for its three-person lead (as "most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band"), their collective hair length and facial hair (which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier), and their prominent electric bass and drums.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups, and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songs.<ref name="tenn"/> Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience, although their clean-cut image appealed to the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], older country audience as well.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> Kurt Wolff described the band's appeal: "They're just rebel enough for the young folks, but their parents also dig the boys' pretty harmonies, sentimental soft spots, and old-fashioned family values."<ref name=wolff>Wolff, Kurt. (2000). ''Country Music: The Rough Guide''. Rough Guides, 608 pp. First edition, 2000.</ref> Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne, and also raised awareness for environmental issues.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}}

The band's incorporation of rock and roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as [[Restless Heart]], [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], [[Diamond Rio]], [[Lonestar]], [[Ricochet (band)|Ricochet]], and [[the Mavericks]].{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}<ref name="billboard1"/> According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', the group's diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had it not been for Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}} Prior to Alabama's unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}}

Despite their successes, Alabama's career was loathed by music critics of the day, citing the "vacuous songs and watered-down, middle-of-the-road arrangements" that blurred lines between country and pop.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' once argued the band "render[s] country music all but indistinguishable from pop" and thus "trivializes some of country's most hallowed traditions."{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=8}} Indeed, reviewers such as Wolff consider the band's "overriding problem" their calculated sound, which leads many contemporary music critics to label the band mediocre.<ref name="wolff"/>

===Philanthropy===
Beginning in 1982 and continuing until 1997, Alabama sponsored the June Jam, a music festival in Fort Payne, which at its peak drew 60,000 fans and raised millions for local charities.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} The group also held "Fan Appreciation Days", weekend events that included a golf tournament and a songwriters concert that raised money for charities in Fort Payne.<ref name="billboard1"/> Owen spearheaded "Country Cares for Kids", an annual country [[Telethon|radiothon]] that raised over $70&nbsp;million for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name="billboard1"/>

It was the only other concert he had attended before he became a singer.<ref name=":0"/> In comparison, his father would take long trips with Zimmerman playing [[country music]] on the radio.

Prior to making music, he worked in the [[meat-packing industry]] in 2016. Shortly after graduating, he relocated to West Virginia to work on a union gas [[pipeline]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warnermusicnashville.com/artist/bailey-zimmerman|title=Bailey Zimmerman (Bio)|work=[[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Nashville]]|access-date=June 19, 2022|archive-date=June 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220619014605/https://www.warnermusicnashville.com/artist/bailey-zimmerman|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=TikTok - Make Your Day |url=https://www.tiktok.com/@bailey.zimmerman/video/6877684211571117318 |access-date=2024-04-10 |website=www.tiktok.com}}</ref> He graduated from [[North Clay High School]] on May 12, 2018.<ref>{{Citation |title=2018 North Clay High School Graduation LIVE | date=May 12, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYGZrE8cJvQ |access-date=2024-02-21 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=North Clay High School Alumni |url=https://www.allhighschools.com/school/north-clay-high-school/1000004743 |access-date=February 21, 2024 |website=AllHighSchools}}</ref> Due to a lack of time spent with his family, he quit pipelining to pursue a truck lift venture with his stepbrother's welding business Top Notch Metal Worx.

== Career ==

=== Early career (2020–2021) ===
While awaiting the completion of a customer's build at his stepbrother's establishment, Bailey recorded himself singing "[[Stay (Black Stone Cherry song)|Stay]]" by [[Black Stone Cherry]] for [[Snapchat]]. His motivation was to impress girls. Songwriter Gavin Lucas, whose father had been Bailey's school bus driver in elementary school, came across Bailey's story and was taken aback by his singing ability. Lucas informed Bailey that the video had been widely shared, and he expressed interest in hearing some of Bailey's own songs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Meet Bailey Zimmerman, Country's Biggest New Star Who Still Can't Believe He's Famous {{!}} GRAMMY.com |url=https://grammy.com/news/bailey-zimmerman-new-album-religiously-rock-and-a-hard-place-fall-in-love-tiktok-songs-never-comin-home-morgan-wallen-tour-opener-debut |access-date=2024-04-10 |website=grammy.com}}</ref> Several weeks later, while at his uncle's body shop, Lucas approached Bailey with a request to collaborate on a song. In response, Bailey penned the first verse of "Never Comin' Home." Subsequently, they captured a video of Bailey performing the song with Lucas accompanying on guitar.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Freeman |first=Jon |date=2023-03-17 |title=Bailey Zimmerman Was Working a Gas Pipeline and Making Truck TikToks.

In December 2020, Zimmerman started sharing original music on his TikTok account, notably featuring "Never Comin' Home." Within a mere five hours, a snippet of the song had garnered over a million views. Motivated by this rapid success, he secured a studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to professionally record the track, investing $3,000. He made the decision to resign from his job shortly after. With finances tight, he turned to his mother, requesting $1,500. He conveyed to her the escalating traction of his song and his aspirations to pursue a career as a Country singer.<ref name=":1" />

On February 3, 2021, he released his debut single "Never Comin' Home", which later entered the top 20 on [[Spotify]]'s Viral Chart in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://charts.spotify.com/charts/view/viral-us-daily/2021-03-15/|title=Daily Viral Songs USA: March 15, 2021|work=[[Spotify]]|access-date=June 19, 2022}}</ref> The co-manager at 10th Street Entertainment Scott Frazier came across Zimmerman on TikTok and subsequently introduced him to Core Entertainment principals Kevin Zaruk and Simon Tikhman.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ZIMMERMAN UNBOUND |url=https://hitsdailydouble.com/music_city&id=327870&title=ZIMMERMAN-UNBOUND |access-date=2024-03-05 |website=HITS Daily Double |language=en}}</ref> He later signed to Core Entertainment in August 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hollabaugh |first=Lorie |date=2021-08-19 |title=Bailey Zimmerman Signs With The Core Entertainment, 10th Street Entertainment |url=https://musicrow.com/2021/08/bailey-zimmerman-signs-with-the-core-entertainment-10th-street-entertainment/ |access-date=2024-03-05 |website=MusicRow.com |language=en-US}}</ref> The same month, he performed his first show at "Rock The South 2021" with a backing band he only met three days prior to the performance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reynolds |first=Scott |date=2021-09-18 |title=Louisville artist manager helping musicians achieve dreams |url=https://www.wdrb.com/news/louisville-artist-manager-helping-musicians-achieve-dreams/article_f42d322e-18e5-11ec-bd4d-4f0574d5a041.html |access-date=2024-03-05 |website=WDRB |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
Blackberry Smoke was formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2000. They are the first independently released artist to hit No. 1 on the [[Billboard Country Albums|Billboard Country Album]] charts in modern history. Their debut album, ''Bad Luck Ain't No Crime'', was released in 2003. Their second album released in 2009, ''Little Piece of Dixie''. has been featured by ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine and other publications.<ref name="pastemag">{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/whitman/2009/05/blackberry-smoke----little-piece-of-dixie.html |title=Blackberry Smoke – Little Piece of Dixie :: Blogs :: Andy Whitman on Music :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=May 14, 2009 |access-date=January 9, 2013 |archive-date=March 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305010734/http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/whitman/2009/05/blackberry-smoke----little-piece-of-dixie.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Fred |url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2012/08/12/blackberry-smoke-the-whippoorwill-2012/ |title=Blackberry Smoke – The Whippoorwill (2012) |date=August 12, 2012 |publisher=Somethingelsereviews.com |access-date=January 9, 2013}}</ref>

'''Harold Elwin''' "'''Bo'''" '''Bice Jr.''' (born November 1, 1975) is an American singer and musician who was the runner-up against [[Carrie Underwood]] in the [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''. Prior to auditioning for ''American Idol'', Bice released a solo album as well as a few albums with his bands while performing on the night club circuit.

Bice charted in 2005 at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with a rendition of "[[Inside Your Heaven]]" from ''American Idol''. He released the album ''[[The Real Thing (Bo Bice album)|The Real Thing]]'' after ''American Idol'' to minor success before being dropped by RCA Records. He started his own record label Sugar Money and subsequently released two more albums, ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]'' and ''[[3 (Bo Bice album)|3]].'' He was also the lead singer of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] from 2013 until 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/ |title=Blood Sweat & Tears official web site |access-date=2014-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092029/http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/ |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Childhood ==
Bice was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] to Nancy and Harold Elwin Bice. His mother was a gospel singer as were his grandmother, great-grandmother, and aunts. Bice was [[nickname]]d "Bogart" as a newborn by his grandmother, "Granny Madge", because she thought he had "[[Humphrey Bogart]] eyes". His family continued to call him Bogart, but when Bice was in kindergarten he shortened it to "Bo" because he did not think Bogart was cool. Bice's parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother remarried years later. Bice grew up with his mother and step-father, Earle Downes, a Coca-Cola manager, step-sisters Jenny and Sharan Downes, and half-brother John Cohran. Bice has two other half-siblings, Candace and Matthew, on his biological father's side. The Downes family moved around the [[Southern United States|South]] frequently. They lived in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], including the metro area of [[Atlanta]]. In 1990 when Bice was 14 years old they moved to England, as part of his step-father's European assignment with [[Coca-Cola]] in London.

Bice spent his teenage years living in [[Gerrards Cross]]. Bice attended [[London Central High School]], a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] school primarily for children whose parents served in the military or worked at the U.S. Embassy. In high school, he carried his [[guitar]] everywhere and played [[American football|football]]. It was around this time when Bice worked with some English [[alternative rock]] musicians.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He formed his first band, Spinning Jenny, while living there. Bice would have graduated in 1994, but in the fall of 1993, Bice dropped out of high school just before turning 18 to move back to Alabama, where he earned his [[GED]] and attended classes at [[Calhoun Community College]] from November 1996 to May 1997.

== Career==
===Career beginnings and ''American Idol'': 1997–2005===
Upon leaving Calhoun and spending one semester at the [[University of North Alabama]] in [[Florence, Alabama|Florence]], Bice turned professional and performed in shows all across the United States, the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and Europe. He was a veteran of the [[nightclub]] circuit, releasing his first CD in 1995 with his band Purge.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ortega |first=Shawna |url=http://www.songfacts.com/int/2008/08/bo-bice.html |title=Bo Bice: Songwriter Interviews |publisher=Songfacts |date=2008-07-23 |access-date=October 5, 2008 |archive-date=October 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125127/http://www.songfacts.com/int/2008/08/bo-bice.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> His other pre-''Idol'' bands include Blue Suede Nickel and [[Sugar Money (band)|SugarMoney]]. Among his credits were opening for [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]] and [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]] as well as performing live and recording with [[Johnny Neel]], formerly of [[The Allman Brothers Band]]. Bice had recorded other albums prior to his stint on ''American Idol'', which included ''Ex Gratia'' (1999) with his band Purge, and ''Recipe for Flavor'' (2000) with SugarMoney. In 2001, Bice was charged with purchasing [[cocaine]] at a [[strip club]]. In 2003, Bice was arrested for possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[drug paraphernalia]] and [[public intoxication]]. He avoided jail time by agreeing to enter a [[drug rehabilitation|drug program]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20120906201505/http://www.popcrunch.com/busted-100-celebrities-arrested-for-drug-possession/Busted! 100 Celebrities Arrested For Drug Possession] from PopCrunch.com</ref><ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0427051_bo_bice_american_idol_1.html "Idol" Finalist Dodged Cocaine, Pot Raps] from ''[[The Smoking Gun]]''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1500954/20050428/id_0.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502050128/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1500954/20050428/id_0.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 2, 2008 |title='Idol' Singer Bo Bice Has Drug Rap Sheet, Court Papers Show |publisher=MTV News}}</ref>

For the 2005 season, ''Idol'' producers raised their required age limit from 16–24 to 16–28. In August 2004, Bice’s mother and several other family members encouraged him to go try out, since he was within the eligible age limit (he would turn 29 in November 2004). Along with [[Constantine Maroulis]] and [[Taylor Hicks]] (winner of Season 5), Bice was one of the oldest contestants to audition and participate on ''American Idol''. Bice and Maroulis were among the first contestants to compete using the [[Rock music|rock]] idiom.<ref name="Kaufman">{{Cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title='American Idol' Vets Bo Bice, Constantine Maroulis Can't Stop Rockin' |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1560421/20070524/bice__bo.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528063956/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1560421/20070524/bice__bo.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 28, 2007 |access-date=2016-05-17 |publisher=MTV }}</ref> His performance in the audition stage of The Allman Brothers Band's song "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]" drew raves from the judges. His later performances established him as one of the favorites in the competition. During the final three performance show, Bice took the risk of performing without a band or backup singers. He sang "In a Dream", an obscure song recorded by [[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]].

In June 2005, Bice was quoted in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that his last thought during the ''Idol'' finale was, "Please, God, don't let me win this thing."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=20050616&id=7L8iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E7YFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5114,4458921 |title=Bice: 'Please, God, Don't Let Me Win This Thing.' |work=Beaver County Times |date=2005-06-15 |via=Google News Archive Search}}</ref> In comments during a subsequent appearance on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', Bice backed off this stance a bit, saying that he thanked all those who had voted for him. He lost the final, ending up runner-up to [[Carrie Underwood]]. In Alabama, May 24 was declared "Bo Bice Day" by Governor [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]]. Two members of the group [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] surprised Bice during his trip home from ''Idol'' and performed "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]" with him in his home town of [[Helena, Alabama]].

===Post-''Idol'', marriage and fatherhood: 2005===
Signed to [[RCA]] Records, Bice's first single, released June 21, 2005, was his version of "[[Inside Your Heaven]]". The single debuted at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Chart and number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot Single Sales chart. Bice's single replaced [[Carrie Underwood]]'s version of the same song at number one. It was [[Gold certification|certified Gold]] in late July 2005. Bice was invited to the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] by [[Trey Anastasio]]. He sang a song with [[Willie Nelson]] at a Birmingham concert and was invited by Nelson to perform at [[Farm Aid]]. Bice appeared on [[Carlos Santana]]'s 2005 album ''[[All That I Am (Santana album)|All That I Am]]'' with the song "Brown Skin Girl". On June 15, 2005, Bice married long-time girlfriend Caroline Fisher in [[Helena, Alabama]]. Bice had met her when he was working as a guitar store manager, and frequented the Ragtime Cafe in [[Hoover, Alabama]] where she was working her way through college as a waitress. Their first child, a son, was born in September 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-06-30-bice-marries_x.htm |work=USA Today |title='American Idol' runner-up Bo Bice marries |date=2005-06-30}}</ref> A second son was born in August 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/american-idol-bo-bice-and-wife-welcome-baby-boy |title=EXCLUSIVE: American Idol Runner-Up Bo Bice & Wife Welcome Baby Boy |date=2008-08-05 |work=Us Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903094459/http://www.usmagazine.com/american-idol-bo-bice-and-wife-welcome-baby-boy |archive-date=2008-09-03}}</ref> A third son was born in January 2010 this was Ean Bice.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.com/parents/bo-bice-welcomes-son-ean-jacob/amp/ |title=Bo Bice Welcomes Son Ean Jacob |date=2010-01-22 |work=People |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130012523/http://celebrity-babies.com/2010/01/22/bo-bice-welcomes-son-ean-jacob/ |archive-date=2010-01-30 |access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>  Their fourth child and first daughter was born in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/bo-bice-baby-girl/ |title=Bo Bice Welcomes Baby Girl |date=24 April 2012 |work=Taste of Country}}</ref> They reside in [[Covington, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gocovington.com/Newsroom/newton-countys-newest-resident-bo-bice |title=Newton County's Newest Resident- Bo Bice |publisher=Covington-Newton County Chamber of Commerce |access-date=May 10, 2016 |archive-date=June 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604092628/http://gocovington.com/Newsroom/newton-countys-newest-resident-bo-bice |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On July 31, 2005, Bice broke his foot while performing in concert in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/bo-bice-busts-his-foot-onstage-wbna8790926 |title=Bo Bice busts his foot onstage |work=TODAY.com|date=August 2005 }}</ref> but carried on with the tour. On August 18, Bice, who had been suffering from stomach pain for months, was rushed to the hospital for emergency intestinal surgery to remove a blockage caused by a life-threatening intestinal condition called [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]]. He was sidelined from the tour for several shows. During his absence from the tour, fellow contestants Anwar, Nikko, Scott, Anthony and Constantine paid tribute to Bice by singing "[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]]" and wearing Bo Bice T-shirts.<ref>[http://www.foxesonidol.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article1763.art&page=1 foxes on idol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016204318/http://www.foxesonidol.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article1763.art&page=1 |date=October 16, 2005 }}</ref> Bice returned to the tour for the final two concerts in [[Syracuse, New York]], September 10 and September 11 (a [[benefit concert]] with proceeds going to the [[American Red Cross]] to help victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]). In addition to playing that concert, he opened his home in Helena, Alabama to a family displaced by Hurricane Katrina.

On October 7, 2005, Bice introduced his own band, SugarMoney, in [[Mobile, Alabama]] at [[Bayfest (Mobile)|Bayfest]]. He performed two concerts the following week, including a benefit concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but was back in the hospital the next day with surgery complications. In November Bice was named "Heartland Hero of the Week" on [[John Kasich]]'s show, ''[[Heartland with John Kasich|Heartland]]'', for giving up his house to the family displaced by Hurricane Katrina and for using his music to raise money for victims of Hurricane Katrina. [[Jim Croce]]'s family awarded Bice the "Jim Croce 20th Annual Music Award" because the Croce family had been greatly moved by Bice's performance of Croce's song "Time in a Bottle" while he was a contestant on ''American Idol''.

===''The Real Thing'' and recurring medical problems: 2005–2006===
Bice's solo debut album, ''[[The Real Thing (Bo Bice album)|The Real Thing]]'', was released on December 13, 2005. It opened at number four. ''The Real Thing'' has the seventh-highest opening for a debut album by an ''American Idol'' finalist. Bice's band at the time appears with him on three tracks on ''The Real Thing'''s DualDisc version. In January 2006, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] aired an hour-long TV special—called ''Bo Bice: In the Moment''—which chronicled Bice's life post-Idol during the recording of his album, ''The Real Thing''. Their cameras had followed Bice around for months during the making of his album. The film showed both his joy with making an album and his frustration with recording other people's pop songs. The cameras also captured the birth of his son, Aidan. On December 18, Bice started [[coughing up blood]] while rehearsing for a performance on the 2005 [[Radio Music Awards]], and had to miss the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2005/12/19/bo_bice_out_of_radio_music_awards/7382/ |title=Top News, Latest headlines, Latest News, World News & U.S News |work=United Press International |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151135/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2005/12/19/bo_bice_out_of_radio_music_awards/7382/ |archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref>

In February 2006, Bice kicked off a radio promo tour. During the ensuing year of promotional appearances and touring, Bice continued to suffer with the recurring intestinal condition which had not been repaired by the August 2005 surgery. In the span of just a few months during his various tours, Bice was hospitalized 20 times, checking out of the hospitals each time to honor his performance commitments. In March 2006, Bice sang on the ''American Idol'' Top 16 Results Show. In April 2006, Bice was one of the celebrity drivers featured in the [[Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race]] held in [[Long Beach, California]], that was sponsored by [[Toyota]] to benefit various children's hospitals of Southern California. On September 12, 2006, Bice released a cover of [[The Chambers Brothers]] 1968 smash hit, "[[Time Has Come Today]]", which was the theme song for a new [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] commercial. In September 2006, Bice was a special guest star in a TV special called ''Decades Rock Live: Lynyrd Skynyrd & Friends''—the friends being Bice, [[Hank Williams Jr.]], and [[3 Doors Down]].

On October 5, 2006, Bice underwent emergency surgery in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to correct his recurring intestinal problem. The surgery came after several rounds of tests and doctors deemed his condition serious enough to operate immediately. The day after that surgery, a complication occurred and Bice had to undergo another surgery. During the subsequent recovery time, [[Ben Stiller]] invited Bice to record for the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' produced by Stiller. Bice made several promotional appearances in connection with the releases. Bice was presented with a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] for ''The Real Thing'' not long after [[RCA]] dropped Bice from its roster.

=== Sugar Money Records, ''See The Light'' and ''3'': 2007–2013 ===
In the spring and summer of 2006, Bice began to talk of his hopes for a second CD, saying that "[he]'d like to go more rootsy, more country, more southern rock Bo."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1167395.html |title=seMissourian.com: Entertainment: Banking on Bo (09/08/06) |work=seMissourian.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017223120/http://www.semissourian.com/story/1167395.html |archive-date=2006-10-17}}</ref> Bice encouraged his fans to start a petition asking [[Clive Davis]] for Bo's original southern rock songs on a subsequent CD. The Grassroots Coalition to Hear More Bo started the online Petition to Hear More Bo, which collected over 5,300 signatures before it was closed February 21, 2007, after word broke that Bice was no longer with RCA. Bice subsequently formed his own record label called Sugar Money/StratArt (in partnership with [[Strategic Artist Management]]). He spent the next few months planning, writing, and recording music for his new album, ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]''. Bice introduced many of his newly written songs on a short acoustic tour which began in May 2007 and ended a few weeks later with his hospitalization for flu and bronchitis. ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]'' was released October 23, 2007.

[[File:Bo Bice Share the Beat Atlanta 2008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bice in September 2008]]
In October 2007, Bice made an appearance on the TV show ''[[American Chopper|American Chopper: The Series]]'' in an episode which featured a custom-built Peavey Bike with a built-in guitar, microphone, and amp. [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey Electronics Corporation]] and Bice were working together to develop a Bo Bice guitar for their line of products. Bice had made appearances in Peavey Electronics Corporation's after school programs (in conjunction with National Afterschool Alliance) during which Peavey donated instruments to schools. In February 2008, Bice traveled to [[Kuwait]] and [[Afghanistan]] to perform for U.S. troops deployed in the region, and to thank them for their service. He went back to the war region in Fall 2008. During Spring and Summer 2008, Bice continued his tour promoting his ''See the Light'' album. He simultaneously spent a few weeks participating in a special tour called ''It Was Forty Years Ago Today'' with [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Denny Laine]], [[Lou Gramm]], and [[Christopher Cross]]. The tour paid tribute to the fortieth anniversary of the release of the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

On September 13, Bice participated in "Share the Beat", a benefit for the Georgia Transplant Foundation and the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness. Bice sang two tracks on the ''Brothers of the Southland'' CD,<ref>[http://www.southernfriedmagazine.com/magazine/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=185&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 Southern Fried Magazine'' August 1, 2007]</ref> a compilation spearheaded by [[The Marshall Tucker Band]]'s [[George McCorkle]] who had died from cancer just days prior to the recording sessions. On December 2, Bice was invited to Washington to perform for President Bush. Throughout 2009, Bice continued touring to support ''See the Light''. Bice did tour dates with Lynyrd Skynyrd. Bice was honored with the prestigious Lifetime Presidential Volunteer Service Award for volunteering more than 4,000 hours of his time for worthy causes, such as [[Habitat for Humanity]], Katrina assistance, [[muscular dystrophy]], organ transplants, two concert tours for the military troops in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, Safe House, and many others. In addition to the hours for which he received recognition, he has donated instruments, music equipment, meaningful personal memorabilia, and some of his own paintings to be auctioned off for charities.

Bice started 2010 with an acoustic tour to introduce some newly written songs that he was recording for his upcoming album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Bice's Sugar Money record label cooperated with [[Time Life]] for the album which was called ''3'', which was officially released on [[Saguaro Road Records]] on May 18, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} On October 12, 2010, Bice guest-starred on the syndicated game show ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics!]]'' and won the $50,000 grand prize for his charity, [[MusiCares]]. Bice was the first celebrity contestant to win the grand prize by correctly singing the lyrics to all the songs in his round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2010/10/taylor_hicks_bo_bice_on_dont_f.html |title=Bo Bice, Taylor Hicks to appear on 'Don't Forget the Lyrics' (with videos) |work=AL.com|date=October 12, 2010 }}</ref>

In 2013, Bice sang "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at the [[NASCAR]] [[Feed the Children 300]] in [[Sparta, Kentucky]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Early life==

Cobb was born in [[Americus, Georgia]]<ref name="Hour">{{cite news | last=Evans| first=Brad| title =A chat with singer/songwriter Brent Cobb – Playing Macon Aug. 26| newspaper =[[The 11th Hour (newspaper)|The 11th Hour]]| date =August 24, 2016 | url =http://11thhouronline.com/2016/08/24/a-chat-with-singersongwriter-brent-cobb/| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref> but raised in the nearby town of [[Ellaville, Georgia|Ellaville]].<ref name="Scene"/><ref name="CMT"/> His father, Patrick Cobb, was an appliance repairman who was also in a rock band. Brent made his vocal debut at age 7 when he sang [[Tim McGraw]]'s "[[Don't Take the Girl]]" with his father's band in a [[Richland, Georgia]] festival performance.

As a teenager, Cobb fronted a local band called Mile Marker 5 which had some regional success and opened for larger stars.<ref name="CS">{{cite news | last=DeYoung| first=Bill| title =5 questions: Brent Cobb | newspaper =Connect Savannah| date =January 8, 2013 | url =http://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/5-questions-brent-cobb/Content?oid=2175613| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref> At age 16, Cobb met his cousin, [[Dave Cobb]], at a family funeral.

Dave, along with [[Shooter Jennings]], would later fly Brent to Los Angeles to record his debut album, ''No Place Left to Leave''.<ref name="Scene"/><ref name="BB"/><ref name="Hour"/><ref name="Tenn">{{cite news | last=Melchior| first=Tom| title =How Brent Cobb made it to Nashville| newspaper =[[The Tennessean]]| date =October 28, 2016 | url =http://www.tennessean.com/story/life/entertainment/12th/2016/10/27/how-brent-cobb-made-nashville/92839550/| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref>

==Career==

Cobb recorded his debut album, ''No Place Left to Leave'', in 2006 with his cousin while in Los Angeles. However, after some time in this period, he decided to return to Georgia.

Country star and acquaintance [[Luke Bryan]] suggested Cobb move to [[Nashville]] which, in turn, he eventually did in 2008. Initially, Cobb worked as a photo developer at [[Walgreens]] but eventually managed to negotiate a songwriting contract with Carnival Music Publishing within the year.<ref name="BB"/>

After obtaining his songwriting contract, Cobb then went on to write a variety of songs for many prominent stars, such as Luke Bryan's "Tailgate Blues", [[David Nail]] and [[Frankie Ballard]]'s "Grandpa's Farm", Kellie Pickler's "Rockaway", Kenny Chesney's "Don't It", Miranda Lambert's "Old Sh!t", as well as numerous other performers.<ref name="CMT"/><ref name="Boot"/><ref name="SMN">{{cite news | last=Sickler| first=Linda| title =Georgia songwriter Brent Cobb goes from Willie Nelson to stage of his own| newspaper =[[Savannah Morning News]]| date =January 10, 2013 | url =http://savannahnow.com/do/2013-01-10/georgia-songwriter-brent-cobb-goes-willie-nelson-stage-his-own| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref>

Lyrically, Cobb's songs often detail experiences of rural living in a conversational tone<ref name="Scene"/> and "the influence of his Southern raising is weaved through nearly every note and line."<ref name="WOC">{{cite news | last=Liebig| first=Lorie| title =Brent Cobb's 'Shine On Rainy Day' is the Best Debut Album We've Heard in a Long Time| work =Wide Open Country| date =October 6, 2016 | url =http://www.wideopencountry.com/brent-cobb-shine-on-rainy-day/| accessdate =October 31, 2016}}</ref> Writing for ''Billboard'', Elias Leight noted that Cobb is "a laid back narrator, easygoing even when forlorn."<ref name="BB"/>

CCR disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had quit the band the year before, and John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in lawsuits among the former bandmates. John's disagreements with [[Fantasy Records]] owner [[Saul Zaentz]] led to more court cases and John refused to perform with the two other surviving members of the band &ndash; Tom had died in 1990 &ndash; at Creedence's 1993 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="rockhall.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/creedence-clearwater-revival|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival|publisher=Rockhall.com|access-date=March 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/john-fogerty-explains-creedence-clearwater-revivals-hall-of-fame-meltdown-196247/|title=John Fogerty Explains CCR's Hall of Fame Meltdown|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 6, 2015}}</ref> Though the band has never publicly reunited, John continues to perform CCR songs as part of his solo act, while Cook and Clifford performed as [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] from 1995 to 2020.

==History==
===Early career: The Blue Velvets (1959–1964)===
[[John Fogerty]], [[Doug Clifford]], and [[Stu Cook]] met at Portola Junior High School in [[El Cerrito, California]]. Calling themselves the Blue Velvets, the trio played [[instrumental]]s and "jukebox standards",<ref name=rs30>{{Cite news|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|author-link=Ben Fong-Torres|title=Creedence C'water At the Hop|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|page=9|date=April 5, 1969|issue=30|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/creedence-cwater-at-the-hop-186659/}}</ref> and backed John's older brother [[Tom Fogerty|Tom]] at recordings and performances before he joined the band. The band had also released three singles, the second of which was picked up by [[Casey Kasem]], who worked at KEWB, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. In 1964 they signed with [[Fantasy Records]], an independent jazz label in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/article/fantasy-studios-alive-and-well-in-berkeley.html |title=Fantasy Studios: Alive and Well in Berkeley |publisher=Crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com |date=August 6, 2008 |access-date=March 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009135750/http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/Article/Fantasy-Studios-Alive-and-Well-in-Berkeley.html |archive-date=October 9, 2009}}</ref> The band was attracted to the label after hearing [[Vince Guaraldi]]'s instrumental "[[Cast Your Fate to the Wind]]", which the label had released to national success.<ref name="Lembo">{{cite book |last=Moskowitz |first=David V. |title=The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World p. 166 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4408-0340-6}}</ref>

===Vision and the Golliwogs (1964–1967)===
For the band's first release, Fantasy co-owner Max Weiss renamed the group The Golliwogs (after the children's literary character [[Golliwog]]). Prior to the Golliwog name, Weiss had renamed them Vision. Bandmembers' roles changed during this period: Cook switched from piano to bass guitar and Tom Fogerty from lead vocals to rhythm guitar; John became the band's lead vocalist and primary songwriter. In Tom's words: "I could sing, but John had a sound!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/05/14/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-revival/ |last=Sullivan |first=James |title=John Fogerty Sued for Plagiarizing ...

Both sides of each of the group's first six singles (issued between 1964 and 1966) were credited to the writing team of Wild/Green.  

In 1966, John Fogerty and Doug Clifford were [[Conscription in the United States| drafted into the U.S. armed forces]]; Fogerty joined the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]] while Clifford joined the [[United States Coast Guard Reserve|U.S. Coast Guard Reserve]]. Speaking of his experience in the [[US Army]] Fogerty has said: "I would become delirious and go into a trance. And I started narrating this story to myself, which was the song '[[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|Porterville]]'."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules. I wasn't embarrassed that I was ambitious' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview |work=The Guardian |date=May 29, 2013 |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> John Fogerty eventually took control of the group by singing lead vocals and blossoming into a multi-instrumentalist who played keyboards, harmonica, and saxophone in addition to lead guitar. By 1967, he was [[Record producer|producing]] the group's recordings, although without credit.  The group's final single, "Porterville", failed to chart (like every other Golliwogs recording) but the exact same recording was very shortly thereafter issued as a track by Creedence Clearwater Revival on that group's first album.

===Name change to Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968–1969)===
In 1967, [[Saul Zaentz]] bought Fantasy Records and offered the band a chance to record an album. Having hated the name "The Golliwogs" from day one, the band decided on their own name, Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), which they took in January 1968.<ref name=pc54>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19837/m1/ |title=Show 54 - Hail, Hail, Rock 'N' Roll: Getting back to rock's funky, essential essence. [Part 3]}}</ref> According to interviews with the band members 20 years later, the name's elements came from three sources: Tom Fogerty's friend Credence Newball, whose name they changed to form the word ''Creedence'' (as in [[creed]]);  a television commercial for [[Olympia Brewing Company]] ("clear water"); and the four members' renewed commitment to their band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.comhttp//arch-timesmachine-fe-prd-40741-2-575473780.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/timesmachine/1995/10/15/060380.html?pageNumber=236|title=MUSIC MUSIC;The Rolling, Uh, Pebbles?|access-date=June 19, 2023|website=Timesmachine.nytimes.com}}</ref> Rejected contenders for the band's name included "Muddy Rabbit", "[[Gossamer Wump]]", and "Creedence Nuball and the Ruby"; however, the last was the starting point from which the band derived their final name. Cook described the name as "weirder than [[Buffalo Springfield]] or [[Jefferson Airplane]]".<ref name="isbn"/> In early 1968, the band began appearing regularly at local [[San Francisco]] area clubs and venues including [[Deno and Carlo's]], the [[Avalon Ballroom]], and the [[Fillmore West]]. Later that year, the band began touring nationally across the US and made their first appearances in [[New York City]] at the [[Fillmore East]].

By 1968, [[AM radio]] programmers around the U.S. took note when CCR's [[cover version|cover]] of the 1956 [[rockabilly]] song<ref name=pc54/> "[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]" received substantial airplay in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and on [[Chicago]]'s [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/il/wls101468.htm|title= WLS890 Hit Parade|work=Mike Gallant|date=1968-10-14|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> It was the band's second single, its first to reach the [[Top 40]] (No. 11), and its only Top 40 hit not written by John Fogerty. Two other singles were released from their May 1968 debut self titled album: a cover of [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]]'s "[[I Put a Spell on You]]" (No. 58) and "Porterville" (released on the Scorpio label with writing credited to "T. Spicebush Swallowtail"), written during Fogerty's time in the Army Reserve.

=== Peak success: 1969–1970 ===
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival performing on stage at the Forum.jpg|thumb|CCR in concert in [[Inglewood, California]], December 1969]]
After their breakthrough, CCR began touring and started work on their second album, ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]'' (released January 1969), at [[RCA]] Studios in Los Angeles. A No.&nbsp;7 platinum hit, the record was their first in a string of hit albums and singles that continued uninterrupted for two years. The single "[[Proud Mary]]", backed with "[[Born on the Bayou]]", reached No.&nbsp;2 on the national ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart. The former would eventually become the group's most-covered song, with some 100 versions by other artists to date, including the No. 4 1971 hit by [[Ike & Tina Turner]], two years to the week after the original peaked. John cites this song as being the result of high spirits on gaining his discharge from the Army Reserve.<ref name=pc54/> The album also featured a cover of the rock & roll classic "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]"<ref name=pc54/> and the band's nine-minute live-show closer, "Keep On Chooglin{{'"}}.

Months later, during April 1969, "[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]" backed with "[[Lodi (Creedence Clearwater Revival song)|Lodi]]", was released and peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in the US. In the United Kingdom, "Bad Moon Rising" spent three weeks at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] during September and October 1969, becoming the band's only number one single in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popexpresso.com/2018/09/19/creedence-clearwater-revival-scored-their-only-u-k-no-1-single-with-bad-moon-rising|title = Creedence Clearwater Revival scored their only U.K. No 1 single with "Bad Moon Rising|work = Pop Expresso| date=September 18, 2023 }}</ref> The band's third album, ''[[Green River (album)|Green River]]'', followed in August 1969, was their first album to top the [[Billboard 200]], and went gold along with the single "[[Green River (song)|Green River]]", which again reached No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard charts. The B-side of "Green River", "[[Commotion (song)|Commotion]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;30 and the band's emphasis on covers of their old favorites continued with "[[Night Time Is the Right Time]]". CCR continued to tour constantly with performances in July 1969 at the [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta Pop Festival]] and in August 1969 at the [[Woodstock Festival]]. Their set was not included in the [[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock film]] or soundtrack because John felt the band's performance was subpar. Four tracks from the event (out of a total of eleven) were eventually included in the 1994 commemorative box set ''[[Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music#Disc two|Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music]]''. Cook, however, held an opposing view, saying, "The performances are classic CCR and I'm still amazed by the number of people who don't even know we were one of the headliners at Woodstock '69."<ref name="Woodstock quote">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&q=I%27m+still+amazed+by+the+number+of+people+who+don%27t+even+know+we+were+one+of+the+headliners+at+Woodstock+%2769&pg=PA65|title=The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival Page 65|author=Hank Bordowitz|publisher= Chicago Review Press, Incorporated|location=Chicago, Illinois|year=2007|page=65|isbn=978-1-55652-661-9|access-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref> John later complained the act that preceded them, the [[Grateful Dead]], had put the audience to sleep; as John scanned the audience he saw a "[[Dante's Inferno|Dante]] scene, just bodies from hell, all intertwined and asleep, covered with mud".<ref name="isbn">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&pg=PA64 |title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival |author=Hank Bordowitz |publisher=Chicago Review Press, Incorporated |location=Chicago, Illinois |year=2007 |page=64 |isbn=978-1-55652-661-9 |access-date=August 27, 2011}}</ref>

{{Blockquote|Creedence Clearwater Revival ... were progressive and anachronistic at the same time. An unapologetic throwback to the golden era of rock and roll, they broke ranks with their peers on the progressive, psychedelic San Francisco scene. Their approach was basic and uncompromising, holding true to the band members' working-class origins. The term "roots rock" had not yet been invented when Creedence came along, but in essence, they defined it, drawing inspiration from the likes of [[Little Richard]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chuck Berry]], and the artisans of soul at [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]]. In so doing, Creedence Clearwater Revival became the standard bearers and foremost celebrants of homegrown American music.

After Woodstock, CCR were busy honing material for a fourth album, ''[[Willy and the Poor Boys]]'', their second top 3 LP, released in November 1969. "[[Down on the Corner]]" and "[[Fortunate Son]]", both of which they performed on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on November 16, 1969,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/the-ed-sullivan-show/creedence-clearwater-revival---jerry-lee-lewis/episode/106884/summary.html|title=The Ed Sullivan Show: Creedence Clearwater Revival / Jerry Lee Lewis|publisher=TV.com|access-date=May 8, 2009|archive-date=June 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604114924/http://www.tv.com/the-ed-sullivan-show/creedence-clearwater-revival---jerry-lee-lewis/episode/106884/summary.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> climbed to No.&nbsp;3 and No.&nbsp;14, respectively, by year's end.  The album was CCR in standard mode, featuring Fogerty originals and two reworked [[Lead Belly]] covers, "[[Cotton Fields]]" and "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]".  The year 1969 had been a remarkable chart year for the band:  three Top Ten albums, four hit singles (three charting at No.&nbsp;2 and one at No.&nbsp;3) with three additional charting [[B-side]]s.

CCR released another double A-side hit, "[[Travelin' Band]]"/"[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]", in January 1970. The speedy "Travelin' Band", with a strong Little Richard sound, however, bore enough similarities to "Good Golly, Miss Molly" to warrant a lawsuit by the song's publisher; it was eventually [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] out of court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1971-john-fogerty-is-sued-by-the-owners-of-specialty-records-their-suit-accuses/ |title=Rock History - 1971 – John Fogerty is sued by the owners of Specialty Records. |publisher=Thisdayinrock.com |date=October 14, 1971 |access-date=October 24, 2013 |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016232331/http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1971-john-fogerty-is-sued-by-the-owners-of-specialty-records-their-suit-accuses/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The song ultimately topped out at No.&nbsp;2. The band also recorded its January 31, 1970, live performance at the [[Oakland Coliseum Arena]], which would later be marketed as a live album and television special. In February, CCR were featured on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', although only John was interviewed in the accompanying article.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/creedenceclearwaterrevival/photos/collection/photo/1 |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival Photo Gallery : Rolling Stone |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=February 21, 1970 |access-date=May 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412090626/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/creedenceclearwaterrevival/photos/collection/photo/1 |archive-date=April 12, 2009}}</ref>

In April 1970, CCR were set to begin their first European tour. To support the upcoming live dates, John wrote "[[Up Around the Bend]]" and "[[Run Through the Jungle]]"; the single reached No.&nbsp;4 that spring. The band returned to [[Wally Heider Studios]] in San Francisco in June to record ''[[Cosmo's Factory]]''. The album contained the earlier Top 10 hits "Travelin' Band" and "Up Around the Bend" plus popular album tracks such as the opener "Ramble Tamble".

''Cosmo's Factory'' was released in July 1970, and it was number one in the US for nine weeks. It was released along with the band's fifth and final No.&nbsp;2 national hit, "[[Lookin' Out My Back Door]]"/"[[Long as I Can See the Light]]". Although they topped some international charts and local radio countdowns, CCR have the distinction of having had five No.&nbsp;2 singles without ever having had a No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Hot 100]], the most of any group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/specials/hot100/charts/most-no2s-wo1s.shtml |title=Most No.&nbsp;2 Hits Without Reaching No.&nbsp;1 By Artist |work=[[Billboard Magazine]] |format=PHP |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228031342/http://www.billboard.com/specials/hot100/charts/most-no2s-wo1s.shtml |archive-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref> Their five No.&nbsp;2 singles [[Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-two singles|were exceeded]] only by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (six), [[Taylor Swift]] (seven), and [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] (nine), and tied with [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Carpenters]].  Conversely, on station WLS-AM the band had three No.&nbsp;1's, four No.&nbsp;3's, and two No.&nbsp;4's, but no No.&nbsp;2 singles, with "Down on the Corner" the only top ten CCR single registering the same peak position (No.&nbsp;3) on the Hot 100 and on WLS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/il/wlsyear.htm|title=WLS Year Index|publisher=Oldiesloon|date=1969–1971|access-date=December 26, 2011}}</ref>

Other cuts on the ''Cosmo's Factory'' album included an 11-minute jam of [[Marvin Gaye]]’s 1968 cover of "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" (a minor hit when an edited version was released as a single in 1976), and a nearly note-for-note homage to [[Roy Orbison]]'s "Ooby Dooby". The album was their biggest seller, going to No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 album charts and No.&nbsp;11 on ''Billboard's'' Soul Albums chart.

''[[Pendulum (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|Pendulum]]'', released in December 1970, was another top seller, spawning a Top 10 hit with "[[Have You Ever Seen The Rain?]]" John played the [[Hammond organ|Hammond B3 organ]] on many of the ''Pendulum'' tracks, notably in "Have You Ever Seen The Rain?", in recognition of the deep respect and influence of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], with whom the members of the band had jammed. The single's flip side, "Hey Tonight", was also a hit.

=== Tom Fogerty's departure, discord and breakup: 1971–1972 ===

[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival.jpg|thumb|CCR in 1972 after Tom Fogerty's departure; John Fogerty, Stu Cook, Doug Clifford]]

Around this time, an overwhelming perception among the other band members that John was being overly controlling and domineering was approaching a boiling point.<ref name= "Autobiography">Fogerty, John (2015). ''Fortunate Son''. New York, NY: Little, Brown and Company.</ref> Tom Fogerty decided he had enough and resigned from CCR in early 1971 after the recording of ''Pendulum'', with his departure being made public in February of that year. The remaining members initially considered replacing him but ultimately continued as a trio.

In the spring of 1971, John Fogerty, frustrated with his remaining bandmates' constant complaining that they were not allowed to write and produce their own songs,<ref name= "Autobiography"/> relented and informed Cook and Clifford that CCR would continue only by adopting a "democratic" approach: each member would now write and perform his own material with each band member contributing three songs apiece to the next album. Fogerty would only contribute guitar parts to his bandmates' songs. <ref name= "Autobiography"/>

There are conflicting views regarding Cook and Clifford's reaction to this proposed new arrangement, although everyone seemed to acknowledge that Cook and Clifford had wanted more input in CCR's artistic and business decisions. For his part, Fogerty recounts that Cook and Clifford were initially excited about this new opportunity to write and perform their own songs free of his meddling, since they had been the ones who asked for it in the first place and they only soured on the concept after the record's lack of success (Fogerty also mentions a time while recording the album when he refused Cook's request to "fix" one of his (Cook's) songs to make it sound more like other Creedence material, which may have also played a role in the band members' attitudes toward the project). <ref name= "Autobiography"/> However, other sources imply that Cook and Clifford were resistant to this approach from the start. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |access-date= February 13, 2022}}</ref> Allegedly, Fogerty at one point insisted they accept the arrangement or he would quit the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival – the full story, by John Fogerty, Stu Cook and Doug Clifford |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/creedence-clearwater-revival-the-full-story-by-john-fogerty-stu-cook-and-doug-clifford-6563/ |website=UNCUT |access-date=25 December 2023 |date=18 July 2014}}</ref> Despite the conflict, the trio put its new work ethic to the test in the studio, releasing the Top 10 single "[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]" in July 1971, backed with Cook's "Door To Door". The band toured both the U.S. and Europe that summer and fall with Cook's song a part of the live set. In spite of their continuing commercial success, relations among the three had become increasingly strained.

The band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', was released in April 1972, featuring songs written by John Fogerty, Cook and Clifford, as well as a cover of "[[Hello Mary Lou]]" (a song [[Gene Pitney]] had originally written for [[Ricky Nelson]]). Each member sang lead vocal on the songs written by that member. The album was a critical failure, considered by critics to be of inconsistent quality and lacking in cohesion. ''Rolling Stone'' reviewer [[Jon Landau]] deemed it "relative to a group's established level of performance, the worst album I have ever heard from a major rock band".<ref name="landau-review">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/mardi-gras-19760526 |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival: ''Mardi Gras'': Music Reviews: Rolling Stone |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 1972|access-date=May 8, 2009}}</ref> The sales of ''Mardi Gras'' were weaker than previous albums, ultimately peaking at No.&nbsp;12, though it still became the band's seventh consecutive studio album to be certified Gold. Fogerty's "[[Someday Never Comes]]", backed with Clifford's "Tearin' Up the Country", also cracked the U.S. Top 40.

By this point, Fogerty was not only at direct odds with his bandmates but he had also come to see the group's relationship with Fantasy Records as onerous, feeling that Zaentz had reneged on his promise to give the band a better contract. Cook&mdash;who held a degree in business&mdash;claimed that because of poor judgment on Fogerty's part, CCR had to abide by the worst record deal of any major U.S. recording artist. Despite the relatively poor reception of ''Mardi Gras'' and deteriorated relationships among the remaining band members, CCR embarked upon a two-month, 20-date U.S. tour. However, on October 16, 1972—less than six months after the tour ended—Fantasy Records and the band officially announced its disbanding.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7A4EAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7A4EAAAAMBAJ/page/n62 16]|quote=creedence splits.|title=Billboard –|via=[[Internet Archive]]|date=October 28, 1972|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|access-date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> CCR never formally reunited after the breakup, although Cook and Clifford eventually started the band [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]]. John Fogerty later commented on the demise of CCR in a 1997 edition of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] magazine ''Pop'':

{{blockquote|I was alone when I made that [CCR] music. I was alone when I made the arrangements, I was alone when I added background vocals, guitars and some other stuff. I was alone when I produced and mixed the albums. The other guys showed up only for rehearsals and the days we made the actual recordings. For me Creedence was like sitting on a time bomb. We'd had decent successes with our cover of "Susie Q" and with [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|the first album]], when we went into the studio to cut "Proud Mary." It was the first time we were in a real Hollywood studio, RCA's Los Angeles studio, and the problems started immediately. The other guys in the band insisted on writing songs for the new album, they had opinions on the arrangements, they wanted to sing. They went as far as adding background vocals to "Proud Mary," and it sounded awful. They used [[tambourine]]s, and it sounded no better.

That's when I understood I had a choice to make. At that point in time we were just a one hit wonder, and "Susie Q" hadn't really been that big a hit. Either this [the new album] would be a success, something really big, or we might as well start working at the car wash again. There was a big row. We went to an Italian restaurant and I remember that I very clearly told the others that I for one didn't want to go back to the car wash again. Now we had to make the best possible album and it wasn't important who did what, as long as the result was the very best we could achieve. And of course I was the one who should do it. I don't think the others really understood what I meant, but at least I could manage the situation the way I wanted. The result was eight million-selling double-sided singles in a row and six albums, who all went platinum. And ''[[Melody Maker]]'' had us as the best band in the world. That was after [[break-up of the Beatles|the Beatles split]], but still. ... And I was the one who had created all this. Despite that, I don't think they understood what I was talking about. ... They were obsessed with the idea of more control and more influence. So finally the bomb exploded and we never worked together again.<ref name="1997-98Interviews">{{cite web|url=http://riverising.tripod.com/john-bluemoonswamp/bmsinterviews.html?stop_mobi=yes|title=Blue Moon Swamp Interview|work=POP |year=1997|access-date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

===John Fogerty===
[[File:John Fogerty at the 2011 Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest.jpg|upright|thumb|John Fogerty performing in 2011]]
In 1973, John Fogerty began his solo career with ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'', his one-man band collection of country and gospel songs. Under his old CCR contract, however, Fogerty owed Fantasy eight more records. In the end, he refused to work for the label. The impasse was resolved only when [[Asylum Records]]' [[David Geffen]] bought Fogerty's contract for $1 million. In 1975 he released his only Asylum album, the self-titled ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]''. His next major hit was ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', a chart-topping success in 1985. On tour in 1986, however, Fogerty suffered complaints over his steadfast refusal to perform CCR songs and suffered with recurring vocal problems which he blamed on having to testify in court. Fogerty's explanation for not playing CCR material was that he would have had to pay performance royalties to copyright holder Zaentz, and that it was "too painful" to revisit the music of his past.

With the ''Centerfield'' album, Fogerty also found himself entangled in new, tit-for-tat lawsuits with Zaentz over the song "[[The Old Man Down The Road]]" which was, according to Zaentz, a blatant re-write of Fogerty's own 1970 CCR hit "Run Through the Jungle". Since Fogerty had traded his rights to CCR's songs in 1980 to cancel his remaining contractual obligations, Fantasy now owned the rights to "Run Through the Jungle" and sued Fogerty essentially for [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] himself. While a jury ruled in Fogerty's favor, he did settle a [[defamation]] suit filed by Zaentz over the songs "Mr. Greed" and "Zanz Kant Danz". Fogerty was forced to edit the recording, changing the "Zanz" reference to "Vanz".

On February 19, 1987, at the [[Palomino Club (North Hollywood)|Palomino Club]] ([[North Hollywood]]) in Los Angeles, Fogerty broke his self-imposed ban on performing CCR hits. [[Bob Dylan]] and [[George Harrison]] (along with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Jesse Ed Davis]]) had joined him onstage, admonishing, "If you don't, the whole world's gonna think 'Proud Mary' is [[Tina Turner]]'s song." At a 1987 [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] benefit concert for Vietnam veterans, Fogerty finally ran through the list of CCR hits, beginning with "Born on the Bayou" and ending with "Proud Mary". In 1986 he also released his second Warner Bros. album, ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]''. Fogerty retreated from music again in the late 1980s but returned in 1997 with the [[Grammy]]-winning ''[[Blue Moon Swamp]]''. Fogerty still tours frequently and now performs CCR classics alongside his solo material.

===Tom Fogerty===
Tom Fogerty released several solo albums, though none reached the success of CCR. His 1974 solo album ''[[Zephyr National]]'' was the last to feature the four original CCR band members on the track "Mystic Isle of Avalon", although John recorded his parts separately. Several tracks sound very much like the CCR style, particularly the aptly titled "Joyful Resurrection". His album ''Excalibur'' featured all four members of The Jerry Garcia Band (who recorded live albums for Fantasy)... Garcia played lead guitar to Tom's rhythm guitar, and has since become a popular cult album.

Tom Fogerty died at his home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in September 1990 of an [[AIDS]] complication, which he contracted via a tainted blood transfusion he received while undergoing back surgery. Tom and John barely reconciled before Tom's death, and in the [[eulogy]] that he delivered at Tom's funeral, John said, "We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview|title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules.

===Stu Cook and Doug Clifford===
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revisited in concert @ Utah (May 29).jpg|alt=|thumb|CCR's rhythm section formed [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] in 1995]]
Junior high school friends Doug Clifford and Stu Cook continued to work together following the demise of CCR both as session players and members of the [[Don Harrison Band]]. They also founded Factory Productions, a mobile recording service in the Bay Area. Clifford released a solo record, ''[[Cosmo (Doug Clifford album)|Cosmo]]'', in 1972. Cook produced artist [[Roky Erickson]]'s ''The Evil One'' and was a bassist with the popular country act [[Southern Pacific (band)|Southern Pacific]] in the 1980s.

Clifford also produced ''Groovers Paradise'' for former [[Sir Douglas Quintet]] and Texas Tornados frontman [[Doug Sahm]]. Both Clifford and Cook played on the album which was released on Warner Bros. in 1974. Clifford continued to perform and record with Sahm through the 1980s.

Following a relatively long period of musical inactivity, Cook and Clifford formed [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] in 1995 with several well-known musicians. Revisited continues to tour globally performing the original band's classics. John's 1997 injunction forced Creedence Clearwater Revisited to temporarily change its name to "Cosmo's Factory", but the courts later ruled in Cook's and Clifford's favor.

===Fantasy Records===
After CCR, Fantasy Records released several greatest-hits packages such as 1972's ''[[Creedence Gold]]'', 1973's ''[[More Creedence Gold]]'' and 1975's ''[[Pre-Creedence]]'', a compilation album of the Golliwogs' early recordings. Fantasy also released the highly successful double album ''[[Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits|Chronicle]]'', a collection of Creedence's twenty hit singles, in 1976. Several years later, the label released a live recording entitled ''The Royal Albert Hall Concert''. Contrary to its title, the 1970 performance was recorded in [[Oakland, California]], not at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]]. Subsequent issues of the original 1981 album have been retitled simply ''[[The Concert (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|The Concert]]''. Another double album of their best material was issued in 1986 as ''[[Chronicle: Volume Two]]''.

The success of CCR made Fantasy and Zaentz a great deal of money, and Fantasy built a new headquarters building in 1971 at 2600 Tenth Street in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warehamproperties.com/press/musichistory.htm|title=Wareham Development|publisher=Warehamproperties.com|date=February 13, 2007|access-date=May 8, 2009|archive-date=July 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725094129/http://www.warehamproperties.com/press/musichistory.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> Zaentz also used his wealth to produce a number of successful films, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]] winners ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.

In 2004, Zaentz sold Fantasy to [[Concord Records]]. John Fogerty then purchased from Concord a majority stake in the global rights to the Creedence Clearwater Revival songs he had written.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Millman |first1=Ethan |title=Five Decades Later, John Fogerty Finally Gains Ownership of CCR Catalog |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/john-fogerty-ccr-songs-deal-1234659981/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=12 January 2023}}</ref> In 2005, the label released ''[[The Long Road Home (album)|The Long Road Home]]'', a collection of CCR and Fogerty solo classics. After ''[[Revival (John Fogerty album)|Revival]]'' came out on the Fantasy label in October 2007 but before his following album ''[[Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]'' (a sequel to his 1973 album) was issued in 2009, Fogerty switched from Fantasy to his own label, Fortunate Son Records, distributed by [[Verve Forecast Records]].

=== Reunions ===
The original CCR lineup reunited just once for a performance after their breakup, at Tom Fogerty's wedding on October 19, 1980. Six years prior, all four members were present on the song "Mystic Aisle Avalon" on Tom's 1974 album ''[[Zephyr National]]'', but John recorded his parts separately from everyone else. John, Cook, and Clifford played at their 20th [[El Cerrito High School]] reunion in 1983, but as their original incarnation, the Blue Velvets. In the 1980s and 1990s, new rounds of lawsuits between the band members, as well as against their former management, deepened their animosities. By the time CCR was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993, John refused to perform with Cook and Clifford. The pair were barred from the stage, while John played with an all-star band that included [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]]. Tom's widow Tricia had expected a CCR reunion and even brought the urn containing her husband's ashes to the ceremony. Furious, Cook and Clifford, who were seated with their families at a table across the room from Fogerty's, walked out of the ballroom just as the performance began, and would later write separate letters to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's board of directors, saying it was "hurtful" and "insulting" to allow the performance to continue without them.<ref name="latimesarticle">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-01-31-ca-868-story.html|title=These Guys' Bad Moon Rose a Loooong Time Ago|date=January 31, 1993|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 11, 2021}}</ref>

In a July 2011 interview with the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', John admitted that he would at least be willing to consider reuniting with Cook and Clifford:

{{blockquote|Years ago, I looked at people and I was so full of some sort of emotion and I'd say, 'Absolutely not!' ... But I have to admit, people have asked me more recently, and even though I have no idea how such a series of events would come to pass, I can tell that there isn't the bombast in my voice, in the denial, in the refusal. It's more like, 'Well, I dunno.' Never say never is I guess is what people tell you. In this life, all kinds of strange things come to pass. Realizing that it doesn't really kick up a big firestorm of emotion, it kind of suggests that at least if someone started talking I'd sit still long enough to listen.<ref name="heraldarticle">{{cite news|url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Fortunate/5082408/story.html |title=Fortunate son |newspaper=Calgary Herald |date=July 11, 2011 |access-date=July 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715020625/http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Fortunate/5082408/story.html |archive-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref>}}

When asked again in October 2011 about the prospect of a reunion, he said: "I'm saying it's possible, yeah. I think the call [laughs] would maybe have to come from outside the realm. Somebody would have to get me to look at things in a fresh way."<ref name="rollingstonearticle">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/john-fogerty-my-anger-towards-creedence-bandmates-has-faded-20111025?stop_mobi=yes|title=John Fogerty: My Anger Towards Creedence Bandmates Has Faded|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 25, 2011|access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> However, Cook and Clifford both stated in the February 2012 edition of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine that they are not interested in a CCR reunion. "Leopards don't change their spots. This is just an image-polishing exercise by John. My phone certainly hasn't rung", Cook said. Added Clifford: "It might have been a nice idea twenty years ago, but it's too late."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2012/01/03/creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion/ |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival Reunion: No Chance, Drummer and Bassist Say |publisher=Spinner |date=January 3, 2012 |access-date=January 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411204945/http://www.spinner.com/2012/01/03/creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion/ |archive-date=April 11, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, Fogerty once again said he would be open to a reunion, but he does not see Cook and Clifford being willing to change their stance. He told [[Charlie Rose]] on ''[[CBS This Morning]]'': "From time to time, I'll say something and it'll get in print that maybe that will happen, and then immediately I'll hear back stuff that doesn't sound like it's possible... I think it's a possibility in the future, you know. It's not something I'm actively seeking, but I'm not totally against the idea either."<ref name="CBS This Morning">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion-a-possibility/|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival reunion a possibility|publisher=John Fogerty: Creedence Clearwater Revival reunion a possibility|date=May 20, 2013|access-date=December 29, 2023}}</ref> In September 2017 Clifford again ruled out any chance of Cook and himself reuniting with John, restating, "It would have been great twenty, twenty-five years ago.

Of particular interest was the use of his protest song "Fortunate Son" in a [[blue jeans]] commercial.<ref name=aintme/> In this case, the advertiser eventually stopped using the song, as Fogerty related in a later interview:

'''Cross Canadian Ragweed''' was an American rock band formed in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]] in 1994. The band consisted of [[Cody Canada]] (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), [[Randy Ragsdale]] (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released five studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010.

==History==
===Formation===
Cross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale met Cody Canada, Matt Weidemann, and Grady Cross, who had also been playing together. The four had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale's home seven nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale's father, Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member's last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Matt Weidemann left the band, and Jeremy Plato joined the band, playing the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the [[College Town]] of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], where acts like Mike McClure's [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]] and singer-songwriter [[Jimmy LaFave]] had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/north_austin_stillwater_ok_nickname/|title=Barry Popik|website=Barrypopik.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>

===''Carney'' and ''Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon''===
The group had already received significant [[college radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] before it released its first album, ''Carney'' in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base's passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released ''Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon'' in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene.

===''Highway 377''===
Ragweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into [[Texas]], where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song "Long Way Home" was featured on several [[Dodge]] Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale's father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track "Johnny's Song."

===''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas''===
In 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album ''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas'' in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off ''Carney'' and ''Highway 377'', with a handful of cover songs.

===''Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)''===
In 2002, the group then signed with [[Show Dog Nashville|Universal South]] Records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as 'The Purple Album'.  It was a tribute to the band's "little sister" Mandy Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band's drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near [[College Station, Texas]], and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles "17" and the ballad "Constantly", and released a music video for the hard rock track "Don't Need You."

===''Soul Gravy''===
Ragweed's 2004 album, ''[[Soul Gravy]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard charts. [[Lee Ann Womack]] provided background vocals on the popular single "Sick and Tired". The project also saw the re-release of the song "Alabama" (off of 2001's Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]] as well.

===''Garage''===
In October 2005 the band released ''Garage'', described by both the band and raters at [[AllMusic]] as the group's "grungiest album ever." Two songs, "Fighting' For" and "This Time Around" both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States due to the song "Dimebag", a tribute to former [[Damageplan]] and [[Pantera]] guitarist "Dimebag" [[Darrell Abbott]], who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall.

===''Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain's Ballroom''===
In late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, ''Live and Loud At Cain's Ballroom'' in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The band's 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as [[Neil Young]]'s [[The Needle and the Damage Done]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]]'s "Lonely Feeling."

===''Mission California''===
Cross Canadian Ragweed recorded ''[[Mission California]]'', their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in [[San Diego]], California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. [[Lee Ann Womack]] once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] cover "Cry Lonely." ''[[Mission California]]'' was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was "name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock."

===''Happiness and All the Other Things''===
The band's tenth and final album, ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled "51 Pieces", which Canada penned with Micky Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the [[House of Blues]]. It also featured "Blue Bonnets" which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke ([[Willie Nelson]]'s long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were "To Find My Love", "Burn Like The Sun", and "Kick In The Head."

=== Hiatus and band break-up ===
In May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring.  In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, "Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He's 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home." Despite Ragsdale wanting to "get another drummer and press on," Canada stated "We’ve always said from the start, we’re Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all."<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cross Canadian Ragweed cancels Oklahoma City Family Jam  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701165713/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |archive-date=July 1, 2012  }}</ref> In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their  "Last Call Show" in October 2010 at Joe's Bar in Chicago, IL, stating "as far as that’s concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/news/2010/sep/16/cross-canadian-ragweed-frontmans-career-evolves/|title=Cross Canadian Ragweed frontman's career evolves|website=Caller.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>

=== Post break-up ===
Since Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed [[The Departed (band)|The Departed]] with fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]]-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album "This Is Indian Land" in June 2011.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cody Canada & The Departed digging into red dirt roots with debut album, "This Is Indian Land"  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707211521/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |archive-date=July 7, 2012  }}</ref>
Ragsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon. Ragsdale played with Stoney LaRue until 2013 and now works in the oil and natural gas industry, while Cross purchased and operates the bar that was the very first venue Cross Canadian Ragweed performed in 1994.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Local musician puts family first with new business  |url=http://www.mustangpaper.com/v2/content.aspx?module=ContentItem&ID=186897&MemberID=1586  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317125018/http://www.mustangpaper.com/v2/content.aspx?module=ContentItem&ID=186897&MemberID=1586  |url-status=dead  |archive-date=March 17, 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oklahoman.com/story/entertainment/2011/07/07/fomer-cross-canadian-ragweed-rocker-returns-to-his-roots-with-opening-of-yukon-pub/61151918007/|title={{as written|Fomer}} Cross Canadian Ragweed rocker returns to his roots with opening of Yukon pub|date=July 7, 2011|website=Oklahoman.com|access-date=August 12, 2024}}</ref>

In 2019 Grady Cross and Randy Ragsdale joined singer-songwriter Jason Young to form the band Cross Rags and Young.

==Influences and sound==
The band was influenced by [[grunge]], [[alternative rock]] of the 1990s along with early [[southern rock]] acts as well as [[outlaw country]]. Canada said that rock bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Soundgarden]] all were a part of the influence on the band's sound as well as country music influences [[Merle Haggard]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Robert Earl Keen]], in addition to southern rockers [[Marshall Tucker Band]], and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], among others. Due to their unique sound, the band often had a hard time getting radio airplay on either mainstream rock or country stations.

==Notable appearances==
The band frequently played with other stars of the [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] and Texas Music scene including [[Stoney Larue]], [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers]], [[Micky & The Motorcars]], [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly]], (Canada's brother-in-law) [[Wade Bowen]], [[No Justice]], Johnny Cooper, Seth James, and [[Brandon Rhyder]].

The band played with country music star [[Dierks Bentley]] numerous times. Bentley referenced the band in his song "[[Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)]]", singing that "Ragweed's rockin' on the radio".

[[Minnesota Twins]] [[catcher]] [[Ryan Doumit]] comes to bat to their song "Alabama".

"Cry Lonely" is a playable track in ''[[Rock Band Country Track Pack]]''.

The song "Boys from Oklahoma" plays as the credits roll in the movie [[Leaves of Grass (film)|Leaves of Grass]] starring [[Edward Norton]] and [[Susan Sarandon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1151359/soundtrack|title=Leaves of Grass (2009) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref> The film is a Stoner Comedy set in Oklahoma.

"Anywhere But Here" is played during the Season 2 Episode 6 of the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]''.

'''Crossin Dixon''' is an American [[country music]] and [[Southern rock]] group signed to the independent [[Broken Bow Records|Stoney Creek Records]] label. It was founded by Jason Miller (vocals), Michael Bole, Brandon Hyde and Charlie Grantham.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p972084|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Crossin Dixon > Biography ))) |accessdate=2007-12-13 |last=Leahey |first=Andrew |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> They have released three singles, of which two have charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts.

==Biography==
The four members of Crossin Dixon first performed together in 2002. Originally, they assumed the name Kyote Wylde, but after developing a significant fanbase, the band changed its name to Crossin Dixon in 2004, to reflect their widespread touring.<ref name="allmusic"/> The band was recommended to record producer [[Michael Knox (record producer)|Michael Knox]], who had also worked with [[Jason Aldean]], and by 2006, Crossin Dixon was signed to [[Broken Bow Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Their first single, entitled "Guitar Slinger", was released to radio in July 2007; both it and the followup, "Make You Mine", charted on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts that year. They released a third single, "I Love My Old Bird Dog (& I Love You Too)" in 2008, but the single failed to chart.  Their self-titled debut was released digitally on December 16, 2008. They released a single called "Lovin in the Country" to radio and  on August 31, 2010, as the first single for an upcoming, untitled second album. A new single, "Goodbye to Henry", was released on December 6, 2010, but it failed to chart. 

Crossin Dixon took a brief hiatus in 2012 following the announcement of former singer, Jason Miller, to pursue a solo career. After careful thought and consideration for their fans, the two remaining members of Crossin Dixon, Brandon Hyde and Charlie Grantham, decided they would continue their tour starting in January 2013. The band broke up sometime in 2015, without making much noise or a formal announcement.

'''Forrest Richard Betts''' (December 12, 1943 – April 18, 2024) was an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, composer and founding member of [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. He initially shared the band's signature dual [[lead guitar]] roles with band founder [[Duane Allman]], and assumed the solo lead after Allman's death in October of 1971.  As both a singer and composer as well, he was central to the group's greatest commercial success in the mid-1970s and was the writer and vocalist on the Allmans' hit single "[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]". 

Early in his career Betts was best noted for collaboration with Duane Allman,<ref name=Tdrozodowski>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|title=Come and Go Blues: The Incredible Guitarists of the Allman Brothers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126202416/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|archive-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> the twosome introducing melodic twin guitar harmony and counterpoint, which, according to ''Guitar World'' "rewrote the rules for how two rock guitarists can work together, completely scrapping the traditional rhythm/lead roles to stand toe to toe".<ref name="GW July 2009">{{cite magazine|title=The Allman Brothers Band: The Road Goes on Forever|magazine=Guitar World|date=July 20, 2009|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202053024/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|archive-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref> Betts initially gained renown for his epic [[instrumental]], "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]", from the Band's second album, ''[[Idlewild South]]'', followed by his striking guitar duet-driven "[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]", which not only was his first band vocal but signaled a dramatic new sound and potential direction for it.  

In the wake of Duane's death the group indeed followed both Betts' musical direction and band leadership, exploding into commercial success in 1973 upon the introduction of the [[Country music|Country]]-influenced ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', and the chart success of its catchy Betts-written hits, exuberant "Ramblin' Man" and the melodic instrumental "[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]".

The band went through a hiatus in the late 1970s, during which time Betts, like many of the other band members, pursued a solo career and side projects under such names as Great Southern and The Dickey Betts Band.  The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979, with [[Dan Toler]] taking the second guitar role alongside Betts.  In 1982, it broke up a second time, during which break Betts formed the group [[Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks]], which lasted until 1984.  A third reformation occurred in 1989, with [[Warren Haynes]] then joining Betts on guitar. 

Betts was ousted from the band in 2000 over a conflict regarding his continued drug and alcohol abuse; he never played with them again, nor would he appear with other former band members for reunions or side projects. With the death of Betts on April 18, 2024, Jai Johanny "[[Jaimoe]]" Johanson is the last living founding member of the Allman Brothers Band.

He was inducted with the band into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-allman-brothers-band/ |title=The Allman Brothers Band: inducted in 1995 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=February 28, 2012 |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701000000/http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-allman-brothers-band/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and also won a best rock performance [[Grammy Award]] with the band for "Jessica" in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1995&genre=All|title=1995 Grammy Award Winners|publisher=Grammy.com|access-date=November 18, 2012|archive-date=September 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923073524/http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1995&genre=All|url-status=live}}</ref> Betts was ranked No. 58 on ''Rolling Stone''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list in 2003, and No. 61 on the list published in 2011.<ref name=RS931>{{cite magazine |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=931 |date=September 22, 2003 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/dickey-betts-19691231 |access-date=August 26, 2017 |archive-date=July 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713073551/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/dickey-betts-19691231 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=RS1145>{{cite magazine|title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time|magazine=Rolling Stone|issue=1145|date=November 23, 2011|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/dickey-betts-19691231|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-date=July 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718093137/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/dickey-betts-19691231|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Early life ==
{{expand section|date=September 2024}}

Betts was born in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], on December 12, 1943, and raised in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcwXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT69|title=Skydog: The Duane Allman Story|first=Randy|last=Poe|date=August 1, 2008|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781617134876}}</ref><ref name=NFMHOF>{{cite web|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Michael|title=Betts, Dickey|url=http://nfmhof.com/2008/08/13/betts-dickey|publisher=North Florida Music Hall of Fame|access-date=August 3, 2014|date=August 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108154840/http://nfmhof.com/2008/08/13/betts-dickey|archive-date=November 8, 2014}}</ref> He grew up in a musical family listening to [[traditional bluegrass]], [[country music]] and [[Western swing]]. He started playing ukulele at the age of five and, as his hands got bigger, moved on to mandolin, banjo, and guitar.

==Career==
By the age of sixteen Betts was feeling the need for something "a little faster", and played in a series of rock bands on the Florida circuit, up the East Coast and into the Midwest.  In 1967 he formed the Second Coming in Florida with [[Berry Oakley]]. According to its composer, [[Rick Derringer]], the group called the Jokers referenced in "[[Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo]]" was one of Betts' early groups of that name.<ref>Scott Freeman, ''Midnight Riders'', pp. 41–42</ref>

=== Early Allman Brothers Band years ===
In 1969, [[Duane Allman]], a veteran of the South's "Chitlin' Circuit" of roadhouses and small local venues who'd gone on to form several bands with recording contracts, was casting for talent to build another around.  A successful session player, he'd gained a deal with [[Southern soul]] impresario [[Phil Walden]], who planned to back a [[power trio]] featuring Allman. The ensuing Allman Brothers Band eventually grew to six members, including Duane's brother, organist, vocalist, and composer [[Gregg Allman|Gregg]], Betts, and bassist [[Berry Oakley]].{{cn|date=April 2024}} Duane, who later worked with famed British guitar virtuoso [[Eric Clapton]], earning notoriety for his standout playing on "[[Layla (song)|Layla]]'', the collaboration's signature hit, once said with typical modesty, "I'm the famous guitar player, but Dickey is the good one."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Alex |title=Dickey Betts, Fiery Guitarist With Allman Brothers Band, Dies at 80 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/arts/music/dickey-betts-dead.html |work=The New York Times |date=April 18, 2024 |access-date=April 20, 2024 |archive-date=April 19, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240419202131/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/arts/music/dickey-betts-dead.html |url-status=live }}</ref> 

After Allman's death in October 1971, Betts became the band's sole lead guitarist (with a pianist bringing the group back up to six members) and took on a greater singing, composing, and leadership role. Rushed into the role, he practiced [[slide guitar]] intensively in order to be able to cover the majority of Duane's parts. He wrote "[[Jessica (Allman Brothers Band song)|Jessica]]", inspired by his young daughter Jessica,<ref>{{Cite book|title=One Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band|first=Alan|last=Paul|year=2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1250040497}}</ref>and the Allmans' biggest commercial hit, "[[Ramblin' Man (Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]",<ref>{{cite web|url= https://rockcellarmagazine.com/dickey-betts-dies-allman-brothers-band-obituary/|title=Dickey Betts, Allman Brothers Co-Founder Who Wrote "Ramblin' Man," "Jessica" and More, Dies at 80|publisher=Rockcellarmagazine.com|date=April 18, 2024|accessdate=April 20, 2024}}</ref> for the Band's breakout commercial success, ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', in 1974.

=== Solo career and later work ===
[[File:Dickey Betts (1974).jpg|thumb|Betts in 1974|244x244px]]
Betts's first solo album, ''[[Highway Call]]'', was released in 1974 and featured fiddle player [[Vassar Clements]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Highway Call – Dickey Betts, Richard Betts &#124; Album &#124; AllMus |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/highway-call-mw0000199122 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221022115912/https://www.allmusic.com/album/highway-call-mw0000199122 |archive-date=October 22, 2022 |access-date=April 19, 2024 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> After the Allman Brothers fell apart in 1976, Betts released more albums, starting with ''[[Dickey Betts & Great Southern (album)|Dickey Betts & Great Southern]]'' in 1977, which included the song "Bougainvillea", co-written with future Hollywood star and then Florida transplant [[Don Johnson]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dickey Betts & Great Southern – Dickey Betts & Great Southe |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dickey-betts-great-southern-mw0000602906 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230909051526/https://www.allmusic.com/album/dickey-betts-great-southern-mw0000602906 |archive-date=September 9, 2023 |access-date=April 19, 2024 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> In 1978 he released an album, ''[[Atlanta's Burning Down]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Atlanta's Burning Down – Dickey Betts &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/atlantas-burning-down-mw0000049199 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221020100419/https://www.allmusic.com/album/atlantas-burning-down-mw0000049199 |archive-date=October 20, 2022 |access-date=April 19, 2024 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979 for the album ''[[Enlightened Rogues]]'', with two members of Great Southern replacing Allman Brothers members who were unwilling to participate in the reunion: guitar player [[Dan Toler]] for pianist [[Chuck Leavell]], and bassist [[David Goldflies]] for bassist [[Lamar Williams]]. Several albums and personnel changes followed, until declining record and concert ticket sales, personnel issues, and management problems led the group to disband again in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 27, 2014 |title=History of the Allman Brothers Band |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allman-brothers-band-history/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231003172943/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allman-brothers-band-history/ |archive-date=October 3, 2023 |access-date=April 20, 2024 |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com}}</ref>

Betts formed his own band, [[Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks]], where he was co-frontman along with former [[Wet Willie]] singer, saxophone, and harmonica player [[Jimmy Hall]]. Despite earning good notices, the group was unable to secure a recording contract and disbanded in 1984.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Leavell |first1=Chuck |title=Between Rock And A Home Place |last2=Craig |first2=J.

When a one-off reunion tour was proposed in support of the Allman Brothers' ''[[Dreams (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Dreams]]'' box set, released in 1989 to commemorate the band's 20th anniversary, Betts's solo band again supplied the Allman Brothers' other lead guitarist, [[Warren Haynes]]. The success of the one-off tour resulted in a permanent reunion, which absorbed Betts's energies for the remainder of the 1990s. This band line-up released three studio albums between 1990 and 1994 and won the praise of the critics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Elliott, Mike |date=July 20, 2020 |title=The Allman Brothers Band's 'Seven Turns' Turns 30 {{!}} Anniversary Retrospective |url=https://albumism.com/features/the-allman-brothers-band-seven-turns-turns-30-anniversary-retrospective |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703150058/https://albumism.com/features/the-allman-brothers-band-seven-turns-turns-30-anniversary-retrospective |archive-date=July 3, 2022 |access-date=April 20, 2024 |publisher=Albumism}}</ref>

Betts was replaced on numerous Allman Brothers tour dates throughout the mid-to-late 1990s, for what were reported in the media as "personal reasons". While remaining active as a touring band, the Allman Brothers did not release another album of studio material after 1994's ''[[Where It All Begins]]'' for nine years, until ''[[Hittin' the Note]]'' in 2003. In 1994, Haynes and Allmans bassist Allen Woody formed [[Gov't Mule]] with former Dickey Betts Band drummer Matt Abts as a side project, and left the Allman Brothers for Gov't Mule full-time in 1997. Betts' last show with the Allman Brothers was at the Music Midtown Festival in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], on May 7, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roger Catlin |date=May 25, 2000 |title=BETTS IS ANGRY AS ALLMANS DUMP HIM FROM TOUR |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2000-05-25-0005251999-story.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720154255/https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2000-05-25-0005251999-story.html |archive-date=July 20, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2021 |website=Courant.com}}</ref>

A breaking point was reached after that show and before the launch of the band's Summer Campaign Tour when the remaining original Allman Brothers members – Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks, and Jaimoe – suspended Betts.<ref name="ew">{{Cite magazine |last=Reese |first=Lori |date=May 18, 2000 |title=Brothers in Law |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85221,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021145418/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85221,00.html |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |access-date=June 16, 2011 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> According to Betts, the band told him (reportedly via [[fax]]) to "get clean" (from alcohol and/or drugs). 

He was temporarily replaced for the 2000 tour by [[Jimmy Herring]], formerly of the [[Aquarium Rescue Unit]]. When Betts filed suit against the other three original Allmans, the separation turned into a permanent divorce.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allman |first=Gregg |title=My Cross To Bear |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2012}}{{p.|340}}</ref> Betts re-formed the Dickey Betts Band and toured that same summer.

==Early life==
Church was born on May 3, 1977, in [[Granite Falls, North Carolina]] (Dudley Shoals area), to Ken and Rita Church. Church worked with his father at Clayton Marcus, a furniture upholstery company where his father was president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/519425-pulaski-plans-eric-church-furniture-line|title=Pulaski plans Eric Church furniture line - Furniture Today|website=Furnituretoday.com|date=8 May 2015|access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> At 13, he bought a guitar and began writing songs of his own. By his senior year of high school, he had found a gig at a local bar, which occupied most of his time. He played many [[Jimmy Buffett]] cover songs and a few of his own original songs in some dive bars. Some of these places were so rough that he got into a few altercations from the stage. For a few years, the band played often in bars and restaurants throughout North Carolina.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The band "Mountain Boys" consisted of his college roommate, brother, and a fellow guitarist.<ref name="allmusic" />

Before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Eric graduated from [[South Caldwell High School]] and then [[Appalachian State University]] with a degree in [[marketing]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301808/eric-church/biography |title=Eric Church biography

The future bride's father attempted to persuade Church into a corporate career, which he rejected as an aspiring musician (and later referenced in his song "What I Almost Was" from his debut album). She broke the engagement and he headed to Nashville with his father's financial backing. His father also provided the opportunity to make contacts, and more importantly, time to focus on developing his songwriting ability.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Music career==
===2006–2010: ''Sinners Like Me'' and ''Carolina''===
Church co-wrote [[Terri Clark]]'s 2005 single "The World Needs a Drink",<ref name="allmusic" /> and the track "Whiskey Wings" on [[Dean Miller]]'s 2005 album ''[[Platinum (Dean Miller album)|Platinum]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/platinum-mw0000208385|title=''Platinum'' review|last=Deming|first=Mark|work=Allmusic|access-date=29 August 2012}}</ref> He started recording with different producers. Capitol Nashville showed an interest and watched him perform but they were yet to be convinced enough to offer a recording contract.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AutumnH.html |title=Interview with Autumn House-Tallant |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] | date=3 Oct 2011 |access-date=6 October 2011}}</ref> Autumn House-Tallant told [[HitQuarters]] that they did not think his music was "interesting" enough.<ref name="hitquarters" /> The record company's attitude changed after he started working with producer [[Jay Joyce]]. Doyle states, "Eric scored a meeting with Nashville heavyweight Arthur Buenahora, a publisher at Sony Music who also signed [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Miranda Lambert]].

In November 2022, North Carolina Governor [[Roy Cooper]] awarded Church the North Carolina Award, the state's highest civilian honor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=North Carolina Awards {{!}} NC DNCR |url=https://www.ncdcr.gov/about/special-programs/north-carolina-awards |access-date=2022-11-22 |website=Ncdcr.gov |language=en}}</ref>

Church wears his signature aviator sunglasses as a result of wearing contact lenses. When his career was getting started, he was forced to deal with the heat from the stage lights drying out his contacts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwo51o6xsTA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/fwo51o6xsTA| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|title=Eric Church talks sunglasses inside & Blake Shelton beef| website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> As he began performing in larger venues, his aviators and [[Von Dutch]] denim trucker hat became his trademark.

Church has become an avid advocate for the use of [[cannabis]], reflected in songs such as "[[Smoke a Little Smoke]]"; at the time of that song's release, Church's record label urged him not to release the song, though it had minor success as a single.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Church / |url=http://ericchurch.com/forum/eric-church-blazes-his-own-path |title=Eric Church blazes his own path |access-date=2014-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105031439/http://ericchurch.com/forum/eric-church-blazes-his-own-path |archive-date=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> Church has also referenced marijuana use in other songs like "The Joint" and "I'm Gettin' Stoned", and has even been the subject of a marijuana joke at the 49th ACM Awards where [[Blake Shelton]] and [[Luke Bryan]] referred to Eric Church as the [[Willie Nelson]] for the new-country generation and compared Eric Church's dressing room to a cannabis dispensary.

Church opened Chief's, a bar, restaurant, and performance venue in downtown Nashville in April 2024.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamwindsor/2024/04/05/eric-church-on-chiefs-and-the-special-partnership-behind-his-new-nashville-bar--music-venue/|title=Eric Church & Developer Ben Weprin On The Partnership Behind ‘Chief’s’ - Nashville’s Newest Downtown Bar|first=Pam|last=Windsor|website=Forbes.com}}</ref>

==Musical styles==
Church's style has been described as [[country rock]], [[outlaw country]], and [[southern rock]]. Church's influences include [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Little Feat]], [[The Band]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Ray Wylie Hubbard]] and [[Waylon Jennings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/|title=MSN &#124; Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos|website=Msn.com}}</ref> Church has also said that many [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands influenced his music, including [[Metallica]] and [[AC/DC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhNQj96pLMo | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/dhNQj96pLMo| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|title=Eric Church – Musical Influences |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-01-30 |access-date=2014-02-11}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

'''Gary Ronnie Stewart''' (May 28, 1944 – December 16, 2003)<ref>Some sources state he was born in 1945, but Kentucky birth records and the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] death index proves he was born in 1944. The latter confirms his death date. See Gary R Stewart birth record, Commonwealth of Kentucky, vol. 061, certificate number 30044, 1944.</ref> was an American musician and songwriter, known for his distinctive [[vibrato]] voice and his [[outlaw country]] sound influenced by [[southern rock]]. At the height of his popularity in the mid-1970s, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described him as the "king of [[Honky tonk|honkytonk]]."<ref>{{cite magazine | last = DeVoss | first = David | title = A Honky-Tonk Man | magazine = Time | location=New York | date =  September 27, 1976 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918379,00.html?internalid=ACA | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103145756/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918379,00.html?internalid=ACA | url-status = dead | archive-date = November 3, 2007 | access-date = 2008-02-10}}  He was often introduced as the "King of Honky-Tonk"; see, for instance, the intro to his 2003 live album ''Live at Billy Bob's''.</ref> He had a series of country chart hits from the mid- to late 1970s, the biggest of which was "[[She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)]]", which topped the U.S. country singles chart in 1975.

On December 16, 2003, Stewart died of a [[suicide by gun|self-inflicted gunshot wound]], one month after the death of his wife.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="Flippo">{{cite news  | last = Flippo | first = Chet | title = Honky-Tonk Singer Gary Stewart Dies: Out of Hand country rocker apparently committed suicide | work = CMT.com | date = December 17, 2003 | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1482923/20031217/stewart_gary_1_.jhtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630105933/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1482923/20031217/stewart_gary_1_.jhtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = June 30, 2007 | access-date = 2008-02-10}}</ref><ref name="Passy">{{cite news  | last = Passy | first = Charles  | title = The Ballad of Gary & Mary Lou: Gary Stewart was a Hard-Partying Country Star, the King of Honky-Tonk, but it was his Devoted Lou Who Kept His Life Together, and When She Died, He Just Couldn't Go On | work = Palm Beach Post | date = March 14, 2004 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-92192627.html | access-date = 2008-02-10}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

== Career ==

Learning guitar and piano, Stewart began touring with local bands and writing songs in his teens.  He married Mary Lou Taylor, who was more than three years his senior, at age seventeen and began working days in an airplane factory.  He still played in rock and country bands at night.  While playing in an [[Okeechobee, Florida]], honky-tonk known as the Wagon Wheel, Stewart met country singer [[Mel Tillis]], who advised Stewart to travel to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pitch his songs.  He recorded a few songs for the small Cory label in 1964 and began co-writing songs with local policeman Bill Eldridge.  Stewart and Eldridge wrote [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson's]] 1965 country hit, "Poor Red Georgia Dirt". Signed to the [[Kapp Records|Kapp]] label in 1968, Stewart made several unsuccessful recordings but several songwriting successes followed, for artists like [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] ("She Goes Walking Through My Mind", "Traces of a Woman", "It's Time to Love Her"), [[Cal Smith]] ("You Can't Housebreak a Tomcat", "It Takes Me All Night Long"), and [[Nat Stuckey]] ("Sweet Thang And Cisco"). He even played piano for a time in [[Charley Pride]]'s band the Pridesmen, and can be heard on Pride's live ''In Person'' double-album. Disappointed with [[Music Row]], however, he soon returned to Florida and resumed playing countrified rock 'n' roll in local clubs and bars.<ref>''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; "A Honky-Tonk Man"; "Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; {{cite book | last = Stambler | first = Irwin | author2 = Grelun Landon | title = Country Music: The Encyclopedia | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1997 | location = New York | pages = [https://archive.org/details/countrymusicency00stam/page/464 464–465] | url = https://archive.org/details/countrymusicency00stam/page/464 | isbn = 0-312-15121-7 | url-access = registration }}, {{cite book | last = Bogdanov | first = Vladimir |author2=Chris Woodstra |author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine  | title = All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music | publisher = Backbeat Books | year = 2003 | location = San Francisco | pages = 721–722 | isbn = 0-87930-760-9}}</ref>  In 1970 [[Motown Records]], hoping to get Nashville artists to record their songs, paid Stewart $30 to record countrified demos of "[[Baby I Need Your Loving]]", "[[Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday]]", and "[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]".<ref name="Betts">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-tragic-country-singer-gary-stewarts-rare-motown-demo-for-record-store-day-629194/ |title=Hear Tragic Country Singer Gary Stewart's Rare Motown Demo for Record Store Day |last=Betts |first=Stephen L. |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2018-04-20 |access-date=2020-07-31 }}</ref>

== Peak of career ==
{{quote box|quoted=1|quote=In case it's not clear why [[rock and roll]]ers are so excited about a new [[country music|country]] singer, it's because he really sings [[rockabilly]], which supposedly flourished for a few years in the mid-'50s and then vanished. What I like best about this compilation of flop singles from a few years ago is the way Stewart transforms rockabilly's adolescent phobias about wimmin into unabashed [[burlesque]]s involving the likes of 'Big Bertha' and 'The Snuff Queen.'|source=—Review of ''You're Not the Woman You Used to Be'' in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: S|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=S&bk=70|access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref>|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

Stewart was dropped from Kapp and then from [[Decca Records|Decca]], but a series of demo tapes, including the countrified Motown tunes, found their way into the hands of producer [[Roy Dea]], who convinced Jerry Bradley to sign Stewart to [[RCA Records]].  He returned to Nashville in 1973 and recorded a cover version of "[[Ramblin' Man (Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]" by the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers]], both of whom were Stewart's personal friends. It charted at only #63 on the country chart, but his follow-up, 1974's "Drinkin' Thing" became a top ten hit. His album ''[[Out of Hand]]'' was released in early 1975. "Out of Hand", the title cut, became a #4 country hit and was followed by the #1 hit "She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)".<ref name="ReferenceA">''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; "A Honky-Tonk Man"; "Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', pp. 464–465; ''All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music'', pp. 721–722.</ref><ref name="Betts"/>

The album ''Out of Hand'', which climbed to #6 on the Billboard country album chart, has since become one of the most critically lauded country albums of the 1970s. ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A− saying that it "was the best regular issue country LP I've heard in about five years."<ref>{{cite book | last = Christgau | first = Robert | title = Rock Albums of the '70s: A Critical Guide | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1990 | location = New York | pages = 373 | isbn = 0-306-80409-3}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave it high praise as well, stating that, "With practitioners like Stewart around, honky-tonk—and rockabilly—may not be dead yet."<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Miller | first = Jim | title = Gary Stewart: Out of Hand | magazine = Rolling Stone | issue = 190 | date = July 3, 1975 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/garystewart/albums/album/281494/review/5943163/out_of_hand | access-date = 2008-02-10}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] later gave the album five of five stars and stated that a "strong case could be made for ''Out of Hand'' as one of the Top 100 country records of all time. It might be in this writer's Top Ten!"<ref>''All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music'', pp. 721–722.</ref> Country music critic [[Bill C.

Later in 1975, [[MCA Records|MCA]] released Stewart's old Kapp material scoring a #15 hit with the single "You're Not the Woman You Use to Be".  For the rest of the 1970s Stewart played the honky tonks with his road band, The Honky Tonk Liberation Army, and recorded similar albums with modest success for RCA: 1976's ''Steppin' Out''; 1977's ''Your Place or Mine'' (which featured guest artists [[Nicolette Larson]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Rodney Crowell]]); and 1978's ''[[Little Junior (album)|Little Junior]]''. These albums spawned several hit singles, including: "Flat Natural Born Good-Timin' Man", "In Some Room Above the Street", "Single Again", "Your Place or Mine", "Quits", and "Whiskey Trip".<ref>''Country Music: The Rough Guide'', pp. 376–377; "A Honky-Tonk Man"; "Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart"; ''Gary Stewart: Biography''; ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', pp. 464–465; ''All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music'', pp. 721–722; ''Rock Albums of the '70s: A Critical Guide'', p. 373.</ref> His 1977 ode to marital distress entitled "Ten Years of This", from the album ''Your Place or Mine'', was a favorite of [[Bob Dylan]] and a #16 hit.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=McDonough|first1=Jimmy|title=LITTLE JUNIOR, KING OF THE HONKY-TONKS The life and death of Gary Stewart|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/garystewart.html|website=Perfect Sound Forever|access-date=8 September 2015}}</ref> Dylan noted his admiration of Stewart in a 1978 interview with ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.interferenza.net/bcs/interw/play78.htm|title=PLAYBOY INTERVIEW: BOB DYLAN|website=Interferenza.net|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Later career==
Though his late 1970s albums were well received by critics and his core fans, Stewart never established a large rapport with the general music audience. He was often labeled as "too country" for rock listeners and "too rock" for country fans. In 1980, he released the [[Chips Moman]]-produced ''[[Cactus and a Rose]]'' which featured Southern rockers [[Gregg Allman]], [[Dickey Betts]], [[Mike Lawler]], and [[Bonnie Bramlett]]. It did not garner much airplay and RCA teamed Stewart up with songwriter [[Dean Dillon]] for a pair of duet records. Soon after, Stewart returned to Florida, where alcoholism and drug use kept him from recording for much of the 1980s. His son, Gary Joseph Stewart, committed suicide late in the decade as well. Stewart signed with the [[HighTone Records|HighTone]] label in 1988 and recorded three albums over the next five years. These albums included fan favorites like the minor hit "An Empty Glass (That's the Way the Day Ends)" (written by Stewart and Dillon), "Let's Go Jukin'" (written by Stewart and Betts), and "Brand New Whiskey" (written by Stewart and his wife).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Stewart continued to tour through the 1990s, playing venues such as [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth's]] [[Billy Bob's Texas]] several times a year.<ref>{{cite web | title = Gary Stewart | work = Lone Star Music | url = http://www.lonestarmusic.com/index.php?file=a-artist&iArtistId=975 | access-date = 2008-02-13}}</ref> During this time, Bob Dylan, while touring with [[Tom Petty]] in Florida, drove out of his way to meet Stewart, "confessing that he'd played Stewart's ode to marital malaise 'Ten Years of This' over and over, the record casting a spell over him."<ref name="auto"/> In 2003, Stewart released ''Live at Billy Bob's Texas'', his first album in ten years and his first-ever live album. Reviewers at Allmusic gave it good marks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-billy-bobs-texas-mw0000019113|title=Live at Billy Bob's Texas - Gary Stewart - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Stewart was born in [[Jenkins, Kentucky]], on May 28, 1944, the son of George and Georgia Stewart. He was named after the actor [[Gary Cooper]].  In 1959 his father, a [[coal mining|coal miner]], sustained an injury while working in the mines, and shortly afterwards the family moved to [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]], a city on [[Florida]]'s [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast.<ref>"A Honky-Tonk Man"; {{cite book | last = Wolff | first = Kurt |author2=Orla Duane  | title = Country Music: The Rough Guide | publisher = Rough Guides | year = 2000 | location = London | pages = 376–377 | isbn = 1-85828-534-8}}, {{cite web | last = McDonough | first = Jimmy | title = Little Junior, King of the Honky-Tonks: The Life and Death of Gary Stewart | work = Perfect Sound Forever | year = 2004 | url = http://www.furious.com/perfect/garystewart.html | format = Electronic Journal | access-date = 2008-02-10}}, and {{cite web | title = Gary Stewart: Biography | work = CMT.com | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/stewart_gary_1_/bio.jhtml | access-date = 2008-02-10}}</ref>

On November 26, 2003, the day before [[Thanksgiving]], his wife of nearly 43 years, Mary Lou, died of [[pneumonia]]. Stewart, who had been scheduled to play Billy Bob's three days later, canceled his concert appearances. His friends later told reporters that he was extremely despondent after Mary Lou's death. 

On December 16, his daughter's boyfriend and Stewart's very close friend, Bill Hardman, visited his Fort Pierce, Florida, home to check on his welfare. They found Stewart dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="Flippo"/><ref name="Passy"/>

==Posthumous releases==
In 2005, the Australia-based [[Raven Records]] released a CD containing Stewart's second and fourth albums: ''Steppin' Out'' and ''Little Junior'', augmented with three previously unreleased bonus tracks from the RCA vaults. It was followed by a second Raven release containing ''Brotherly Love'' and ''Those Were the Days'', expanded and augmented by rare bonus tracks which were previously unavailable on CD.<ref name=Discogs_GaryStewart>{{cite web| title=Gary Stewart| publisher=[[Discogs]]| url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/264158-Gary-Stewart| access-date=2020-07-01}}</ref> Two songs from the era featured on this collection later became hits when recorded by [[George Strait]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Wounded Bird Records]] released a CD in 2010 which included the albums ''Cactus and a Rose'' and ''Collector's Series'', a comprehensive greatest hits collection.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  In 2010, UK-based Floating World Records reissued Stewart's albums from the late 1980s and early 1990s: ''Brand New'', ''Battleground'' and ''I'm a Texan''. Floating World purchased the entire back catalog from the now-defunct [[HighTone Records|HighTone]] label.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  In 2013, UK-based Morello Records released a CD containing Stewart's first and third albums: ''Out of Hand'' and ''Your Place or Mine''.  In 2017, Morello released a CD containing Stewart's fifth and sixth albums: ''Gary'' and ''Cactus and a Rose''.<ref name=Discogs_GaryStewart/>

For [[Record Store Day]] in 2018, the Delmore Recording Society label released a 45 rpm single called ''Mowtown'' containing Stewart's versions of the [[Motown]] classics "[[Baby I Need Your Loving]]" and "[[Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday]]".  Stewart recorded the tracks (and the unreleased "[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]") in 1970 when Motown Records wanted demos of their songs in a Nashville style, hoping to interest [[country music]] artists in recording Motown songs.  Stewart was paid $30 for the session.<ref name="Betts"/>

In May 2020, the [[Austin, TX|Austin]]-based band [[Mike and the Moonpies]] released ''Touch of You: The Lost Songs of Gary Stewart'', an album of unreleased songs written or co-written by Stewart.  The band's version of Stewart's "Smooth Shot of Whiskey", featuring [[Mark Wystrach]] of the band [[Midland (band)|Midland]] was released as a single.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Freeman |first=Jon |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/mike-and-the-moonpies-gary-stewart-album-1005204/ |title=Mike and the Moonpies Cover Gary Stewart on New Album, 'Touch of You' |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2020-05-26 |access-date=2020-06-30 }}</ref>

'''Gregory LeNoir Allman''' (December 8, 1947&nbsp;– May 27, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]", "[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]", and "[[Midnight Rider]]". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and then [[Macon, Georgia]].

He and his brother [[Duane Allman]] formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released  ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star [[Cher]]. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song "[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012). His final album, ''[[Southern Blood (album)|Southern Blood]]'', was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.

Allman performed with a [[Hammond organ]] and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a [[Southern rock]] pioneer<ref>Sources:

== Early life ==
[[File:Lebanon tennessee city hall.jpg|thumb|Allman and his brother [[Duane Allman|Duane]] attended [[Castle Heights Military Academy]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] in their childhood.]]
Gregory LeNoir Allman was born on December 8, 1947, at [[Saint Thomas - West Hospital|Saint Thomas Hospital]] in Nashville, [[Tennessee]] to Geraldine Robbins Allman (1917–2015) and Willis Turner Allman (1918–1949).{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=9–12}} The couple had met during [[World War II]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], North Carolina when Allman was on leave from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], and were later married. Their first child, Duane Allman, was born in Nashville in November 20,1946. On December 26, 1949, Willis offered a ride home to a hitchhiker, who shot and killed him in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia.<ref name="HR15">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gregg-allman-my-cross-bear-cher-319596|title=BOOK REVIEW: 'My Cross to Bear' by Gregg Allman With Alan Light|date=May 16, 2012|first=Andy|last=Lewis|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The night Gregg Allman's dad died in Norfolk |url=http://pilotonline.com/news/local/history/the-night-gregg-allman-s-dad-died-in-norfolk/article_f5958a5d-e40f-53b6-b9f4-acbc1c7d8f93.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808195439/https://www.pilotonline.com/news/local/history/the-night-gregg-allman-s-dad-died-in-norfolk/article_f5958a5d-e40f-53b6-b9f4-acbc1c7d8f93.html|archive-date=August 8, 2017|last=Ollison |first=Rashod |publisher=The Virginian Pilot|date=June 1, 2017}}</ref> Geraldine moved to Nashville with her two sons and never remarried.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=4}} Lacking money to support her children, she enrolled in college to become a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA)—state laws at the time, according to her son, required students to live on-campus.<ref name="RS73">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-allman-brothers-story-19731206|title=The Allman Brothers Story|date=December 6, 1973|first=Cameron|last=Crowe|author-link=Cameron Crowe|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref>

As a result, Gregg and his older brother were sent to [[Castle Heights Military Academy]] in nearby [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=9–12}} A young Gregg interpreted these actions as evidence of his mother's dislike for him, though he later came to understand the reality: "She was actually sacrificing everything she possibly could—she was working around the clock, getting by just by a hair, so as to not send us to an [[orphanage]], which would have been a living hell."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=14}} While his brother adapted to his surroundings with a defiant attitude, Allman felt largely depressed at the school. With little to do, he studied often and developed an interest in medicine—had he not gone into music, he hoped to become a dentist.<ref name="SL07" /> He was rarely hazed at Castle Heights as his brother protected him, but often suffered beatings from instructors when he received poor grades.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=16}} The brothers returned to Nashville upon their mother's graduation, and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in 1959.<ref name="RS73" /> Allman would later recall two separate events in his life that led to his interest in music. In 1960, the two brothers attended a concert in Nashville with [[Jackie Wilson]] headlining alongside [[Otis Redding]], [[B.B. King]], and [[Patti LaBelle]].<ref name="SL07">{{cite news|url=http://www.southernliving.com/travel/south-east/home-gregg-allman|title=At Home With Gregg Allman|date=August 2007|first=Allison|last=Hersh|work=[[Southern Living]]|access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref> Allman was also exposed to music through Jimmy Banes, an [[intellectually disabled]] neighbor of his grandmother in Nashville, who introduced him to the guitar.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=8}}

Gregg worked as a [[paper boy]] to afford a [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] guitar, which he purchased at a [[Sears]] when he saved up enough funds.<ref name="RS73" /> Like his brother, he was left-handed, but played the guitar right-handed. He and his brother often fought to play the instrument, though there was "no question that music brought" the two together.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=31}} In Daytona, they joined a [[YMCA]] group called the Y Teens, their first experience performing music with others.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} He and Duane returned to Castle Heights in their teen years, where they formed a band, the Misfits.<ref name="PLEASE">{{cite book|title=Please Be with Me: A Song for My Father, Duane Allman|last=Allman |first=Gladrielle |location=New York City |publisher=[[Spiegel & Grau]] |page=70 |isbn=978-1-4000-6894-4|year=2014}}</ref> Despite this, he still felt "lonesome and out of place", and quit the academy.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=41}} He returned to Daytona Beach and pursued music further, and the duo formed another band, the Shufflers, in 1963.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} He attended high school at [[Seabreeze High School]], where he graduated in 1965.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=28}} However, he grew undisciplined in his studies as his interests diverged: "Between the women and the music, school wasn't a priority anymore."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=42}}

We rehearsed constantly.

The two Allman brothers began meeting various musicians in the Daytona Beach area. They met a man named [[Floyd Miles]], and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. "I would just sit there and study Floyd ... I studied how he phrased his songs, how he got the words out, and how the other guys sang along with him", Gregg would later recall.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=46}} They later formed their first "real" band, the Escorts, which performed a mix of [[top 40]] and R&B music at clubs around town.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=49}} Duane, who took the lead vocal role on early demos, encouraged his younger brother to sing instead.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=21}} He and Duane often spent all of their money on records, as they attempted to learn songs from them. The group performed constantly as music became their entire focus; Gregg missed his high school graduation because he was performing that evening.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=50}} In his autobiography, Gregg recalls listening to Nashville R&B station [[WLAC]] at night and discovering artists such as [[Muddy Waters]], who later became central to his musical evolution.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=63}} He avoided being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]] by intentionally shooting himself in the foot.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=61}}

The Escorts evolved into [[the Allman Joys]], the brothers' first successful band. After a successful summer run locally, they hit the road in fall 1965 for a series of performances throughout the Southeast; their first show outside Daytona was at the Stork Club in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama, where they were booked for 22 weeks straight.<ref name="AL12">{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2012/12/mobile_holds_memories_for_greg.html|title=Mobile holds memories for Gregg Allman, who plays Saenger Dec. 30|date=December 18, 2012|first=Lawrence|last=Specker|work=[[Press-Register]]|publisher=[[AL.com]]|access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref> Afterwards, they were booked at the Sahara Club in nearby [[Pensacola]], Florida, for several weeks.<ref name="PS09">{{cite news|url=http://www.pnj.com/article/20091101/LIFE/911010302|title='Florida Rocks Again!'|date=November 1, 2009|first= Troy|last= Moon |work=[[Pensacola News Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205222427/http://www.pnj.com/article/20091101/LIFE/911010302|archive-date=December 5, 2009}}</ref> Allman later regarded Pensacola as "a real turning point in my life", as it was where he learned how to capture audiences and about stage presence.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=66}} He also received his first [[Vox Continental|Vox keyboard]] there, and learned how to play it over the ensuing tour.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=70}} By the following summer, they were able to book time at a studio in Nashville, where they recorded several songs, aided by a plethora of drugs. These recordings were later released as ''Early Allman'' in 1973, to Allman's dismay.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=72}} He soon grew tired of performing covers and began writing original compositions.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=73}} They settled in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] for a time, where in the spring of 1967 they began performing alongside Johnny Sandlin and [[Paul Hornsby]], among others, under various names. They considered disbanding, but Bill McEuen, manager of the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], convinced the band to relocate to Los Angeles, giving them the funds to do so.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=77}}

He arranged a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] in June 1967,{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=41}} and they began to record an album under the new name the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], suggested by their producer, Dallas Smith. Recording was a difficult experience; "the music had no life to it—it was poppy, preprogrammed shit", Allman felt.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} Though they considered themselves [[sellouts]], they needed money to live.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} At concerts, they declined to play anything off their [[Hour Glass (Hour Glass album)|debut album]], released that October, instead opting to play the blues.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=91}} Such gigs were sparse, however, as Liberty only allowed one performance per month.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=83}} After some personnel changes, they recorded their second album, ''[[Power of Love (Hour Glass album)|Power of Love]]'', released in March 1968. It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to [[Non-compete clause|freeze the band]], so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album. The rest of the band mocked Allman, viewing him as too scared to leave and return to the South.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Meanwhile, Duane began doing session work at [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], where he began putting together a new band. He phoned his brother with the proposition of joining the new band—which would have two guitarists and two drummers. With his deal at Liberty fulfilled, he drove to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in March 1969 to jam with the new band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=109}} He called the birth of the group "one of the finer days in my life ... I was starting to feel like I belonged to something again."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=110}}

The Allman Brothers Band moved to [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], Georgia,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=32}} and forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming [[psychedelic drugs]], and hanging out in [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]], where they would write songs and more—"I'd be lying if I said I didn't have my way with a lady or two down there", said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}}{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=127}} In addition to Gregg, the band included Duane, [[Dickey Betts]] on guitar, [[Berry Oakley]] on bass, and [[Jaimoe]] and [[Butch Trucks]] on drums.<ref name="AM"/> The group remade blues numbers like "[[Trouble No More]]" and "[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]", in addition to improvising jams.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=41}} Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band's main songwriter, composing songs such as "Whipping Post" and "Midnight Rider".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=42}} The group's [[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in November 1969 through [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]],<ref>{{cite book|last      = Freeman|first     = Scott|title     = Midnight Riders: The Story of the Allman Brothers Band|year      = 1996|publisher = Little, Brown and Company|isbn      = 978-0316294522|page=59}}</ref> but suffered from poor sales.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=64}} The band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road,{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}} which contributed to a larger following.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} Their second record, ''[[Idlewild South]]'',{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} was issued in September 1970, and also received a muted commercial response.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}}

Their fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, where the band's average earnings doubled.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=115}} "We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album", said Gregg.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} ''At Fillmore East'', recorded at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York City, was released in July 1971.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=124}} ''At Fillmore East'' peaked at number thirteen on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top Pop Albums]] chart, and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with addiction to numerous drugs; they all agreed to quit heroin, but [[cocaine]] remained a problem.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=147}} His last conversation with Duane was an argument over cocaine: Gregg took some of his brother's supply, and later denied it when accused. In his memoir, ''My Cross to Bear'', Gregg wrote: "I have thought of that lie every day of my life ... told him that lie, and he told me that he was sorry and that he loved me."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=193}}

Duane was killed in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, in Macon.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} At his funeral, Gregg performed "Melissa", which was his brother's favorite song.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=196}} "I tried to play and I tried to sing, but I didn't do too much writing. In the days and weeks that followed, ... I wondered if I'd ever find the passion, the energy, the love of making music", he remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=197}} As the band took some time apart to process their loss, ''At Fillmore East'' became a major success domestically. "What we had been trying to do for all those years finally happened, and he was gone," Gregg remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=198}} He later expanded upon his brother's passing in his memoir:

{{blockquote|When I got over being angry, I prayed to him to forgive me, and I realized that my brother had a blast. ... Not that I got over it—I still ain't gotten over it. I don't know what getting over it means, really. I don't stand around crying anymore, but I think about him every day of my life. ... Maybe a lot of learning how to grieve was that I had to grow up a little bit and realize that death is part of life. Now I can talk to my brother in the morning, and he answers me at night. I've opened myself to his death and accepted it, and I think that's the grieving process at work.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=200–02}}}}

=== Mainstream success and fame (1972–1976) ===
After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=162}} They completed their third studio album, ''[[Eat a Peach]]'', that winter, which raised each member's spirits: "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing ''Eat a Peach''", said Allman.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=204}} ''Eat a Peach'' was released the following February, and it became the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on ''Billboard''{{'s}} album chart.<ref name="AM" /> "We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever", Allman recalled.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=210}} The band purchased 432 acres of land in [[Juliette, Georgia]], which became a group hangout.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=175}} Berry Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of his friend,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=185}} and in November 1972 he too was killed in a motorcycle crash.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=189}} "Upset as I was, I kind of breathed a sigh of relief, because Berry's pain was finally over", Allman said.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=210}}
{{listen|filename=Gregg Allman - Queen of Hearts.ogg |title="Queen of Hearts"|description="Queen of Hearts" led Allman to record his first solo album, ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' (1973).|format=[[Ogg]]||pos=left}}
The band unanimously decided to carry on, and enlisted [[Lamar Williams]] on bass and [[Chuck Leavell]] on piano. The band began recording ''Brothers and Sisters'', their follow-up album, and Betts became the group's ''de facto'' leader during the recording process.<ref name="AM.1" /> Meanwhile, after some internal disagreements, Allman began recording a solo album, which he titled ''Laid Back''. The sessions for both albums often overlapped and its creation caused tension within the rest of the band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=216}} Both albums were released in late 1973, with ''Brothers and Sisters'' cementing the Allman Brothers' place among the biggest rock bands of the 1970s. "Everything that we'd done before—the touring, the recording—culminated in that one album", Allman recalled.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=241}} "[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]", Betts' country-infused number, rose to number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and gave the band their biggest hit.<ref name="AM">{{cite web |first=Bruce |last=Eder |title=The Allman Brothers Band&nbsp;– All Music Guide |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-allman-brothers-band-mn0000745964/biography |access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref> The group returned to touring, and played arenas and stadiums almost solely. Privately, the group was dealing with miscommunication and spiraling drug problems.<ref name="AM" />{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=211}} In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting [[the Starship]], a customized [[Boeing 720]]B used by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=230}} "When [we] got that goddamn plane, it was the beginning of the end", said Allman.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=261}}

Band member relationships became increasingly frustrated, amplified by heavy drug and alcohol abuse.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=244}} In January 1975, Allman began a relationship with pop star Cher—which made him more "[[famous for being famous]] than for his music", according to biographer Alan Paul.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=234}} The sessions that produced 1975's ''[[Win, Lose or Draw (album)|Win, Lose or Draw]]'', the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=253}} Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were "embarrassed" by the album.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=236}} Though their relationships were fraying, the Allman Brothers Band went on tour for some of the biggest crowds of their career.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=262}} Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] as the only real "high point" in an otherwise "rough, rough tour".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=268}} The "breaking point" came when Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring, who was arrested and soon convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.<ref name="AM" /> Bandmates considered Allman a "snitch", and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} Herring received a 75-year prison sentence, but he only served eighteen months.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} The band refused to communicate with Allman after the ordeal and finally broke up.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in [[Sea Level (band)|Sea Level]], Betts formed [[Great Southern (band)|Great Southern]], and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}}

== Mid-career and struggles ==
=== Marriages, breakups, and music (1975–1981) ===
[[File:Cher and Greg Allman - 1975.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Allman with then-wife [[Cher]] in 1975.]]
Allman married Cher in June 1975, and the two lived in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] during their years together as tabloid favorites.<ref name="HR15" /> Their marriage produced one son, Elijah Blue Allman, who was born in July 1976.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=277}} He recorded his second solo album, ''[[Playin' Up a Storm]]'', with the Gregg Allman Band, and it was released in May 1977. He also worked on a collaborative album with Cher titled ''[[Two the Hard Way]]'', which, upon its release, was a massive failure.<ref name="AM.1">{{cite web |first=Bruce |last=Eder |title=Gregg Allman&nbsp;– All Music Guide |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gregg-allman-mn0000801101/biography |access-date=September 30, 2015}}</ref> The couple went to Europe to tour in support of both albums,<ref name="gruber">{{cite news | title=Gregg and Cher are singing together | author=Gruber, Ruth | publisher=[[United Press International]] | date=November 16, 1977}}</ref> though the crowd reception was mixed.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=280}} With a combination of Allman Brothers fans and Cher fans, fights often broke out in venues, which led Cher to cancel the tour.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=281}} Turmoil began to overwhelm their relationship, and the two divorced in 1978.<ref name="quirk">{{cite book | last=Quirk | first=Lawrence J. | title=Totally Uninhibited: The Life and Wild Times of Cher | publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-688-09822-3 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/totallyuninhibit00quir }} p. 118.</ref> Allman returned to Daytona Beach to stay with his mother, spending the majority of his time partying, chasing women, and touring with [[the Nighthawks]], a blues band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=282–83}}

The Allman Brothers Band reunited in 1978.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=284}} Allman remembered that each member had his own reasons for rejoining, though he surmised it was a combination of displeasure with how things ended, missing each other, and a need for money.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=285}} The band's reunion album, ''[[Enlightened Rogues]]'', was released in February 1979 and was a mild commercial success.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=246}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} and led the band to sign with [[Arista Records|Arista]], who pushed the band to "modernize" their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly for Betts and Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=251}} The band again grew apart, replacing Jaimoe with new guitarist [[Dan Toler]]'s brother Frankie.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} The band considered their post-reunion albums—''[[Reach for the Sky (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' (1980) and ''[[Brothers of the Road (album)|Brothers of the Road]]'' (1981)—"embarrassing", and subsequently broke up in 1982. "It was like a whole different band made those records ... In truth, though, I was just too drunk most of the time to care one way or the other", Allman would recall.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=295–96}}

=== Downtime, a surprise hit, and another reformation (1982–1990) ===
{{quote box
 |quote  = No two ways about it, the '80s were rough. ... It was seven years of going, 'What is it that I do?' Being self-employed your whole life, that becomes a certain rock, a reinforcement. When that's gone, not only are you bored stiff, but you just want to cry—'What do I do? I know I used to serve a purpose.'{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=304}}

}}

Allman spent much of the 1980s adrift and living in [[Sarasota, Florida]] with friends.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=302}} His alcohol abuse was at one of its worst points, with Allman consuming "a minimum of a fifth of [[vodka]] a day."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=296}} He felt the local police pursued him heavily; during this time, he was arrested and charged with a [[DUI]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=304}} While he did not consider himself "washed up", he noted in his autobiography that he kept a "fear of everybody forgetting about you."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=304}} Southern rock had faded from view and [[electronic music]] formed much of the pop music of the decade. "There was hardly anybody playing live music, and those who did were doing it for not much money, in front of some die-hard old [[hippies]] in real small clubs", he later recalled.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=298}} Nevertheless, he reformed the Gregg Allman Band and toured nationwide.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=303}} At one point, he attempted to reconnect with his children, though, according to him, "it just wasn't a good situation".{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=300}}

By 1986, having grown tired of financial instability, Allman approached Betts for a co-headlining tour, a sort-of Allman Brothers reunion.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=305}} After recording several demos, Allman was offered a recording contract by [[Epic Records]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=306}} His third solo release, ''[[I'm No Angel (album)|I'm No Angel]]'' (1987), sold well; its [[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|title track]] became a surprise hit on radio. Allman released another solo album the following year, ''[[Just Before the Bullets Fly]]'', though it did not sell as well as its predecessor. In the late 1980s, he moved to Los Angeles.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=309}} He married Danielle Galiana in what he dubbed [[midlife crisis]].{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=309}}<ref name="Thompson2020">{{cite book |editor1-last=Thompson |editor1-first=Clifford |title=Contemporary World Musicians |date=2020 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-93961-8 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVYAEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT58}}</ref> The marriage began with Allman overdosing—"so [it] started off with a bang", he said.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=310}} He dabbled in acting starting in 1989, taking several small parts. His largest (and final) role was criminal Will Gaines in the 1991 crime drama ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]''. Allman greatly enjoyed the experience: "It was a different facet of the entertainment industry, and I wanted to see how those people worked together."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=323}} The Allman Brothers Band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989, and the band reunited once more for a summer tour, with Jaimoe again on drums.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} They featured guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] and pianist [[Johnny Neel]], both from the Dickey Betts Band, and bassist [[Allen Woody]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} The band returned to the studio with longtime producer Tom Dowd for 1990's ''[[Seven Turns]]'', which was considered a return to form.<ref name="AM" />{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=277}} "[[Good Clean Fun (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Good Clean Fun]]" and "[[Seven Turns (song)|Seven Turns]]" each became big hits on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. The addition of Haynes and Woody had "reenergized" the ensemble.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=280}}

=== Reforming the band and breaking addictions (1991–2000) ===
The newly reformed Allman Brothers began touring heavily,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=294}} which helped build a new fan base: "We had to build a fan base all over again, but as word of mouth spread about how good the music was, more and more people took notice. It felt great, man, and that really helped the music", Allman recalled.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=317}} Neel left the group and the band added percussionist [[Marc Quiñones]], formerly of [[Spyro Gyra]], the following year.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=290}} They recorded two more studio albums—''[[Shades of Two Worlds]]'' (1992) and ''[[Where It All Begins]]''. In 1993 his youngest daughter Layla Brooklyn Allman was born while Gregg was living in [[Novato, California]]. When his relationship with Shelby Blackburn ended, Layla and Shelby moved back to Los Angeles. Allman's older daughter, Island, came to live with him in Novato, and despite early struggles, they eventually grew very close.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=324}} "Island is the love of my life, she really is", he would later write.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=284}} The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could barely make it through his acceptance speech.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=318}} Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. He hired two in-home nurses that switched twelve-hour shifts to help him through the process.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=330}} He was immensely happy to finally quit alcohol, writing later in his autobiography: "Did I get any positive anything out of all that? And you've got to admit to yourself, no, I didn't. You can see what happened and that by the grace of God, you finally quit before it killed you."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=330}}

For much of the 1990s, Allman lived in [[Marin County, California]], spending his free time with close friends and riding his motorcycle.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=325}} He recorded a fifth solo album, ''[[Searching for Simplicity]]'', which was quietly released on [[550 Music]] in 1997.<ref name="AM.1" /> The album's title reflected his search "for a more simple life" following his rehabilitation from drugs and alcohol.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gregg Allman: Searching for Simplicity|author=Ray Hogan|page=D1–D6|work=Daily Advocate|location=Stamford, Connecticut|date=November 23, 1997}}</ref> Despite positive developments in his personal life, relationships began declining in the band yet again.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=312}} Haynes and Woody left to focus on [[Gov't Mule]], feeling as though a break was imminent.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}} The group recruited [[Oteil Burbridge]] of the [[Col. Bruce Hampton and The Aquarium Rescue Unit|Aquarium Rescue Unit]] to replace Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=326}} Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}} "It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing", said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} Pearson, struggling with [[tinnitus]], left as a result.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=331}} Butch Trucks phoned his nephew, [[Derek Trucks]], to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=342}} All involved contended that the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, which led to a permanent divorce.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} That August, Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}} which hit Allman particularly hard.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=341}} In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}} setting the stage for over a decade of stability within the group.

In ''My Cross to Bear'', Allman reflected on his life and career:

{{blockquote|Music is my life's blood. I love music, I love to play good music, and I love to play music for people who appreciate it. And when it's all said and done, I'll go to my grave and my brother will greet me, saying, "Nice work, little brother—you did alright." I must have said this a million times, but if I died today, I have had me a blast.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=378}}}}

==Musical style and songwriting==
{{listen|filename=Gregg Allman - Midnight Rider.ogg|title="Midnight Rider"|description=Allman's solo rendition of "Midnight Rider" (1973). He considered it his [[signature song]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Allman's style was rooted in rhythm and blues music. He characterized his work with the Allman Brothers Band as "playing some blues with some jazz mixed in."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=181}} He was introduced to blues music through musician and childhood friend Floyd Miles,{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=417}} who later toured with Allman as a part of his solo band.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/floyd-miles-mn0000196076|title=Floyd Miles|author=Jason Ankeny |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref> He also gave him advice on how to sing from his stomach, as opposed to his chest. Allman was inspired by [[Little Milton|"Little Milton" Campbell]], who "inspired me all my life to get my voice crisper, get my diaphragm harder, use less air, and just spit it out. He taught me to be absolutely sure of every note you hit, and to hit it solid."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|pp=47–48}} After his death, many outlets credited Allman as among the greatest white blues vocalists of his time.<ref>Sources crediting Allman as a "white blues singer":

As a songwriter, Allman wrote several famous songs, including "Whipping Post", "Melissa", and "Midnight Rider", which he dubbed the "song I'm most proud of in my career." He could be a very slow songwriter, writing only when inspiration struck. If the song was forced, he felt it could end up contrived. In ''My Cross to Bear'', his 2012 memoir, he laid out his approach to songwriting: the first verse introduces a story, it is expounded upon in the second, and the third may serve as an epilogue.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|pp=152–53}} Allman credited singer-songwriter [[John D. Loudermilk]], whom he first met while touring with the Allman Joys, as an influence on his writing. "[He] taught me to let the song come to me, not to force it, not to put down a word just because it might rhyme or fit. He taught me to let the feeling come from your heart and go to your head."{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=68}} Allman received the Songwriter Award from the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in the last year of his life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/22/drivin-n-cryin-gregg-allman-sam-moore-set-to-be-inducted-into-georgia-music-hall-of-fame/|title=Drivin' N' Cryin', Gregg Allman, Sam Moore set to be inducted into Georgia Music Hall of Fame|date=June 3, 2016|author=Melissa Ruggieri|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|access-date=July 5, 2017|archive-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306202343/http://music.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/22/drivin-n-cryin-gregg-allman-sam-moore-set-to-be-inducted-into-georgia-music-hall-of-fame/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In ''My Cross to Bear'', he wrote that "Every woman I've ever had a relationship with has loved me for who they thought I was."{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=229}} At the time of its writing, he noted that he only spoke to two out of his then-six ex-wives, including Cher.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=366–67}}

Allman had five children, three with various wives and two with other women he had relationships with:
* son Michael Allman was born on July 3, 1966. He was raised in Daytona Beach, Florida. From his relationship with go-go dancer Mary Lynn Sutton.
* son [[Devon Allman]] (born 1972), lead singer of [[Honeytribe]] and [[The Allman Betts Band]], from his marriage to Shelley Kay Jefts;
* son [[Elijah Blue Allman]] (born 1976), lead singer of [[Deadsy]], from his marriage to Cher;

* daughter Layla Brooklyn Allman (born 1993), lead singer of [[Picture Me Broken]], from a relationship with radio journalist Shelby Blackburn<ref name="abc7.com" />

Allman was averse to organized religion for many years, but claimed he always believed in a God.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/love-family-drugs-gregg-allman-tells-130822287.html|title=Love, family, drugs: Gregg Allman tells it all|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 7, 2012|access-date=July 13, 2017|first=Chris|last=Talbott|archive-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306143201/https://www.yahoo.com/news/love-family-drugs-gregg-allman-tells-130822287.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following his health ailments in the latter stages of his life, he came around to his own form of Christianity, and began wearing a cross necklace. In his memoir, he stated: "As long as you have spirituality, you're never alone. It's sort of like my mother said all those years ago: now I have my own kind of faith, just like other people. They take what they want of faith, and they leave the rest alone, and I do the same. That's the way it should be." He credited his sixth wife, Stacey Fountain, with helping him increase his faith.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|pp=366–67}}

'''Randall Hank Williams''' (born May 26, 1949), known professionally as '''Hank Williams Jr.''' or '''Bocephus''', is an American singer-songwriter and musician. His musical style has been described as a blend of [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]], and [[country music|country]]. He is the son of country musician [[Hank Williams]] and the father of musicians [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]] and [[Hank Williams III]], and the grandfather of [[Coleman Williams]]. He is also the half brother of [[Jett Williams]].

Williams began his career following in his famed father's footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a December 1963 episode of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ''[[Shindig!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929947/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t130|title=Hank Williams, Jr.|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref>

As Williams struggled to define his own voice and place within the [[country music]] genre, his style began slowly to evolve. His career was interrupted by a near-fatal fall while Williams was climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak in Montana]] on August 8, 1975.<ref name="People">{{cite journal|last=Buchalter|first=Gail|date=October 22, 1979|title=Hank Williams Jr. Fell Down a Mountain and Lived Now He's Climbing High on the C&w Charts|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=12|issue=17|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074883,00.html|access-date=August 3, 2013|archive-date=April 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425141320/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074883,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="TheFall">{{cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/the-fall/|title=The Fall|publisher=[[Country Music Hall of Fame]]|access-date=August 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104074223/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/the-fall/|archive-date=November 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After an extended recovery, he rebuilt his career in the [[country rock]] scene.<ref name=Burns/> As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of musical instrument skills includes guitar, bass guitar, [[upright bass]], [[steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[dobro]], piano, keyboards, saxophone, [[harmonica]], [[fiddle]], and drums.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hankjr.com/about/?id=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716224600/http://www.hankjr.com/about/?id=2|url-status=dead|title=Hank Williams Jr. – Official Website|archive-date=July 16, 2011|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> In 2020, Williams Jr. was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name="Paulson">{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/08/12/hank-williams-jr-marty-stuart-dean-dillon-country-music-hall-fame/3352839001/|title=Hank Williams Jr., Marty Stuart, Dean Dillon to enter the Country Music Hall of Fame|first=Matthew Leimkuehler and Dave|last=Paulson|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
Williams was born Randall Hank Williams on May 26, 1949, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. His [[Hank Williams|father]] nicknamed him Bocephus (after [[Grand Ole Opry]] comedian [[Rod Brasfield]]'s ventriloquist dummy).<ref>{{cite magazine|url =https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-awkward-enduring-influence-of-hank-williams-jr|title =The Awkward, Enduring Influence of Hank Williams, Jr.|magazine =The New Yorker|first =David|last =Cantwell|date =March 24, 2016}}</ref> After his father's death in 1953, he was raised by his mother, [[Audrey Williams]].

While he was a child, Williams was influenced by a <!--really? vast--> number of contemporary musicians who visited his family and taught him various musical instruments and styles. {{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Among these figures of influence were [[Merle Haggard]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. Williams first stepped onto the stage and sang his father's songs when he was eight years old.

He attended [[John Overton High School]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances with the choir.

== Career ==
In 1964, Williams made his recording debut with "[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]", one of his father's many classic songs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944–2006, Second edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=388 |language=en |isbn=0823082911 }}</ref>

He provided the singing voice of his father<ref name="pc9">{{Pop Chronicles |9 |4|Hank Williams Jr.}}</ref> in the 1964 film ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058765/ |title=Your Cheatin' Heart |date=December 1, 1964 |website=IMDb.com}}</ref> He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.<ref name="pc9" />

===A change in appearance and musical direction===
Although Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a "Hank Williams impersonator", he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.

By the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a pattern of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to [[Alabama]], in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with [[Southern rock]] musicians including [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Toy Caldwell]], and [[Charlie Daniels]]. ''[[Hank Williams Jr. and Friends]]'' (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.

On August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed while mountain climbing in southwestern [[Montana]]. While climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] ([[Idaho]] border) west of [[Jackson, Montana|Jackson]], the snow beneath Williams collapsed and he fell almost {{convert|500|ft}} onto rock, causing multiple severe skull and facial fractures.<ref name=singfll>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8R9OAAAAIBAJ&pg=1923%2C4536621 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Singer injured in fall |date=August 11, 1975 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-01-11-williams-miner-visit_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=USA Today | title=Hank Williams visits W.Va. mine survivor | date=January 11, 2006}}</ref> Williams spent two years recovering, re-learning how to talk and sing, and undergoing 17 surgeries to repair his skull and reconstruct his face. The accident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film ''[[Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story]]''. To hide his scars and disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a [[cowboy hat]]. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become Williams' [[trademark look|signature look]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

In 1977, Williams recorded and released ''One Night Stands'' and ''The New South'', and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song "Once and For All".{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} In 1980, he appeared on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-[[Dana Cooper]] Band.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

In 1976, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that Williams' "mainstream country material has always been among [[Nashville Tennessee|Nashville]]{{'}}s best".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Hank Williams Jr.: Hank William Jr. and Friends. By John Morthland : Articles, reviews and interviews from Rock's Backpages.| access-date = June 25, 2018| url = https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/hank-williams-jr-ihank-william-jr-and-friendsi|via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

He was prolific throughout the 1980s, sometimes recording and releasing two albums a year. ''[[Family Tradition (album)|Family Tradition]]'', ''[[Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound (album)|Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound]]'', ''[[Habits Old and New]]'', ''[[Rowdy (Hank Williams, Jr. album)|Rowdy]]'', ''[[The Pressure Is On]]'', ''[[High Notes]]'', ''[[Strong Stuff]]'', ''[[Man of Steel (album)|Man of Steel]]'', ''[[Major Moves (album)|Major Moves]]'', ''[[Five-O (album)|Five-O]]'', ''[[Montana Cafe]]'', and many others resulted in a long string of hits.

Between 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums—18 studio albums and three compilations—that were all certified at least [[Music recording certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No.&nbsp;1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No.&nbsp;1 singles, during his career.

In 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987–88, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the [[Academy of Country Music]]. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was ''[[Born to Boogie (album)|Born to Boogie]]''.

During the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams' songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as "Family Tradition", "Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound", "Old Habits", "Ain't Misbehavin{{'"}}, "[[Born to Boogie (song)|Born to Boogie]]", and "My Name Is Bocephus".

The hit single "[[Wild Streak]]" (1987) was co-written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]], for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records. In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, "[[If the South Woulda Won]]". The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

His 1989 hit "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]" was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named ''Video of the Year'' by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].

He is well known for his hit "[[A Country Boy Can Survive]]" and as the performer of the theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', based on his 1984 hit "[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]". In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for ''Monday Night Football'' earned him four [[Emmy Award]]s. 
[[File:Hank Williams, Jr. (2006).jpg|thumb|Williams in 2006]]
In 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]''. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit "A Country Boy Can Survive" after 9/11, renaming it "America Can Survive". In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on ''CMT Outlaws''. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.

He has also made a cameo appearance along with [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Kid Rock]], and [[Charlie Daniels]] in [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s music video for the song "[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]". He and Kid Rock also appeared in Wilson's "[[Redneck Woman]]" video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock's video "Only God Knows Why", and "Redneck Paradise".

In April 2009, Williams released a new single, "Red, White & Pink-Slip Blues", which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams' album ''[[127 Rose Avenue]]''. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, ''127 Rose Avenue'' was announced as his last album for Curb Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725202808/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 25, 2009|title=Hank Williams Jr. says new album is his last for Curb Records|last=Morris|first=Edward|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2009}}</ref>

In November 2008, Williams considered a run for the 2012 Republican nomination as a [[U.S. Senator]] from Tennessee for the seat held by GOP incumbent [[Bob Corker]], although his publicist said regarding Williams "no announcement has been made".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2008/11/25/hank-williams-jr-for-senate |title=Hank Williams Jr. For Senate? - Real Clear Politics – TIME.com |publisher=Realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com |date=November 25, 2008 |access-date=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128170506/http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2008/11/25/hank-williams-jr-for-senate/|archive-date=January 28, 2012 }}</ref> Williams ultimately did not run.

===2011 ''Fox and Friends'' controversy===
In an October 3, 2011, interview with [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', Williams discussed a June golf game where President [[Barack Obama]] and Republican House Speaker [[John Boehner]] had teamed against Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]], saying the match was "one of the biggest political mistakes ever". When asked why the golf game troubled him, Williams stated, "Come on. That'd be like Hitler playing golf with [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]&nbsp;... in the shape this country is in?" He also said that the President and Vice President were "the enemy" and compared them to "the [[Three Stooges]]". Later, anchor [[Gretchen Carlson]] said to him, "You used the name of one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe, ''I think'', the president." Williams replied, "Well, that is true. But I'm telling you like it is." As a result of his statements, [[ESPN]] dropped Williams' opening song from its ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] versus the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and replaced it with the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Williams later said his analogy was "extreme – but it was to make a point", and "some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood&nbsp;... I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me – how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don't see eye to eye and never will". Additionally, Williams said he has "always respected the office of the president ... Working-class people are hurting – and it doesn't seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change". ESPN later said it was "extremely disappointed" in Williams' comments, and pulled his opening from that night's broadcast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |title=ESPN pulls Hank Williams Jr. intro after singer links Obama with Hitler |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=October 3, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113134647/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |archive-date=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

Three days later, ESPN announced Williams and his song would not return to ''Monday Night Football'', ending the use of the song that had been part of the broadcast on both ABC and ESPN since 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7066449/espn-hank-williams-jr-theme-song-return-monday-night-football|title=ESPN, Hank Williams Jr. part ways|date=October 6, 2010|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Williams expressed defiance and indifference on his website, and said he was the one who had made the decision. "After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision," he wrote. "By pulling my opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE. It's been a great run."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7066449/espn-hank-williams-jr-theme-song-return-monday-night-football |title=ESPN – Hank Williams Jr. theme song won't return to Monday Night Football – ESPN |publisher=ESPN |date=October 6, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011}}</ref> Williams' son, [[Hank Williams III]], stayed neutral in the debate, telling [[TMZ.com]] that most musicians, including his father, are "not worthy" of a political discussion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/10/04/hank-williams-jr-monday-night-football-son-politics-obama-hitler-fox-news-channel-jello-biafra-green-party-politics/ |title=Hank Williams Jr.'s Son – My Dad Should NOT Talk Politics |publisher=TMZ.com |date=November 22, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011}}</ref>

After his song was pulled from ''Monday Night Football,'' Williams recorded a song criticizing Obama, ESPN and ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', titled "[[Keep the Change (Hank Williams Jr. song)|Keep the Change]]". He released the track on [[iTunes]] and via free download at his website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2011/10/hank-williams-jr-retaliates-with-song-that-slams-fox/1|title=Hank Williams Jr. retaliates with song that slams Fox|first=Tom|last=Weir|date=October 10, 2011|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> The song garnered over 180,000 downloads in two days.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1672429/hank-williams-jr-thrives-with-downloads-media-coverage-surrounding-controversy.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104416/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1672429/hank-williams-jr-thrives-with-downloads-media-coverage-surrounding-controversy.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 14, 2011|title=Hank Williams Jr. Thrives With Downloads, Media Coverage Surrounding Controversy|date=October 12, 2011|publisher=[[CMT News]]}}</ref>

Williams continued to make his opinions of Obama known and during a performance at the Iowa State Fair in August 2012, [[Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories|he called Obama a Muslim]] telling the crowd, "We've got a Muslim president who hates farming, hates the military, hates the U.S. and we hate him!"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/hank-williams-jr-tells-crowd-obama-muslim-hates/story?id=17042110|title=Country Star Calls Obama 'a Muslim'|date=August 20, 2012|publisher=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Couch |first=Aaron |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/hank-williams-jr-songs-barack-obama-363946/ |title=Hank Williams Jr. Calls Obama 'Muslim' Who 'Hates The Military'|work=[[Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 18, 2012 |access-date=July 5, 2023 |archive-date=July 5, 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230705214720/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/hank-williams-jr-songs-barack-obama-363946/}}</ref>

== Career ==
When Isbell was a teenager, many musicians took him under their wing.<ref name=RollingStone-SXSW-2011 /> He got to know session bassist [[David Hood]], father of [[Drive-By Truckers]] co-founder [[Patterson Hood]], because David Hood was in the [[Florence, Alabama]] area and played around town on Friday and Saturday nights in local restaurants and bars. By this time, Patterson Hood and his future Drive-By Truckers co-founder, [[Mike Cooley (musician)|Mike Cooley]],  were older and had moved out of town. Isbell would go watch David Hood and others perform. After he eventually found the nerve to tell them he played the guitar, they invited him to join them onstage, which resulted in friendship and mentorship.<ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 />

Isbell submitted demos and eventually got a publishing deal with [[FAME Studios]] of [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], when he was 21. He worked with FAME for 15 years, through his solo album ''Southeastern''. Isbell also recorded pieces of his solo albums at FAME Studios, as well as the Drive-By Truckers' ''The Dirty South''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://famestudios.com/jason-isbell/|title = Jason Isbell & the 400 Unit – Fame Studios| date=September 28, 2018 }}</ref>

==Early life==
Fogerty was born in [[Berkeley, California]], and grew up in [[El Cerrito, California]], the third of five boys born to Galen Robert and Edith Lucile (Lytle) Fogerty. His father was born in [[Iowa]], and worked as a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator for the ''Berkeley Gazette'' in California. Lucile Fogerty taught second grade and was from [[Great Falls, Montana]]. John first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley, California. In his memoir, ''Fortunate Son'', Fogerty was critical of the school, saying when in class he was not permitted to go to the bathroom when he asked, and frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his wet clothing.<ref name="fortunate">{{Cite book|last=Fogerty|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/917202092|title=Fortunate son : my life, my music|date=2015|others=Jimmy McDonough|isbn=978-0-316-24457-2|location=New York|oclc=917202092}}</ref>

After one year, Fogerty enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School. In his book, he stated that his parents were [[alcoholic]]s and that they divorced when he was in the third or fourth grade.<ref name="fortunate"/> He later attended [[Saint Mary's College High School|St. Mary's High School]], then transferred to [[El Cerrito High School]], where he met the other future members of CCR and took guitar lessons from Berkeley Folk Festival creator/producer [[Barry Olivier]].<ref name="fortunate"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Hurd Anyaso|first=Hilary|title=Founder of Berkeley Folk Festival to Visit Northwestern|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2011/05/folk-festival-berkeley.html|website=Northwestern.edu|date=May 2011|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> Fogerty's older brother Tom was a guitarist and bandmate in the group that eventually became CCR.

While in junior high school in 1959, Fogerty formed a [[cover band]] with [[bassist]] Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford called the Blue Velvets. The band was inspired by [[rock and roll]] pioneers, especially [[Little Richard]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/levitin/fogerty.html |title=John Fogerty|website=Psych.mcgill.ca|access-date=2009-08-10|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715024129/http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/levitin/fogerty.html|archive-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> and [[Bo Diddley]]. Later, Fogerty's brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with [[Fantasy Records]], which, without the band's knowledge or approval, changed the band's name from the Blue Velvets to [[The Golliwogs]]. This group recorded seven singles that were not commercially successful.<ref name="hall-of-fame">{{cite web|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/creedence-clearwater-revival|website=rockhall.com|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=July 24, 2017|date=1993}}</ref>

==Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968–1972)==
{{Main|Creedence Clearwater Revival}}
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival 1968.jpg|thumb|right|Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1968, from left to right: [[Tom Fogerty]], [[Doug Clifford]], [[Stu Cook]], and John Fogerty]]
After Fogerty's military service, the Golliwogs resumed playing, releasing an album in late 1967. In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|eponymous debut album]] and also had their first hit single, "[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with "[[Proud Mary]]" and the album ''[[Bayou Country (album)|Bayou Country]]''.

Fogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band.<ref>{{cite journal|date=January 1998|title=Blue Moon Rising: The John Fogerty Interview (Cover Story)|journal=Audio Magazine}}</ref> These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, ''[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]'', released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit "[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]", and "[[Someday Never Comes]]", which made it into the ''Billboard'' Top 20.

Cook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept ''Mardi Gras'' as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, "My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs."{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} According to the two bandmates, Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or 
Fogerty would quit immediately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/07/doug-clifford-ccr-john-fogerty/29792885/ |title= Interview: Doug Clifford on CCR and John Fogerty |website= azcentral |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2022}} They accepted Fogerty's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status, though it generated weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly after the album was released.

The only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th El Cerrito high school class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion.

Even early in his career, “Fogerty's attitude toward music [was] serious, practiced, even perfectionistic. He drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal, insisting that his songs be performed his way. ...[He] was known for not indulging in drugs, and although John struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances.” <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sandefur |first1=Timothy |title=John Fogerty's Disciplined Focus |journal=The Objective Standard |volume=14 |issue= 4 |pages=84–85 |publisher=Glen Allen Press |date=Winter 2019 |url=https://theobjectivestandard.com/2019/08/john-fogertys-disciplined-focus/}}</ref> “Not in my band,” he writes in his memoir, ''Fortunate Son''. “You dare not be stoned playing music around me....

== Solo career ==
=== 1972–1985 ===
As CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of [[country and western]] [[Cover version|covers]], on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers—a band of which he was the only member.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=476}}</ref>

The eponymous ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]'' was released in 1973; it spun off the [[top 20|top-20]] hit "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]", as well as a lesser hit in "Hearts of Stone".<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty, still using "The Blue Ridge Rangers" name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single: "You Don't Owe Me" b/w "Back in the Hills" (Fantasy F-710). It was a commercial flop, failing to make the US [[Billboard Hot 100]], though "You Don't Owe Me" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 79. Fogerty thereafter abandoned the "Blue Ridge Rangers" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name.<ref name="Larkin"/> In early 1974, Fogerty released "Comin' Down The Road"&mdash;backed with the instrumental "Ricochet".

His first official solo album, ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]'', was released in 1975.<ref name="Larkin"/> Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded "[[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|Rockin' All Over the World]]", a No. 27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, the British rock band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] recorded their version of "Rockin' All Over the World", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous.<ref name="Larkin"/> Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert.

In 1976, Fogerty finished an album called ''[[Hoodoo (John Fogerty album)|Hoodoo]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> A single, "You Got the Magic" backed with "Evil Thing", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by [[Asylum Records]] a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for ''Hoodoo'' sometime in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/hoodoo_john_fogertys_lost_occult_tinged_disco_rock_album |title= 'Hoodoo', John Fogerty's Lost, Occult-Tinged Disco Album |website= Dangerous Minds |date= May 20, 2016 |access-date= April 15, 2020}}</ref>

===1985–1997===
{{See also|The Old Man Down the Road|Fogerty v. Fantasy}}
After a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]'', his first album for [[Warner Bros. Records]], which had taken co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty.<ref name="Larkin"/> ''Centerfield'' went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in "[[The Old Man Down the Road]]".<ref name="Larkin"/> The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty.

Two songs on the album, "Zanz Kant Danz" and "Mr. Greed", were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at [[Fantasy Records]], [[Saul Zaentz]].<ref name="Larkin"/> "Zanz Kant Danz" was about a pig that cannot dance, but would "steal your money". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: "Vanz Kant Danz" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (''Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty'') claimed that "The Old Man Down the Road" shared the same chorus as "[[Run Through the Jungle]]", a song from Fogerty's days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights.<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions and also that sounding like himself was not plagiarizing. Fogerty then [[counterclaim|countersued]] for attorney fees (''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]''). After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs.<ref name="Larkin"/>

On May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called ''John Fogerty's All-Stars''. The setlist consisted of [[rhythm and blues]] tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the ''Centerfield'' LP and the song "No Love in You" written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the [[Textones]]' debut album ''Midnight Mission'' and he later recorded with Textones' band leader Carla Olson. ''John Fogerty's All-Stars'' was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&M Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included [[Albert Lee]], [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Duck Dunn]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], and [[Prairie Prince]].

The follow-up album to ''Centerfield'' was ''[[Eye of the Zombie]]'' in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor.<ref name="Larkin"/> Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. ''Eye of the Zombie'' took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the ''Eye of the Zombie'' tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, "Change in the Weather" was included in the setlist for his 2009 tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year's solo release, ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.

Fogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, D.C., for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on [[HBO]]. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at [[Oakland Coliseum]] for the Concert Against AIDS. His backing band that night consisted of [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] on guitars, [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, and [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maniacpaul.thejakubowskis.com/details.php?b_id=112v|title=John Fogerty – In Concert Against AIDS |year=2004 |publisher=thejakubowskis.com|access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 1990, his brother Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, survived by his second wife and six children. Tom contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. Specifically, he died from a tuberculosis infection. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were barely speaking to each other.<ref>VH1 Legends: John Fogerty—''Viacom International, VH1, 1996''</ref> In fact, even in the brothers' very last conversation with each other, Tom at one point referred to Creedence Clearwater Revival's former manager Saul Zaentz as his "best friend".<ref name= "Autobiography"/> Given that Zaentz had swindled the band out of millions of dollars and had just recently attempted to sue John, this revelation made it painfully difficult for John to reconcile with Tom. In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: "We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview|title=John Fogerty: 'I had rules.

Fogerty traveled to [[Mississippi]] in 1990 for inspiration, and visited the gravesite of blues legend [[Robert Johnson]]. According to him, while there, he had the realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, thus Fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old CCR material regularly in concert.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1518067/john-fogerty-embraces-his-past.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510095507/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1518067/john-fogerty-embraces-his-past.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2008|title=John Fogerty Embraces His Past|last=Gilbert|first=Calvin|date=December 13, 2005|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] News|access-date=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/ENT0501/807310303/1052/ENT|title=John Fogerty's epiphany at a bluesman's plot|last=Spevak|first=Jeff|date=July 31, 2008|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|access-date=2008-08-02|archive-date=December 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220064118/http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/ENT0501/807310303/1052/ENT|url-status=dead}}</ref> At this time, visiting the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church cemetery, Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation, the [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]], to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty subsequently funded headstones for [[Charlie Patton]], [[James Thomas (blues musician)|James “Son” Thomas]], [[Mississippi Joe Callicott]], Eugene Powell, and [[Lonnie Pitchford]], and helped with financial arrangements for numerous others.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9901E0D9163CF933A0575AC0A961958260.html |title=Homage at Last for Blues Makers; Through a Fan's Crusade, Unmarked Graves Get Memorials |last=Yellin|first=Emily|date=September 30, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2008-06-10}}</ref>

Creedence Clearwater Revival was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony, citing the Zaentz lawsuit as a reason. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]] in performing three songs: "[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]", "[[Born on the Bayou]]", and "[[Green River (song)|Green River]]".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sweeting|first1=Adam|title=The saddest story in rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3|access-date=March 30, 2015|work=theguardian.com|date=July 11, 2000}}</ref> The other two surviving members were believed to have laughed it off in disappointment. During the induction speech, Springsteen said, "As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty]. He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. Funny, too. He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and he got out of there."<ref>Barker, Derek (2009). Liner notes to ''Bruce Springsteen's Jukebox: The Songs that Inspired the Man'' [CD].

===1997–present===

[[File:John Forgerty in 2000.jpg|thumb|Fogerty in Washington, D.C., in 1998]]

Fogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 with ''[[Blue Moon Swamp]]''. The layoff between ''Zombie'' and ''Swamp'' had been longer than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful than ''Zombie'' and won the [[Grammy]] for best rock album in 1997. A live album, named ''[[Premonition (John Fogerty album)|Premonition]]'', of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour, was released to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998. A track from ''Blue Moon Swamp'' titled "Blue Moon Nights," was used in the 2002 film ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''.

On October 1, 1998, Fogerty was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 7000 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Calendar/CalendarPast2.shtml#walk |title=Recent Hollywood Events |website=Seeing-stars.com |access-date=2010-03-30}}</ref>

In 2004, Fogerty released ''[[Deja Vu All Over Again (album)|Deja Vu All Over Again]]'' through [[DreamWorks Records]], which had taken over distribution of Fogerty's Warner catalog. ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: "The title track is Fogerty's indictment of the [[Iraq War]] as another [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], a senseless squandering of American lives and power". On the album, Fogerty squeezed ten songs into only 34 minutes.

The sale of Fantasy Records to [[Concord Records]] in 2004 ended the 30-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label, as the new owners took steps to restore [[royalties|royalty]] rights Fogerty had given up to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid-1970s. In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records, made possible when DreamWorks Records' noncountry-music unit was absorbed by [[Geffen Records]], which dropped Fogerty, but continued to distribute his earlier solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was ''[[The Long Road Home (album)|The Long Road Home]]'' (November 2005), a compilation CD combining his CCR hits with solo material. A live CD and concert [[The Long Road Home - In Concert|DVD]] were released the following year.

Fogerty's touring schedule increased in the period after ''Deja Vu All Over Again''. In October 2004, Fogerty appeared on the [[Vote for Change]] tour, playing seven of the concerts in U.S. [[swing states]]. He also appeared in a Christmas special video produced by the Australian children's group [[The Wiggles]]. <!-- "Centerfield" was also played at the 2008 Republican National Convention when John McCain introduced Sarah Palin as his running mate. Fogerty's numbers were played with [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]].--> Fogerty toured with [[John Mellencamp]] in the summer of 2005 and with [[Willie Nelson]] in the summer of 2006. On June 29, 2006, he played his first headlining British concert since 1972, at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] theater in London, as part of the European leg of the tour. During that leg, he also performed in Sundsvall, Sweden, where 25,000 people came to see him perform at the town square. On Thanksgiving Day of 2006, Fogerty performed at halftime at the [[Miami Dolphins]]/[[Detroit Lions]] game and at the [[Denver Broncos]]/[[Kansas City Chiefs]] halftime later that evening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/thanksgiving |title=''NFL.com'', 20 November 2006 |website=Nfl.com |date=November 23, 2009 |access-date=2010-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403094240/http://www.nfl.com/thanksgiving |archive-date=April 3, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregamehalftime.com/ |title=Website for the Kansas City/Denver Thanksgiving game halftime promoters |website=Pregamehalftime.com |date=September 13, 2009 |access-date=2010-03-30}}</ref><ref>[http://kcchiefs.com/news/2006/11/13/broncos_vs_chiefs__1123__volunteers_needed Thanksgiving game – Volunteers needed!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181654/http://kcchiefs.com/news/2006/11/13/broncos_vs_chiefs__1123__volunteers_needed |date=September 30, 2007 }} ''KCChiefs.com'', November 13, 2006.</ref>

Fogerty was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2005.

In 2005, Fogerty received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] presented by Awards Council member [[B.B.

On February 10, 2008, Fogerty appeared with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]] on the [[Grammy Awards]] show. Along with these rock icons and his regular touring band, he played his 1973 single "Comin' Down The Road", leading into Lewis and Richard's performances of "Great Balls of Fire" and "Good Golly Miss Molly", respectively.

On March 16, 2008, Fogerty kicked off an Australian tour.

==Biography==
During the 1970s, Van Zant performed with his first band, the Austin Nickels Band. They later changed their name to [[The Johnny Van Zant Band]] releasing their debut solo album, ''[[No More Dirty Deals]]'', in 1980. Early members of the Johnny Van Zant Band consisted of Van Zant on lead vocals, Robbie Gay on guitar, Danny Clausman, on bass, Erik Lundgren on lead guitar, Robbie Morris, drums and [[Joan Hecht]] (previously Joan Cusimano) and Nancy Henderson on background vocals. Van Zant released three more solo albums between 1981 and 1985, before taking a break from the music business.

He became lead vocalist and chief songwriter for the reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987 and continues to record and perform with them today. He released another solo album, ''Brickyard Road'', in 1990, which featured the popular title track, which was a #1 hit on the U.S. [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for three weeks. He also records and performs with his brother, Donnie, as [[Van Zant (band)|Van Zant]] since 1998. Van Zant and Lynyrd Skynyrd performed in Arizona on April 9, 2022, during Arizona Bike Week at WestWorld of Scottsdale. He stated that original member [[Gary Rossington]] was recovering and still needed prayers.

In May 2006, less than one day before he was to perform at [[KSAN (FM)|KSAN-FM]] 107.7 ''The Bone's Bone Bash 7'', Van Zant underwent emergency surgery to have his [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] removed. Treated at [[Stanford University Medical Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], after reporting pain to a doctor earlier in the day. The incident forced the band to cancel three U.S. shows.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4997130.stm Notice of Johnny Van Zant surgery], bbc.co.uk; accessed August 11, 2015.</ref>

Van Zant is a fan of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. He recorded a video, along with remaining members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, that is played at every Jaguars home game on the [[TIAA Bank Field]] video board.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-08-31 |title=Jaguars and Skynyrd a Natural Fit |url=https://www.samsportsline.com/jaguars-and-skynyrd-a-natural-fit/ |access-date=2022-05-11 |website=Jacksonville Sports News, Sam Kouvaris SamSportsline.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

According to Skynyrd's website, Van Zant was again hospitalized on August 6, 2011, at the [[Hennepin County Medical Center]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], due to complications from a previous surgery. According to the website, Van Zant had a "surgical site" infected with [[cellulitus]] which required both hospitalization and IV/Antibiotic treatment. He began displaying signs of a [[staphylococcal infection|staph infection]] and other symptoms related to the infection. His subsequent illness resulted in a number of scheduled performances being cancelled.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Newton|first=Steve|date=2011-08-11|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd's Johnny Van Zant hospitalized, numerous shows cancelled {{!}} Georgia Straight Vancouver's News & Entertainment Weekly|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/lynyrd-skynyrds-johnny-van-zant-hospitalized-numerous-shows-cancelled|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005923/http://www.straight.com/blogra/lynyrd-skynyrds-johnny-van-zant-hospitalized-numerous-shows-cancelled|archive-date=2016-03-05|access-date=2022-02-06|website=[[The Georgia Straight]]|language=en}}</ref>

'''Lonnie McIntosh''' (July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016), known as '''Lonnie Mack''', was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. He was influential in the development of [[blues rock]] music and [[rock music|rock]] [[guitar solo]]ing.

Mack emerged in 1963 with his breakthrough LP, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. It earned him lasting renown as both a [[blue-eyed soul]] singer<ref name="Davidson">{{Cite web |last=Davidson |first=Merric |date=2016-05-18 |title=Lonnie Mack |url=https://www.toppermost.co.uk/lonnie-mack/ |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Toppermost |language=en-US}}</ref> and a [[lead guitar]] innovator. The album's instrumental tracks included two hit singles, "Memphis" and "Wham". In them, Mack, using "top-quality technique" and "pristine" phrasing,<ref>{{Citation |title=British guitarist analyses Lonnie Mack and Stevie Ray Vaughan live in 1986! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaE2tN8dUx0 |access-date=2023-12-13 |language=en}}</ref> added "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" melodies and runs to the predominant chords-and-riffs pattern of early rock guitar.<ref name="auto">Hagood, "[https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ Lonnie Mack: Remembering His Trailblazing Blues-Rock Guitar Virtuosity]", Website:"Keeping the Blues Alive", April 29, 2016. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826121524/https://keepingthebluesalive.org/lonnie-mack-remembering-his-trailblazing-blues-rock-guitar-virtuosity/ |date=August 26, 2018 }}</ref> These tracks raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency,<ref>Interviewed for [[Duane Allman]]'s 2006 biography, guitarist Mike Johnstone recalled sixteen-year-old Allman's fascination with ''Memphis'', saying: "Now, at that time, there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.'"

Music historian [[Dick Shurman]], as quoted McCardle, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74]", Washington Post, April 25, 2016. Mack was a strong influence on several founders of Southern rock: (1) [[Allman Brothers]] lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]]: "People like Dickey Betts would tell you that without Lonnie they wouldn't be who they were. That goes for all of us." April 23, 2016, posting on Official Warren Haynes website, preserved at http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack; (2) Before finding fame as lead guitarist of the Allman Brothers, seventeen-year-old [[Duane Allman]] honed his soloing skills by playing ''Memphis'' along with Mack's record, repeatedly stopping and starting the record with his foot, until he had mastered Mack's technique. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, p. 10 ''et seq''.). (3) Remembering the unchallenging simplicity of early rock guitar, Allman Brothers co-lead guitarist, Dickey Betts, observed: "I was really gettin' tired of all the beach songs, and "Louie, Louie". Those are great songs, but I'm talkin' about ''guitar-playing''. And then, here come Lonnie Mack, right down the middle of it all. God, what a breath of fresh air that was for me." Betts video commentary at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij-LTAFB9o8; (4) Mack was a significant influence on two founders of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Steve Gaines]] and [[Ed King]]. Odom, ''Lynyrd Skynyrd: Remembering The Free Birds Of Southern Rock'', Broadway Books 2002, at p. 142. Before Gaines' rise to Skynyrd fame, he practiced "playing (''Memphis'') by ear until he could imitate" Mack, who was one of Gaines' "favorite artists". ''Id.'' Gaines can be heard singing and playing Mack's "Why" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAXU_-q3srs.</ref> that soon followed.

Shortly after the album's release, however, the [[British Invasion]] hit American shores, and Mack's recording career "withered on the vine".<ref>Puterbaugh, "[https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-british-invasion-from-the-beatles-to-the-stones-the-sixties-belonged-to-britain-244870/ The British Invasion: From the Beatles to the Stones, The Sixties Belonged to Britain]", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', July 14, 1988.

He was soon performing in major venues, but his multi-genre Elektra albums downplayed his lead guitar and blues rock appeal and record sales were modest. During this period, he became increasingly unhappy with the music business. He left Elektra in 1971, and for the next fourteen years he functioned as a low-profile multi-genre recording artist, roadhouse performer, sideman, and music-venue proprietor.

He continued to perform, mostly in small venues, until 2004.<ref name="auto1">See section below entitled "Career chronology".</ref>

== Early life and musical influences ==

Shortly before Mack's birth, his family moved from [[Appalachia]]n (eastern) [[Kentucky]] to [[Dearborn County]], [[Indiana]], on the banks of the Ohio River.<ref>During the migration of refugees from the coal mine closures in Southern Appalachia before World War II, most sought jobs in industrialized cities.  However, Mack's parents settled twenty miles downriver from Cincinnati, living and working on sharecropping farms.</ref> One of five children, he was born to parents Robert and Sarah Sizemore McIntosh on July 18, 1941, in [[West Harrison]], Indiana,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Mack, July 18, 1941 – April 21, 2016|url=http://www.alligator.com/news/index.cfm/nid/689/t/Lonnie-Mack|website=Alligator.com}}</ref> near Cincinnati, Ohio. He was raised on a series of nearby [[sharecropping]] farms.

Using a floor-model radio powered by a truck battery, his family routinely listened to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' [[country music]] show. Continuing to listen after the rest of the family had retired for the night, Mack became a fan of [[rhythm and blues]] and [[traditional black gospel]] music.<ref>Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back of the Track", Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56.</ref>

He began playing guitar at the age of seven, after trading his bicycle for a [[Lone Ranger]] model acoustic guitar.<ref>(1) Forte, "Lonnie Mack: That Memphis Man is Back", 1978, p. 20; (2) Murrells, The Book of Golden Discs, Barrie & Jenkins, 1978, p.163</ref> His mother taught him basic chords,<ref name="Grimes" /> and he was soon playing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] guitar in the family band.<ref name="McArdle">{{Cite news |last=McArdle |first=Terence |date=2016-04-25 |title=Lonnie Mack, guitarist and singer who influenced blues and rock acts, dies at 74 |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html |access-date=2022-07-29 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Mack recalled that when he was "seven or eight years old" an uncle from Texas introduced him to [[blues]] guitar<ref name="merged1">{{cite AV media |date=March 13, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |title=Lonnie Mack Interview |publisher=John Broughton |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=October 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210105133502/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhZIMw99go |archive-date=January 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> and that when he was about ten years of age, an "old black man" named Wayne Clark introduced him to "[[Robert Johnson]] style guitar". He soon taught himself to merge finger-picking country guitar with acoustic blues-picking, to produce a hybrid style which, Mack said, "sounded like [[rockabilly]], but before rockabilly".<ref>(1) Hear Mack interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYxmVf6Xik (2) Van Matre, "Lonnie Mack Back In The Swing Of Things", Chicago Tribune, May 2, 1985, at [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-05-0]{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 2/features/8501270055_1_mack-doesn-t-stevie-ray-vaughan-lonnie-mack.

His musical influences remained diverse as he refined his playing and singing styles. In his pre-teen years, Mack was mentored by blind singer-guitarist Ralph Trotto, a [[country music|country]]-[[Gospel music|gospel]] performer.<ref name="liner notes to Memphis Wham!">(1) Bill Millar, liner notes to Ace (UK) early Mack compilation album entitled "Memphis Wham!".

== Career ==

Mack's career-long pattern of switching and mixing within the entire range of white and black Southern roots music genres<ref>His most popular albums, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963), ''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985), and ''Attack of the Killer V'' (1990) were blues-oriented with a rock instrumental bent and a [[traditional black gospel]] vocal bent. ''Dueling Banjos'' (1973) was an album of traditional bluegrass tunes. ''Glad I'm in the Band'' (1969) and ''Whatever's Right'' (1969) were ecletic with an emphasis on country and soul. ''The Hills of Indiana'' (1971) was almost entirely country, with a singer-songwriter emphasis. ''Coco's'' (1983) was a mix of traditional country, acoustic and electric blues, deep soul, blues-rock, and roots-rock. ''South'' (1978) was a mix of country-pop and bluegrass. ''Second Sight'' (1986) and ''Roadhouses and Dance Halls'' (1988) were eclectic mixes of rockabilly, roots-rock, and [[outlaw country]]. ''Home at Last'' (1977) was mostly country.

In the early 1960s he became a [[session musicians|session guitarist]] with [[Fraternity Records]], a small Cincinnati label. In 1963, he recorded two hit singles for Fraternity, the proto-blues-rock guitar instrumentals "Memphis" and "Wham!". He soon recorded additional tunes to flesh out his debut album, ''[[The Wham of that Memphis Man]]''. Mack made some notable recordings later, particularly in the 1980s,<ref>''Strike Like Lightning'' (1985) and ''Lonnie Mack Live: Attack of the Killer V'' (1990), were commercially successful and drew critical acclaim.</ref> but his debut album (released October 1963) is widely considered the centerpiece of his career. It became a perennial critics' favorite:

*1968: Guitar: "...in a class by himself."...Vocals: "...sincerity and intensity that's hard to find anywhere."<ref>Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man",''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968</ref> – Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'', calling for re-issuance of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album.
*1987: "With so many trying to copy this same style, this album sounds surprisingly modern. Not many have done it this well, though."<ref>Himes, "Lonnie Mack", ''The Washington Post'', February 20, 1987</ref> – Gregory Himes, ''The Washington Post''
*1992: "The first of the guitar-hero records is also one of the best, and for perhaps the last time, the singing on such a disc is worthy of the guitar histrionics."<ref name="Guterman 1992, p. 34">Guterman, "The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time", Citadel Publishing, 1992, p. 34 (ranking the album No. 16).</ref> – Jimmy Guterman, ranking the album No. 16 in ''The 100 Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time''
*2007: "...a spectacular feast of down-home blues, gospel, R&B, and country chicken-pickin'...a unique vision of American roots music [that was] five years ahead of the British blues-rockers."<ref>Rubin, "Inside the Blues, 1942–1982", Hal Leonard, 2007, at page 124.</ref> – Dave Rubin, ''Inside the Blues, 1942–1982''
*2016: "Of all the Mack material available this is the one [album] I'd regard as absolutely essential."<ref name="Davidson" /> – Dave Stephens, ''Toppermost''

He recorded many additional sides for Fraternity between 1963 and 1967, but few, if any, were broadly released or strongly promoted, and none charted.<ref>Apart from "Memphis" (Billboard #5) and Wham!" (Billboard #24), only two additional Mack Fraternity singles charted: "Honky-Tonk '65" (#78) and "Baby, What's Wrong?" (#93).

"It looked like the guitar wizard was ready to bust out when the music world was turned on its ear.

Although his recording career had stalled out, Mack stayed busy as a performer, criss-crossing the country with one-night stands. "The '60s, man, we was full of piss and vinegar, nothing bothered us. We had [[History and culture of substituted amphetamines#In music|bennies]], like the truckers had [and] we just stayed on the road all the time."<ref name="merged1" /> During that time, "[we] performed with just about everybody, [from] [[Jimi Hendrix]] [to] [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Dick and Dee Dee]]."<ref>McNutt, Guitar Towns, University of Indiana Press, 2002, at page 176.</ref> He also took on session work with [[James Brown]], [[Freddie King]], [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]], Albert Washington, and other R&B/soul artists.<ref>See, Mack discography at http://wdd.mbnet.fi/lonniemack.htm.

In 1968, at the height of the blues-rock era, [[Elektra Records]] bought out Mack's dormant Fraternity recording contract and moved him to Los Angeles to record three albums.<ref>Mack's three Elektra albums were ''[[Glad I'm in the Band]]'' (1969), ''[[Whatever's Right]]'' (1969), and ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'' (1971). These were eclectic collections of country and soul ballads, blues tunes, and updated versions of earlier recordings. Both 1969 albums emphasized Mack's vocals and de-emphasized his guitar work. They were modest commercial successes. Mack's final Elektra effort, ''The Hills of Indiana'', was a country album recorded in [[Nashville]] that attracted little attention.</ref> In November 1968, the newly founded ''Rolling Stone'' magazine published a rave review of Mack's discontinued 1963 debut album, persuading Elektra to re-issue it.<ref>(a) Alec Dubro, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, November 23, 1968. (b) Elektra obliged, adding two bonus tracks from 1964 (''Farther On Down The Road'' and ''Chicken-Pickin''), under the title "For Collectors Only".</ref> He was soon performing in major rock venues, including the [[Fillmore East]], the [[Fillmore West]], and the [[Cow Palace]]. He opened for [[the Doors]]<ref>{{Citation |title=The Doors – Blues For Lonnie |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zpNnje-GRs |language=en |access-date=2022-07-29}}</ref> and [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] and shared the stage with [[Johnny Winter]], [[Elvin Bishop]] and other popular rock and blues artists of the time.<ref>(1) Deccio, "Lonnie Mack Dead", April 24, 2016, http://www.inquisitr.com/3029420/lonnie-mack-dead-guitarist-and-vocalist-who-pioneered-blues-rock-dies-at-74/; (2) Poster for Mack's six-day run at the Fillmore West in July 1969 at http://www.classicposters.com/Johnny_Winter/poster/Bill_Graham/180; (3) Poster of Mack's Cow Palace appearance with the Doors and Elvin Bishop at http://www.classicposters.com/Lonnie_Mack; (4) Mack's reference to appearing with C, S &N at the Fillmore East in his 1985 Carnegie Hall interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHAcMm8pxvo.</ref>

It was the [[hippie]] era, however, and Mack's rustic, blue-collar persona made for a rough fit with commercial rock's target demographic. John Morthland wrote: "[All] the superior chops in the world couldn't hide the fact that chubby, country Mack probably had more in common with Kentucky truck drivers than he did with the new rock audience."<ref>(1) Morthland, "Lonnie Mack", ''Output'', March 1984; (2) "Lonnie was a real country boy". Elektra producer Russ Miller, in Holzman, ''Follow the Music'', First Media, 1998, p. 367.</ref> In addition, after two multi-genre Elektra albums (both recorded in 1969) that downplayed his blues-rock strengths, including his guitar, Mack himself was dissatisfied: "My music wasn't working that good then. I ain’t really happy with a lot of the stuff I did there."<ref>Mack, as quoted in McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}.</ref>

At that point in his career, Mack took a break from performing and recording. According to [[Robbie Krieger]], lead guitarist of Elektra label-mate the Doors, Mack was seen during this period "selling Bibles out of the back of his car."<ref>Graff, Doors celebrate 50 years of "Morrison Hotel:" Q&A, The Oakland Press, Oct. 9, 2020, at https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/doors-celebrate-50-years-of-morrison-hotel-q-a/article_2a9bc814-0a4d-11eb-b11f-277180eb19ef.html</ref> He also worked for Elektra's A&R department, helping to recruit new talent.<ref>Upon completing his 1969 albums, Mack assumed a "[[Chet Atkins]]-[[Eric Clapton]] role at Elektra, doing studio dates, producing and A&R." (''Rolling Stone'', "Random Notes", February 7, 1970, p. 4,) In that role, he helped to recruit a number of country and blues artists from Nashville, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Elektra considered the launch of a specialty label to record them. (Holzman, ''Follow The Music'', First Media, 1998, pp. 366–67.) Mack was instrumental in signing [[Mickey Newbury]], but could not generate much interest in some other prospects, including [[Roberta Flack]]. (Houghton, ''Becoming Elektra'', 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246.) He then tried to sign [[Carole King]], but Elektra rejected her on the grounds that they already had [[Judy Collins]]. (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3.) Frustrated, he finally attempted to interest Elektra in gospel singer [[Dorothy Combs Morrison]], the former lead vocalist for the [[Edwin Hawkins Singers]] of "Oh Happy Day" fame. Mack had recorded Morrison singing a gospel-esque version of [[The Beatles]]' "Let It Be", and sought permission to release it; management's response was delayed, however, due to ongoing negotiations for the label's sale to Warner Brothers (Kot, Greg (December 13, 1989). "He Wrote The Book – tribunedigital-chicagotribune" (http://articles.chicagotribune.c{{dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} om/1989-12-13/features/8903170595_1_doors-morrison-hotel-memphis-man-lonnie-mack). Articles.chicagotribune.com. Retrieved August 18, 2015.), allowing a competing label to seize the initiative and release [[Aretha Franklin]]'s own gospel version first. "That bummed me out" (Gettleman, ''Orlando Sentinel'', "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", as reprinted in ''Salt Lake Tribune'', August 3–4, 1993, p. 3), Mack said. According to a close associate, Mack "had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business". (Hear, interview of Stuart Holman (Mack's bass-player in the early '70s), "Lonnie Mack Special", July 16, 2011, at
http://wvxu.org/post/lonnie-mack-special#stream/0.) Finally, Mack resigned from his A&R job. (Sandmel, "Lonnie Mack is Back on the Track", ''Guitar World'', May 1984, pp. 59–60.)</ref> In 1971, with one album left to complete his contract with Elektra, Mack moved to [[Nashville]]. There, he recorded ''[[The Hills of Indiana]]'', a multi-genre (but country-flavored) LP with a vocal emphasis.<ref name="Davidson" /> It included only one track showcasing his guitar virtuosity, "Asphalt Outlaw Hero". ''The Hills of Indiana'' attracted little attention.

Mack had begun missing the fun of small-town performance venues early in his time with Elektra<ref>Mary Campbell, "Blues Guitarist Mack Is Back", Terre Haute Tribune-Star, November 2, 1969, p. 66.</ref> and soon soured on the fantasy of rock celebrity status. "[It had] a lot to do with how much value you put on money as opposed to what makes you happy. I wasn't happy. So one of the best-feeling moments I ever had was when that L.A. sign was in my rear-view mirror and I was free again."<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train.&pg=PA73 Mack's departure from the LA rock scene apparently also involved a threatening premonition. Towards the end of Mack's time at Elektra, the label had put together a musical whistle-stop touring group, including Mack, Don Nix, and others, billed as "The Alabama State Troupers and Mount Zion Choir". (Holzman, Follow The Music, First Media, 2000, p. 36.) According to Elektra producer Russ Miller, Mack disappeared six days before the tour was to begin. Miller found him hiding out on his rustic Kentucky farm. Mack refused to join the tour, citing a nightmare during his last night in Los Angeles, in which he and his family had been pursued by Satan. He had awakened in a sweat, finding his Bible opened to a passage warning him to "flee from Mount Zion". Miller, a former evangelist preacher (Houghton, Becoming Elektra, 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, pp.244–246), knew Mack's mind. Returning to California alone, Miller explained: "[Lonnie's] a real country boy. [T]hat was it for Lonnie". (Holzman, ''supra''). Mack wrote a tune relating to this experience. In "A Song I Haven't Sung" (1986), he equated the pursuit of "fortune and fame" with selling one's soul to Satan, allowing the "body to live while your soul is left to rot". The tune appears on Mack's 1986 Alligator album, "Second Sight".</ref> On another occasion, Mack said: "Seems like every time I get close to really making it, to climbing to the top of the mountain, that's when I pull out. I just pull up and run."<ref>Mack, as quoted in Guralnick, Pickers, "Lonnie Mack: Fiery Picker Goes Country", 1977, pp. 16–18.</ref> Upon Mack's death in 2016, music historian [[Dick Shurman]] observed that Mack's temperament "wasn't suited to stardom. I think he'd rather have been hunting and fishing. He didn't like cities or the (music) business."<ref>(1) Dick Shurman, as quoted in McArdle, "Lonnie Mack, Guitarist and Singer Who Influenced Blues and Rock Acts, Dies at 74", [[Washington Post]] April 25, 2016, at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/lonnie-mack-guitarist-and-singer-who-influenced-blues-and-rock-acts-dies-at-74/2016/04/25/5c581f3c-0a44-11e6-bfa1-4efa856caf2a_story.html.1]{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}). (2) Shurman's observation about Mack's dislike of cities finds support in the lyrics of two Mack tunes: (a) "L.A. made me sick." (''A Long Way From Memphis'', 1985); (b) (''Country'', 1976). (3) Shurman's observation about Mack's dislike of the music business was echoed by Stuart Holman, Mack's bass guitarist in the early 1970s: "Lonnie had no tolerance for the internal politics of the music business."

In 1971, with his Elektra contract completed, Mack went home to southern Indiana, where, for more than a decade, he was a roadhouse performer, [[sideman]], and low-profile country/bluegrass recording artist.<ref>{{Citation |title=Hey Dixie by Dobie Gray – RYM/Sonemic |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/dobie-gray/hey-dixie/ |language=en |access-date=2022-07-29}}</ref> During this period, he also owned and operated a nightclub in Covington, Kentucky, and an outdoor country music venue in Friendship, Indiana.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lonnie Mack – April 21, 2016 – Obituary – Tributes.com |url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/print_selections/103505970?type=6 |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=www.tributes.com}}</ref>

In 1977, Mack was shot during an altercation with an off-duty police officer. The experience inspired Mack's tune, "Cincinnati Jail", a rowdy, guitar-and-vocal rock number that he favored in live performances later in his career.

In 1983, Mack relocated to [[Austin, Texas]], for a collaboration with his blues-rock disciple, guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]].<ref>(1) Mack, as quoted in Gettleman, "Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack Is A Low-Key Yet Major Influence On Many Musicians", Orlando Sentinel, as reproduced in Desert News/The Salt Lake Tribune, Tues. PM/Wed. AM, August 3–4, 1993 at p.3. (2) Vaughan idolized Mack, calling him "the baddest guitar player I know" (Vaughan, as heard on DVD entitled "American Caravan: Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble", recorded in 1986
at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis. It can be seen and heard ''here'': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkBqTWBIkKw.) and credited much of his own guitar style to Mack. ("Lonnie invented a lot of this stuff."

Vaughan also said, "I got a lot of the fast things I do from Lonnie" (Menn, Secrets From The Masters, Miller-Freeman, Inc, 1992, p. 278, {{ISBN|0-87930-260-7}}). Three years before his death, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. (Vaughan interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcrkPrxj698). As a teen-ager, Vaughan honed his guitar skills by playing along with ''Wham!'', starting and stopping the record-player repeatedly as he attempted to copy Mack's guitar. (Vaughan interview, https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=GImi3eGVbSI, at counter 17:36; Patoski, "SRV: Caught in the Crossfire", 1993, Backbeat: 15–16.) In his teens, [[Duane Allman]] did the same with ''Memphis''. (Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10 ''et seq''.) Vaughan went on to record ''Wham!'' several times, and called his own instrumental, ''Scuttle-Buttin'', "just another way of playin' [Mack's 1964 instrumental] ''Chicken-Pickin''." (Vaughan, as quoted in review of the album ''Couldn't Stand The Weather'' at http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/stevie-ray-vaughan-couldnt-stand-the-weather-legacy-edition-album-review-265255.

{{blockquote | [In ''Wham!'', Mack] can be heard using the chordal licks of early rock guitar greats, but he infuses his breaks with string bends, pentatonic runs, and mature blues chops, all of which eventually became trademarks of Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield and Stevie Ray Vaughan...A tight chordal riff laid over a fast boogie-woogie rhythm sets the tone for the cut, which contains guitar breaks, vibrato arm highlights, echoey single-note lines, and the repetitive string-pushing licks that eventually became so prevalent in Jeff Beck's guitar style. }}

Mack's early guitar recordings remain closely identified with the dawn of virtuoso blues-rock guitar.<ref name=talkinblues>See, e.g., (1) {{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/talkin-blues-lonnie-mack-and-birth-blues-rock |title=Talkin' Blues: Lonnie Mack and the Birth of Blues-Rock |magazine=[[Guitar World]]|access-date=May 18, 2014}}; (2) Guitar Player, "101 Forgotten Greats and Unsung Heroes", January 2, 2007, at https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/101-forgotten-greats-andamp-unsung-heroes; and (3) Brown & Newquist, ''Legends of Rock Guitar'', "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997 at p.25. (4) They were not his only early demonstrations of soloing skill, however. ''Suzie Q'' (1963) and ''Lonnie on the Move'' (1964) are often mentioned, but the former was not promoted as a single and the latter was lost in the tidal wave of the [[British Invasion]]. A third, ''Chicken-Pickin'' (1964), widely considered Mack's greatest early demonstration of fret-board speed, suffered a similar fate. More recently, Jeff Beck regularly performed ''Lonnie on the Move'' during his 2015 and 2016 tours.  It is a direct copy of Mack's own live, 1990 version. Beck probably first heard the tune when it was issued in Britain on the Stateside label in 1964.

Mack enhanced his guitar sound with [[vibrato]] effects. In his early recordings, he used a 1950s-era [[Magnatone]] amplifier to produce a constant, electronically generated, watery-sounding vibrato,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marcusohara@aol.com |date=2016-04-23 |title=The Unique Guitar Blog: Lonnie Mack – Dead at age 74 – Rock's First Guitar Heroes |url=https://uniqueguitar.blogspot.com/2016/04/lonnie-mack-dead-at-age-74-rocks-first.html |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=The Unique Guitar Blog}}</ref> in the style of R&B guitarist [[Robert Ward (blues musician)|Robert Ward]].<ref name="Davidson" /> Throughout his career, he also used a manually-operated Bigsby [[vibrato arm]] to bend the pitch selectively. He typically cradled the arm in the fourth finger of his picking hand, toggling it while continuing to pick.<ref>Nixon, "It's Star Time!", ''Guitar World'', November 1985 at p. 82.</ref> He often fanned it rapidly to the tempo of his simultaneous [[tremolo picking]], to produce a machine-gunned, single-note, "shuddering" sound.<ref>{{Cite web |title=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/ |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=www.youtube.com |language=en}}</ref> [[Neil Young]] considers Mack a vibrato arm pioneer: "Did I do that first?

While some of Mack's signature performance elements had appeared in early rock saxophone and keyboard solos, a seamless combination of all was essentially unheard in rock guitar before Mack.<ref>(1) "Before Lonnie, the horn guys did all the lead work. He made the guitar the pre-eminent lead instrument". Former Elektra executive James Webber, in Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&q=schaber+mule+train%3B&pg=PA73 See also, Sandmel, Guitar World, May 1984, pp. 55–56. (2) Mack's lead guitar style did not go mainstream overnight. As late as November 1968, a ''Rolling Stone'' reviewer found his use of bluegrass-style runs in his solos "peculiar". Alec Dubro, Review of "The Wham of that Memphis Man!", Rolling Stone, November 23, 1968.</ref> Rock historian Dave Stephens rates Mack's overall guitar sound "highly distinctive, dare I say, unique; in the early rock era only Link Wray and Duane Eddy could match him for instant recognition."<ref name="Davidson" />

== Mack's role in the evolution of rock lead guitar ==

Although notable commercial success was periodic and fleeting, Mack's early-1960s recordings became rock guitar trendsetters. They raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency, helped propel the electric guitar to the top of soloing instruments in rock, and served as prototypes for the genres of blues rock and Southern rock.

Interviewed for a biography of Southern Rock guitar legend [[Duane Allman]], guitarist and early Allman associate Mike Johnstone recalled the professional impact of Mack's rock guitar proficiency when he and Allman were starting out:<ref>Poe, "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story", Backbeat, 2006, at p. 10.</ref>

{{blockquote | Now, [in 1963], there was a popular song on the radio called 'Memphis'—an instrumental by Lonnie Mack. It was the best guitar-playing I'd ever heard. All the guitar-players were [saying] 'How could anyone ever play that good? That's the new bar. That's how good you have to be now.' }}

Another player of that era observed: "Lonnie Mack made the other guitar-slingers of the day – [[Duane Eddy]], [[Dick Dale]], [[the Ventures]] – sound tame by comparison. Only [[Travis Wammack]] and [[Link Wray]] came close."<ref>Windham, "REVIEW: Lonnie Mack made other guitarists in his day sound tame by comparison", Tuscaloosa News, 11/13/2003, preserved on-line at https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/story/news/2003/11/14/review-lonnie-mack-made-other-guitarists-in-his-day-sound-tame-by-comparison/27851967007/</ref>

Mack's "edgy, aggressive, loud, and fast" blues guitar sound is also credited with a key role in the electric guitar's rise to the top of soloing instruments in rock. Blues critic Shawn Hagood wrote:<ref name="auto" />

{{blockquote | His playing was faster, louder, more aggressive than anything people were used to hearing. He essentially paved the way for the electric guitar to become a soloing instrument in rock music. A true blues-rock pioneer, the genre would not have been the same – indeed, much of rock music might not have been the same – without his innovative way of treating the electric guitar as a lead soloing instrument in rock – edgy, aggressive, loud and fast. }}

Former Elektra [[A&R]] executive James Webber agrees:<ref>Greg Schaber, "Mule Train", Cincinnati Magazine, October 2000 issue, pp. 74–83, as preserved at https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&dq=schaber+mule+train&pg=PA73</ref>

{{blockquote | Lonnie took rock guitar playing to a whole different level. You had to really play now. [B]efore Lonnie, the sax guys did all of the lead work. He made the guitar the preeminent lead instrument. }}

Mack's early-1960s guitar tracks are said to have set the stage for blues-rock guitar and Southern rock guitar, styles that first enjoyed broad popularity a few years later. From ''Legends of Rock Guitar'' (1997):<ref>Brown & Newquist, Legends of Rock Guitar, "Lonnie Mack", Hal Leonard Publishing, 1997, p. 24.</ref>

{{blockquote | [Mack] is essentially the missing guitar link between the twangy, multi-string riffing of rockabilly and the bluesy, string-pushing players of the mid-sixties. He also made the crucial bridge between the black blues and white hillbilly music via his lead work...In all, it is not an exaggeration to say that Lonnie Mack was well ahead of his time in 1963. His bluesy solos predated the pioneering blues-rock guitar work of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and Mike Bloomfield by nearly two years. [Since] ''they'' are considered "before their time", the chronological significance of Lonnie Mack for the world of rock guitar is that much more remarkable. }}

Southern rock ([[Allman Brothers]]) lead guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] expressed a similar assessment:<ref name="Warren Haynes">{{cite web|url=http://www.warrenhaynes.net/news/detail/warren_haynes_reflects_on_lonnie_mack|title=Warren Haynes – news|website=Warrenhaynes.net|access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>

{{blockquote | Guitar players, true musicians, and real music fans realize that Lonnie was the Jimi Hendrix of his time. Between the era of Chuck Berry and the era of Hendrix there were a handful of guitar players like Lonnie Mack who were making ground-breaking music that paved the way for the [lead guitar] Revolution. People like Dickey Betts and Stevie Ray Vaughan would tell you that without Lonnie they wouldn't be who they were. That goes for all of us. }}

Mack's 1963 debut album has been called "the first of the ''guitar hero'' records"<ref name="Guterman 1992, p. 34" /> for its introduction of flashy, technically challenging melodies and runs to rock [[guitar solo]]s.

Mack said: "It's a great honor to be able to [inspire other artists]. What you do in this business, your whole thing is givin' stuff away.

== Mack's 1958 Gibson Flying V Guitar, "Number 7" ==
Mack was closely identified with the distinctive-looking [[Gibson Flying V]] guitar that first appeared in 1958. When he was seventeen, he bought the seventh Flying V off the first-year production line, naming it "Number 7".
Mack was viscerally attracted to the arrow-like shape of the guitar.<ref name="gibson.com">McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson on-line, September 5, 2007, at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}</ref> Mack played "Number 7" almost exclusively throughout his career.<ref>McDevitt, "Unsung Guitar Hero Lonnie Mack", Gibson online at http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005828/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Unsung-Guitar-Hero-Lonnie-Mack.aspx |date=April 28, 2016 }}, May 9, 2007.</ref> The title of Mack's final album, ''Attack of the Killer V'', was a reference to his guitar.

Early in his career, Mack added a Bigsby vibrato bar to the guitar. It required mounting a steel crossbeam approximately six inches below the apex of the "V", giving the guitar a unique appearance. Mack favored thick (heavy) strings, i.e., .010, .012, .018w, .028, .038, .052. He typically only bent the first (higher) two, and used a wound string only for the third. He said that the wound third string was important to his sound.<ref>Russ House, Reverb.com, "Celebrity Owned Gibson Flying V" (detailed specifications of No. 7 and its Mack-approved replicas), 2017 (no month or day shown), at https://reverb.com/item/15750071-celebrity-owned-gibson-flying-v-personal-run-for-lonnie-mack</ref>

== "Blue-eyed soul" vocals ==

Throughout his career, Mack's vocals blended white and black Southern roots influences. One commentator dubbed his singing style "country-esque blues".<ref>Watrous, "Lonnie Mack in a Melange of Guitar Styles", New York Times, September 18, 1988. See also, Davis, ''The History of the Blues'', Da Capo Press, 1995, at p. 246, describing Mack's vocals as those of "a white Hoosier with a touch of black Memphis in his soul."</ref> His best-known vocals were gospel-inspired "blue-eyed soul" ballads. Most failed to chart,<ref>(1) "Baby, What's Wrong?" hit the low end of the charts at 93 in December 1963. See, Billboard's "Chart History" list for Mack at http://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719031335/https://www.billboard.com/artist/307816/lonnie-mack/chart |date=July 19, 2018 }}. (2) The blue-eyed soul vocals on Mack's debut album, ''The Wham of that Memphis Man'' (1963) came at a time when the racial divide in American culture was epitomized by the difference between black and white pop music styles. (Kirkus Review of the book, ''Country Soul'', by Charles L. Hughes, U. of North Carolina Press, 2015, at https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-i-hughes/country-soul/). When Mack's first vocal recordings were released in 1963, Mack's gospel-inspired version of the soul ballad "Where There's a Will" was played on R&B radio stations throughout the Deep South. Soon, he was invited to give a live radio interview with a prominent R&B disc jockey in racially polarized Birmingham, Alabama. Mack said that when he appeared at the
radio station, the DJ said, "Baby, you're the wrong color" and canceled the interview on the spot. After that, Mack's vocals received little play on R&B radio stations.

*1983: "Ultimately—for consistency and depth of feeling—the best blue-eyed soul is defined by Lonnie Mack's ballads and virtually everything The Righteous Brothers recorded. Lonnie Mack wailed a soul ballad as gutsily as any black gospel singer.

On April 4, 2009, at age 67, he spontaneously took the stage at a rural Tennessee roadhouse, performing "Cincinnati Jail" with an electric guitar borrowed from the house band's lead player, who wrote:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/lonnie-mack-sat-in-with-my-band-sat-night.532235/|title=Lonnie Mack sat in with my band Sat night...|website=Thegearpage.net|date=April 6, 2009 |access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>

{{blockquote | He made a couple of adjustments and then proceeded to begin OFFICIALLY TEARING THE ROOF OFF THE PLACE. He peeled the paint off the walls with my rig. His (my?) guitar was smoking. Sounded like the breathing of a very large, wild animal. His band leading skills were also awesome. Lots of pointing at people to change dynamics and cue solos. He owned the stage and had everybody doing exactly what he wanted them to do. Crowd went nuts, people were taking pics with their camera phones. People were screaming, everybody started dancing, it was great. He cut my other lead player's head clean off when they were swapping licks, [which] was pretty funny, as [my other lead player] is a big [[Eddie Van Halen]]-style flash player. Bottom line – His playing is still awesome. Tone is very much in the fingers. He made my rig absolutely come alive in ways I've never heard.}}

'''Lynyrd Skynyrd''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɛ|n|ər|d|_|ˈ|s|k|ɪ|n|ər|d}}, {{respell|LEN|ərd|_|SKIN|ərd}})<ref>Pronunciation from album ''[[(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd)]]''</ref> is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] in 1964. The group originally formed as My Backyard and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (vocals), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass), and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums). The band spent five years touring small venues under various names and with several lineup changes before deciding on "Lynyrd Skynyrd" in 1968. The band released its first album, ''[[(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd)]]'', in 1973. By then, they had settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]], and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns left and was replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]] in 1974. King left in 1975 and was replaced by [[Steve Gaines]] in 1976. At the height of their fame in the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]" and "[[Free Bird]]". After releasing five studio albums and one live album, the band's career was abruptly halted on October 20, 1977, when [[Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash|their chartered airplane crashed]], killing Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]], and seriously injuring the rest of the band.

Lynyrd Skynyrd reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, [[Johnny Van Zant]], as lead vocalist. They continued to tour and record with co-founder Rossington, Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996. Over the years, other founding members of the band have died either during—or after—their time in the band.

==History==
===Early years (1963–1973)===
[[Allen Collins]] received his first guitar in 1963 and was later in a band called The Mods in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. The Mods membership included J.R. Rice and Larry Steele. In early 1964, [[Ronnie Van Zant]] joined another local band, The Squires, that he soon renamed to Us. That year, at a local 'Battle of the Bands', Us performed against The Mods and won the competition. Van Zant, however, left Us shortly afterward. In the early summer of 1964, bassist [[Larry Junstrom]], drummer [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]], and guitarist [[Gary Rossington]] formed a trio called Me, You, and Him.{{efn|Rossington was the last to join—at Burns' request.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} }}

Later in the summer of 1964, teenagers Van Zant, Rossington, and Burns all became acquainted while playing on rival baseball teams. The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[The Rolling Stones]]' hit "[[Time Is on My Side]]". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. Bassist Larry Junstrom rounded out the lineup. They soon approached guitarist Allen Collins to join the band just two weeks later, and he agreed to join.{{efn|Collins initially fled on his bicycle and hid in a tree at the sight of Van Zant pulling into his driveway. Collins was soon convinced that Van Zant meant him no harm.<ref name="kijak-documentary" />}}<ref name="kijak-documentary">''If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd''; directed by Stephen Kijak; Passion Pictures; (2018)</ref> The band later rehearsed in Junstrom's carport after Burns' parents said the band was too loud. The band settled on the name My Backyard, later changed to Conquer the Worm for a day or two, then The Noble Five,<ref name=Name_Changes/> and finally The One Percent by 1967.<ref name=Name_Changes>{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com/less2.html |title= History Lessons |publisher= Lynyrd Skynyrd History site (Lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com) |access-date=April 4, 2015}}</ref>

In 1968, Van Zant sought a new name after growing tired of taunts from audiences that the band had "one percent talent". At Burns' suggestion,<ref name="kijak-documentary" /> the group settled on ''Leonard Skinnerd'', which was in part a reference to a character named "Leonard Skinner" in [[Allan Sherman]]'s novelty song "[[Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)|Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh]]"<ref>{{Citation |last =Joseph |first =Hudak |title =Lynyrd Skynyrd's New 'If I Leave Here Tomorrow' Doc: 10 Things We Learned |magazine =Rolling Stone |date =30 May 2018 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/lynyrd-skynyrds-new-if-i-leave-here-tomorrow-doc-10-things-we-learned-630575/ |access-date =18 January 2021}}</ref> and in part a mocking tribute to [[physical education|P.E.]] teacher [[Leonard Skinner]] at [[Robert E.

By 1970, Lynyrd Skynyrd had become a top band in Jacksonville, headlining at some local concerts, and opening for several national acts. Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in Macon, Georgia-based Hustlers Inc.; along with [[Phil Walden]]'s younger brother, [[Alan Walden|Alan]], became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was transferred to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively "southern" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1| title=Oxford Music Online| website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}</ref>

During this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by [[Greg T. Walker]] on bass. At that time, [[Rickey Medlocke]] joined as a second drummer and second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke had grown up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather, [[Shorty Medlocke]], was an influence in the writing of "[[The Ballad of Curtis Loew]]".{{efn|Some versions of the band's history state Burns briefly left the band during this time,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVv-M4Sd46kC&q=bob+burns+suddenly+left+the+band&pg=PT52| title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Remembering the Free Birds of Southern Rock| first1=Gene| last1=Odom| first2=Frank| last2=Dorman| date=October 8, 2002| publisher=Crown/Archetype| via=Google Books| isbn=9780767910286}}</ref> although other versions state that Burns played with the band continuously through 1974.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/arts/music/robert-burns-jr-first-lynyrd-skynyrd-drummer-dies-at-64.html|title=Robert Burns Jr., First Lynyrd Skynyrd Drummer, Dies at 64|first=Ashley|last=Southall|date=April 4, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>}}

===Peak (1973–1977)===
[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd band (1973).jpg|thumb|Lynyrd Skynyrd, 1973]]
In 1972, the band (then comprising Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer [[Al Kooper]] of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio's in Atlanta. Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label, which was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions, playing on only two tracks. He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part that Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in "[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album. After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances.

Lynyrd Skynyrd's fan base continued to grow rapidly in 1973, thanks to their opening on [[the Who]]'s ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' tour in the United States. Their 1974 follow-up album, ''[[Second Helping]]'', featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough. Its single "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]", a response to [[Neil Young]]'s "[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]", reached #8 on the charts that August. Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young wrote the song "[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]" for the band, but they never recorded it.<ref>Simmons, p. 135.</ref> During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but "Sweet Home Alabama" was the only single to crack the top ten.<ref name="Butler, J. Michael 2014"/>

By 1975, personal issues began to take their toll on the band. In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour<ref name="kijak-documentary" /> and was replaced by Kentucky native and former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Artimus Pyle]]. The band's third album, ''[[Nuthin' Fancy]]'', was recorded in 17 days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Dennis |title=Ups and Downs of Lynyrd Skynyrd: More Pop News |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 15, 1975|id={{ProQuest|157771298}}}}</ref> Unhappy with the band's lack of preparation for the album's recording,<ref name="kijak-documentary" /> Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement after the tracking was completed, with Kooper mixing the album while the band left for the tour that had precipitated the constricted recording schedule.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kooper |first1=Al |title=Backstage Passes & Backstabbing Bastards |date=2008 |publisher=Backbeat Books/Hal Leonard Corp. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-87930-922-0 |pages=193–195}}</ref> Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. King's guitar roadie and Van Zant were arrested together and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings that broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to Los Angeles, believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.<ref name="kijak-documentary" />

Collins and Rossington both had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition "[[That Smell]]" – a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the "Prince Charming" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.<ref name="kijak-documentary" />

[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1977]]
The ''[[Street Survivors]]'' album of 1977 turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would "all be in his shadow one day".<ref>{{cite web|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd – L.A. Times|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/lynyrd-sknyrd-l-a-times/|website=The Uncool - The Official Site for Everything Cameron Crowe|access-date=October 17, 2015}}</ref> Gaines' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written "You Got That Right" and the rousing guitar boogie "I Know a Little", which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy "Ain't No Good Life" – the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles "[[What's Your Name (Lynyrd Skynyrd Album)|What's Your Name]]" and "That Smell". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, with shows always highlighted by the iconic rock anthem "Free Bird".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/lynyrd-skynyrd |title=Freebird |publisher=Wolfgangsvault.com |access-date=September 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231906/http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/lynyrd-skynyrd/ |archive-date=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

===Plane crash (1977)===
{{main|Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash}}
Following a performance at the [[Greenville Memorial Auditorium]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], on October 20, 1977, the band boarded a chartered [[Convair CV-240 family#Variants|Convair CV-240]] bound for [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], where they were scheduled to appear at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] the following night. After running out of fuel, the pilots attempted an emergency landing before crashing in a heavily forested area five miles northeast of [[Gillsburg, Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19771020-1&lang=en |title=Accident Report, N55VM (10/20/77) |publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |access-date=September 14, 2011}}</ref><ref name="USNTSB3">{{cite web |date=June 19, 1978 |title=Aircraft Accident Report – L & J Company, Convair 248, N55VM, Gillsburg, Mississippi, October 20, 1977 |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR7806.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200207214020/https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR7806.pdf |archive-date=February 7, 2020 |access-date=March 25, 2014 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |id=NTSB-AAR-78-06}}</ref> Killed on impact were Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, along with backup singer Cassie Gaines (Steve's older sister), assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot John Gray.

The accident came just three days after the release of the group's fifth studio album ''Street Survivors''. Following the crash and the ensuing press, ''Street Survivors'' became the band's second platinum album and reached No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], their highest position on the chart. The single "What's Your Name" reached No.&nbsp;13 on the single charts in 1978. The original cover sleeve for ''Street Survivors'' had featured a photograph of the band amid flames, with Steve Gaines nearly obscured by fire. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with the album's back photo, a similar image of the band against a simple black background.<ref name=Check-Six>{{cite web |title=The 'Lynyrd Skynyrd' Crash |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |work=Check-Six.com |date=May 2007 |access-date=July 5, 2008}}</ref> However, the group would restore the original image for the 30th anniversary deluxe edition of the album.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-02-03 |title=The Lynyrd Skynyrd Album That Created Controversy For Foreseeing The Plane Crash |url=https://rockcelebrities.net/the-lynyrd-skynyrd-album-that-created-controversy-for-foreseeing-the-plane-crash/ |access-date=2022-02-11 |website=Rock Celebrities |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Hiatus (1977–1987)===
Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting only on one occasion to perform an instrumental version of "Free Bird" at [[Charlie Daniels]]' [[Volunteer Jam]] V in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Free Bird - The Charlie Daniels Band & Friends - Jan 13, 1979 |url=https://www.wolfgangs.com/music/the-charlie-daniels-band-and-friends/audio/20052270-3738179.html?tid=4797426 |language=en |access-date=2022-02-11}}</ref>

Rossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed the [[Rossington Collins Band]],<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=302}}</ref> which released two MCA albums, ''Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere'' in 1980 and ''This Is The Way'' in 1981. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, Dale Krantz, as the lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgement of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of "Free Bird". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married<ref>{{cite news |last=Lovejoy |first=Heather |url= http://www.jacksonville.com/news/metro/2011-10-21/story/lynyrd-skynyrd-honkette-dale-krantz-rossington-tlcs-say-yes-dress |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Honkette Dale Krantz-Rossington on TLC's 'Say Yes to the Dress' |newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |date=October 21, 2011 |access-date=August 15, 2021}}</ref> and with whom he formed [[The Rossington Band]], which released two albums, ''Returned to the Scene of the Crime'' in 1986 and ''Love Your Man'' in 1988 and also opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987–1988.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker [[Mylon LeFevre]]. During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed the Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes [[JoJo Billingsley]] and [[Leslie Hawkins]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennesseeconcerts.com/Skynyrd.html |title=Exclusive Lynyrd Skynyrd Plane Crash Pictures |last=Adams |first=Pat |website=tennesseeconcerts.com |access-date=February 7, 2018 |archive-date=February 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207122910/http://www.tennesseeconcerts.com/Skynyrd.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> and released one MCA album, titled ''A.P.B.''

In 1980, Allen Collins's wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while [[Miscarriage|miscarrying]] their third child. He formed the [[Allen Collins Band]] in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington Collins Band and released one MCA studio album, ''Here, There & Back''. He was visibly suffering from Kathy's death; he excessively drank and consumed drugs. On January 29, 1986, Collins, then 33, crashed his [[Ford Thunderbird]] into a ditch near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend Debra Jean Watts and leaving himself permanently paralyzed from the chest down.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apnews.com/60be797135c45eefa4c334ecc2679ca7 |title=Woman Killed, Rock Musician Injured In One-Car Accident| publisher=Associated Press| date=January 30, 1986| access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Ult"/>

===Return (1987–1995)===
In 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, [[Johnny Van Zant|Johnny]], took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins' paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. In return for avoiding prison following his guilty plea to DUI manslaughter, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of "[[That Smell]]", the lyrics of which had been partially directed at him).{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} Collins was stricken with [[pneumonia]] in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990, at age 37.<ref name="Ult">Giles, Jeff.

The reunited band was intended to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album ''[[Southern by the Grace of God]]: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987''. That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not "exploit" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness |newspaper=[[Florida Trend]] |accessdate= }}</ref> Following this rule, the band would have been forced to retire in 2001, but they have still continued to tour for another two decades.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

The band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''. By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band's sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled ''[[The Last Rebel]]'' in 1993. Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sutori |url=https://www.sutori.com/en/story/lynyrd-skynyrd-the-history--6Y6To7gaAvxtW3MsJ9j6KjRY |access-date=2023-05-24 |website=www.sutori.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1994, Owen Hale replaced Kurt Custer on drums.

===Member changes and deaths (1996–2019)===
Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996 due to heart complications that required a transplant. In his absence, he was replaced by [[Hughie Thomasson]]. The band did not let King rejoin after he recovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NXdfW9kpokC&pg=PA142|title=SPIN|first=SPIN Media|last=LLC|date=April 1, 1999|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|via=Google Books}}</ref> At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by [[Rickey Medlocke]], who had previously played and recorded with the band for a short time in the early 1970s. The result was a major retooling of the band's 'guitar army'. Medlocke and Thomasson would also become major contributors to the band's songwriting along with Rossington and Van Zant.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The first album with this new lineup, released in 1997, was entitled [[Twenty (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|''Twenty'']]. The band released another album, ''[[Edge of Forever]]'' in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer [[Kenny Aronoff]]. [[Michael Cartellone]] became the band's permanent drummer on the subsequent tour. Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that the band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The band released a Christmas album, entitled ''[[Christmas Time Again]]'' in 2000. [[Leon Wilkeson]], Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to [[emphysema]] and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by [[Ean Evans]].<ref name=Evans_death/>

The first album to feature Evans was [[Vicious Cycle (album)|''Vicious Cycle'']], released in 2003. This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song "Red, White and Blue". The band also released a double album called ''[[Thyrty: The 30th Anniversary Collection|Thyrty]]'', which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour. On June 22, 2004, the album ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Thomasson left the band in 2005 to reform [[Outlaws (band)|The Outlaws]], and [[Mark Matejka|Mark "Sparky" Matejka]], formerly of the country music band [[Hot Apple Pie]], joined in 2006 as his replacement. 

On March 13, 2006, Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (also discussed later in the article), and they reunited with former members Bob Burns (drums), Artimus Pyle (drums), and Ed King (guitar) for a performance of "Free Bird."<ref name="R&RHOF reunion at induction">{{cite magazine |last1=Greene |first1=Andy |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Reunions That Actually Happened |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/32-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-reunions-that-actually-happened-11011/1-simon-garfunkel-1990-229501/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=March 1, 2024 |date=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

On November 2, 2007, the band performed for a crowd of 50,000 people at the University of Florida's [[Gator Growl]] student-run [[pep rally]] in [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] ("The Swamp" football stadium).

In November 2023, [[Dolly Parton]] released a cover of "Free Bird" on her rock album [[Rockstar (Dolly Parton album)|Rockstar]]; this version also featured contributions from members of Lynyrd Skynyrd (including slide guitar from Rossington, recorded before his death), along with former drummer Artimus Pyle and his band, and even part of the late Ronnie van Zant's vocal track from the original recording of "Free Bird" (with the permission of Ronnie van Zant's widow).  A similar version was featured on a Pyle-led tribute album of re-recorded collaborations with other musicians on Skynyrd songs, and Skynyrd also plans (as of 2023) to release their own similar version; however, according to Parton, only her version was allowed to use Ronnie van Zant's original vocal track.<ref name="Free Bird re-recordings in 2023 with Dolly Parton and Artimus Pyle">{{cite web |last1=Classic Rock |title="Ronnie Van Zant's widow wouldn't allow Lynyrd Skynyrd to use his voice, but she said: 'I'll do it for Dolly'": how Dolly Parton ended up covering Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird on her new album |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/dolly-parton-lynyrd-skynyrd-free-bird-cover |website=LouderSound.com |publisher=Classic Rock Magazine |access-date=March 1, 2024 |date=November 12, 2023}}</ref>

'''Montgomery Gentry''' were an American [[country music]] duo founded by singers Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry, both [[Kentucky]] natives. They began performing together in the 1990s as part of two different bands with Montgomery's brother, [[John Michael Montgomery]]. Although Gentry won a talent contest in 1994, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery after Gentry was unable to find a solo record deal, and Montgomery Gentry was formed in 1999. The duo is known for its [[Southern rock]] influences, and has collaborated with [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Toby Keith]], [[Five for Fighting]], and members of [[The Allman Brothers Band]].

Montgomery Gentry released six studio albums for [[Columbia Records]]' Nashville division: ''[[Tattoos & Scars]]'' (1999), ''[[Carrying On]]'' (2001), ''[[My Town (album)|My Town]]'' (2002), ''[[You Do Your Thing]]'' (2004), ''[[Some People Change]]'' (2006), and ''[[Back When I Knew It All]]'' (2008), and a Greatest Hits package. These albums produced more than twenty chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including the {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 hits, "[[If You Ever Stop Loving Me]]", "[[Something to Be Proud Of]]", "[[Lucky Man (Montgomery Gentry song)|Lucky Man]]", "[[Back When I Knew It All (song)|Back When I Knew It All]]", and "[[Roll with Me]]". Ten more of their songs reached the Top 10 on the country chart, including the {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 3 hit, "[[Gone (Montgomery Gentry song)|Gone]]", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. ''Tattoos & Scars'', ''My Town'', and ''You Do Your Thing'' are all [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist—Country at the [[American Music Awards]]. Both the [[Academy of Country Music]] and [[Country Music Association]] named them Duo of the Year in 2000, awards for which they were nominated by one or both associations in every year until 2012.

==Musical styles==
Montgomery Gentry's sound was defined by [[Southern rock]] influences. Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that the duo "evokes the sound and spirit of Southern rockers like [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], the [[Marshall Tucker Band]], and Charlie Daniels, painting themselves as rowdy redneck rebels who still hold small-town values."<ref name="allmusic"/> They cite Daniels, Lynyrd Skynyrd and [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] as primary musical influences.<ref name="cmtgray">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443581/montgomery-gentry-carrying-on-with-macho-country.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213110824/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1443581/montgomery-gentry-carrying-on-with-macho-country.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 13, 2016|title=Montgomery Gentry 'Carrying On' With Macho Country|last=Gray|first=Michael|date=May 4, 2001|work=CMT|access-date=September 16, 2011}}</ref> Montgomery and Gentry alternated as lead vocalists, with Gentry often accompanying on [[acoustic guitar]].<ref name="mlive"/> Jurek wrote that "Montgomery's rough hewn baritone and Gentry's almost unreal range and trademark phrasing make something highly original".<ref name="tattoos"/> In his book ''Country'', Richard Carlin describes Montgomery Gentry as "rock[ing] harder than [[Brooks & Dunn]], although their music could be seen as an extension of that successful pair's boot-scootin' sound." He also wrote that Gentry sings with a "sweet, high tenor" while Montgomery "complements with an earthy, sometimes raspy, baritone", and notes that the duo has an "energetic stage show and dress".<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlin|first=Richard|title=Country|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=142}}</ref>

Many of the duo's mid-tempo songs, such as "My Town", centralized on a theme of rural lifestyles.<ref name="my town"/> Others, such as "You Do Your Thing"<ref name="ydyt amg"/> and "Some People Change", contained messages of tolerance towards others with differing opinions.<ref name="edmonton"/>

==History==
The band was formed in 1998 by Barry Abernathy, [[Steve Gulley]] (vocals, guitar), [[Adam Steffey]] (mandolin), and [[Jim Van Cleve|Jim VanCleve]]. Johnny Dowdle was introduced early as the band's original bassist. For a short period, Adam Steffey left the band to play with bluegrass/gospel group [[The Isaacs]], during which Steffey was replaced by Alan Perdue. Early in 2000, Dowdle left the group and was replaced by Jason Moore, the former bassist for the James King Band. In 2001, Steffey returned to the group, and Mountain Heart added virtuoso guitarist, Clay Jones,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mountain-tradition-mw0000346426 |title=Mountain Tradition - Clay Jones &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2005-06-28 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> in 2003.

Mountain Heart performed in Scarborough, Ontario as part of the Bluegrass Sundays Winter Concert Series in 2000 and 2001.<ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, February 2000</ref><ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, April 2001</ref> In 2005, they took part in the Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival.<ref>"Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival", ''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, October 2005</ref> Later, in 2007, the band revisited Canada when they played the [[Tottenham Bluegrass Festival]] in Ontario.<ref>''Strings'', newsletter of the Pineridge Bluegrass Folklore Society, June 2007</ref>

The band released their first, eponymous project in 1999, on [[Doobie Shea Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1434148/doobie-shea-records-shutters |title=Doobie Shea Records Shutters |publisher=Billboard |date=2004-07-06 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> following it quickly with an all-gospel release, ''The Journey''.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://ibmaawards.org/node/42#gospe |title=Recipient History &#124; IBMA Awards |accessdate=February 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225135634/http://ibmaawards.org/node/42 |archivedate=February 25, 2013 }}</ref> In 2001, the band signed with Skaggs Family Records and soon released ''No Other Way'', their first for the label.<ref>{{cite web|author=Erik Hage |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/no-other-way-mw0000662137 |title=No Other Way - Mountain Heart &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2002-09-17 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}</ref> The project was nominated for Album of the Year by the IBMA, with Mountain Heart being nominated for Entertainer of the Year.

'''Mudcrutch''' was an American musical group from [[Gainesville, Florida]], whose sound touched on [[Southern rock|southern rock]] and [[country rock]]. They were first active in the 1970s and reformed in 2007, and are best known for being the band which launched [[Tom Petty]] to fame.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mudcrutch-mw0000783357 | title=Mudcrutch - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/2-mw0002938002 | title=2 - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref>

Mudcrutch formed in Gainesville in 1970 and soon became a popular act across Florida. The band moved to Los Angeles in 1974 to attract the attention of a record company. Though they signed a contract with [[Shelter Records]], they released only one poor-selling single before breaking up in 1975. The following year, former Mudcrutch members Petty, [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], and [[Benmont Tench]] formed the core of a new band, the Heartbreakers.

Most of the original Mudcrutch lineup reformed in 2007 to record their first album as a group, which was followed by a tour. A second album followed in 2016. Petty's death in 2017 effectively dissolved the group; Leadon died in 2023.

== History ==
=== 1970–1975 ===
Mudcrutch was formed in 1970 by [[Gainesville, Florida]], residents [[Tom Petty]] and [[Tom Leadon]] (brother of [[Bernie Leadon]] from [[The Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]), then teenagers, who had been playing together in a group called the Epics. Mudcrutch's lineup consisted of Petty (bass and vocals), Leadon (guitar and vocals), Jim Lenahan (vocals), Randall Marsh (drums) and [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] (guitar). Lenahan was initially the band's lead vocalist, but Petty very quickly also started singing lead on some songs.  

This incarnation of Mudcrutch issued a locally distributed single ("Up In Mississippi"/"Cause Is Understood") in 1971, with Petty writing and singing both songs. Leadon and Lenehan left the band in 1972 and were replaced by bassist/guitarist/vocalist Danny Roberts and keyboardist [[Benmont Tench]]. Ricky Rucker was a part of the band for a short time. Mudcrutch became locally popular and regularly played gigs from central Florida to southern Georgia. In Gainesville, they had a long stint as the house band at Dub's Lounge and organized several well-attended music festivals at "Mudcrutch Farm", a run-down house on a large lot where several band members lived.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Reinink|url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20080608/whats-left-of-the-mudcrutch-farm |title=What's left of the Mudcrutch Farm?  |website=Gainesville.com |access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref>
[[File:Campbell autograph.jpg|left|thumb|"Depot Street" [[gramophone record|vinyl]], signed by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]]]]
In 1974, the members of Mudcrutch decided to relocate to [[Los Angeles]] to try to sign with a major record label. After several rejections, they signed with [[Leon Russell]]'s independent [[Shelter Records]]. The band released one single, "Depot Street" in 1975, which failed to chart. After Danny Roberts left the group, Petty invited [[Charlie Souza]] to take over on bass guitar and the band continued recording in Leon Russell's [[The Church Studio|Tulsa studio]], and later at his [[Encino, California]], home. Discouraged by the group's lack of success, the record company broke up Mudcrutch in late 1975, keeping only Petty under contract. Several months later, Petty regrouped with former Mudcrutch members Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench to form [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|the Heartbreakers]] along with fellow Gainesville natives [[Stan Lynch]] (drums) and [[Ron Blair]] (bass).<ref>DeYoung, Bill. "Tom Petty: Full Steam Ahead" ''Goldmine'' July 13, 1990: 18–30</ref>

=== Reformation: 2007–2017 ===
In August 2007, Tom Petty invited Randall Marsh and Tom Leadon, original members of Mudcrutch, to reunite with Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell to reform Mudcrutch. They recorded an album, ''[[Mudcrutch (album)|Mudcrutch]]'', which was released on April 29, 2008, by [[Reprise Records]], and contains 14 old and new tracks. "We would play and then we would just talk about the old days," said Leadon. The band toured briefly in California to promote the album throughout April and the beginning of May 2008. The album hit number 8 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/311924/mudcrutch/chart |title=Mudcrutch – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref>

Fans who bought tickets to the tour through [[Ticketmaster]] were given six free downloads from the album.

On November 11, 2008, a live EP titled ''[[Extended Play Live]]'' was released. All tracks were recorded live in April 2008. On the same day American music channel [[VH1 Classic]] broadcast a documentary about the band.

According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mudcrutch intended to reconvene August 2015 to begin work on a new album. The group was originally going to begin work on the album in January of that year, but things were pushed back eight months due to medical issues that rhythm guitarist Tom Leadon was experiencing.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Tom Petty's Pre-Fame Band Mudcrutch to Record New Album|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-pettys-pre-fame-band-mudcrutch-to-record-new-lp-20150602|magazine = Rolling Stone|access-date = October 9, 2015}}</ref> In February 2016, prior to the announcement that they were releasing a second album, Mudcrutch was announced as a headliner for both the 2016 Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the 2016 Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, Illinois.

The band's second full-length album, ''2'', was released May 20, 2016, on Reprise Records. Preceding the album's release was a single, "Trailer", as well as "Beautiful World" and "Hungry No More". The album hit number 10 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name="billboard1" /> Less than three days after the album was released, the band embarked on their first national tour in support of the album. The tour began the same way their 2008 tour did: with two benefit shows for the Midnight Mission (on May 23 and 24, 2016, in Los Angeles). [[Herb Pedersen]], who is also credited on ''2'', joined Mudcrutch on the tour.

Petty died on October 2, 2017, of [[cardiac arrest]], while Leadon died on March 22, 2023, of natural causes.<ref>[https://wbsm.com/ixp/295/p/tom-leadon-dead/ Tom Leadon, Mudcrutch Co-Founder, Dead at 70]</ref> Both deaths effectively ended the possibility of any further Mudcrutch activity.

'''Palomino Road''' was an American [[country music]] group composed of Ronnie Guilbeau ([[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]]), [[J. T. Corenflos]] ([[guitar]]), James Lewis ([[Drum kit|drums]]) and Randy Frazier ([[bass guitar]]). Founded in 1992, the band recorded a self-titled album for [[Liberty Records]], and charted with a cover of [[George Jones]]'s 1955 debut single "[[Why Baby Why]]".

==History==
All four members of Palomino Road had experience in country music prior to the band's foundation. Lead singer Ronnie Guilbeau (son of [[Gib Guilbeau]] of [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]])<ref name="whitburn"/> had played in that band before a 1980s move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. J.T. Corenflos, the band's guitarist, was previously a backing musician for [[Joe Stampley]], while Randy Frazier had previously backed [[Sammy Kershaw]] and James Lewis had been active as a drummer in Nashville since the 1970s.

Palomino Road signed to [[Liberty Records]] in 1992, releasing its self-titled debut album in early 1993. This record featured no contributions from external musicians. Its first single, a cover of [[George Jones]]'s 1955 single "[[Why Baby Why]]", reached number 46 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. The album's second single, "The Best That You Can Do", was released in 1993 but failed to chart. The band broke up later that same year.

In 1994, Frazier joined the band [[McBride & the Ride]] as bass guitarist.<ref name="new">{{cite journal |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |date=March 1994 |title=McBride & the Ride: Now They Are Six |journal=New Country |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=11}}</ref> The lineup with Frazier disbanded in 1996. Corenflos, meanwhile, found work as a session guitarist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://specials.tribstar.com/nashville/corenflos/ |title=Man behind the music: Session guitarist J.T.

==Biography==
Thorn was raised in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]].{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} Before his professional music career began, he was a professional boxer, where he established a respectable 14–4 record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I-S8pmpMjc|title=Episode #3: Paul Thorn - Former Pro Boxer and Musician|access-date=May 10, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Boxing career highlights include winning the Mid-South Middleweight Championship in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and culminated with a nationally televised bout with former world champion [[Roberto Durán]],<ref name="GAC1" /> After a few years of working in a Tupelo furniture factory and playing in local clubs, he was discovered by music professional [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]] (brother of [[The Police (band)|The Police]] drummer [[Stewart Copeland]]).

In 1997, while performing at a singer-songwriters night at a local pizza shop (Vanelli's), Roger Sovine, representing [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], overheard Thorn and was impressed with his singing and songwriting ability. He asked Thorn if he had his permission to share his name with other record companies in Nashville. A couple weeks later, Thorn called vOz Vanelli (owner of Vanelli's) and mentioned that several record companies were coming to Tupelo to hear him perform. Thorn asked if he could come and play at Vanelli's which vOz agreed to. After hearing Thorn perform, Wyatt Easterling (an associate of [[Miles Copeland III]]) brought Thorn to Nashville and within thirty days, Thorn opened for [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. Thorn was subsequently signed to a recording contract with [[A&M Records]] and recorded his first album, ''Hammer & Nail,'' in 1997. He left A&M soon after and followed ''Hammer & Nail'' with thirteen more albums, all self-released and self-produced with his writing and production partner, Billy Maddox.

'''Randy Yeuell Owen''' (born December 13, 1949) is an American [[country music|country]] musician. He is best known for his role as the lead singer of [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], a [[country rock]] band that saw tremendous mainstream success throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Alabama became the most successful band in country music, releasing over 20 gold and platinum records, dozens of number 1 singles, and selling over 75&nbsp;million records during their career. Owen also maintains a career as a solo performer. He released his solo debut ''[[One on One (Randy Owen album)|One on One]]'' in late 2008 and charted two singles from it.

Owen was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2019.

== Biography ==
Randy Yeuell Owen grew up on a farm near Fort Payne, Alabama. He is of [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]] ancestry. He dropped out of high school in the ninth grade, but he returned and graduated from Fort Payne High in 1969.
In the late 1960s, Owen and his cousin, Teddy Gentry, began playing music together. They recruited another cousin, Jeff Cook, to form a band, which they called Wildcountry. Their first public performance was at a high school talent show, which they won.

Owen's music career was put on hiatus as he earned an English degree from [[Jacksonville State University]]. He was also a member of [[Pi Kappa Phi]], Delta Epsilon Chapter. Upon his graduation, however, the three cousins moved into an apartment in [[Anniston, Alabama]], and by 1973 were pursuing a full-time music career. In 1980, the band, now called [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], were signed to a recording contract by RCA Records and quickly reached country superstardom. For the next twenty-two years, Alabama had a tremendous impact on [[country music]], attracting a younger group of listeners, crossing over into pop radio, and paving the way for groups to be successful on country radio.

Alabama released 21 gold, platinum, and multi-platinum albums, 42 singles that topped the charts at #1, and sold over 75 million records in total.  They have a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and were named the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Artist of the Decade in 1989, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s Country Group of the Century in 1999.

In May 2002, the band announced their retirement during the [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards telecast.  For the rest of 2002 and 2003, they performed throughout the country in their American Farewell Tour.  In 2005, the band was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

Owen lives on his cattle ranch outside Fort Payne. He currently serves as an at-large member of the Board of Trustees of [[Jacksonville State University]]. In 2007, he was a judge on Season 5 of the country talent show ''[[Nashville Star]]''.

Owen took over hosting duties for ''Country Gold'', the Saturday night [[classic country]] request program on [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]], beginning July 21, 2012. The show was reformatted upon Owen's arrival, switching to a pre-recorded format (the show's predecessor, ''Country Gold Saturday Night'', was originally live; requests are handled, as they had been with Owen's immediate predecessor, by an [[answering machine]]) [[voice-tracking|voicetracked]] from Owen's home, drifting to a more open-ended "traditional country" format (one that includes more 1990s songs and even some 2000s songs along with country-pop tunes more commonly associated with the [[classic hits]] format while moving away from the core songs of the classic country format) and shortening the show from five hours to four. (In protest of the change of format, previous ''Country Gold'' host Rowdy Yates relaunched his version of the show as "The Original Country Gold" through [[Compass Media Networks]] a year later.) Owen ended his run as host on April 2, 2016, with [[Terri Clark]] replacing him the following weekend.

'''Waylon Albright''' "'''Shooter'''" '''Jennings''' (born May 19, 1979) is an American musician and record producer. He is the son of [[Country music|country]] singers [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Jessi Colter]]. In a career spanning three decades, Jennings has explored a variety of musical genres.

Jennings made his debut with the single "4th of July" of his 2005 album ''[[Put the "O" Back in Country]]'' on [[Universal South Records|Universal South]], which peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard country charts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Shooter Jennings - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/279176/shooter-jennings/chart?f=320|website = www.billboard.com|access-date = November 21, 2015}}</ref> Jennings has since followed with seven full-length studio albums: ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' (2006), ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' (2007), ''[[Black Ribbons]]'' (2009), ''Family Man'' (2012), ''The Other Life'' (2013) ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'' (2016), and ''Shooter'' (2018), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous [[Extended play|EPs]].

== Early life ==
Jennings was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname "Shooter." His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. "I love my mom," says Jennings, "but I like Dad's version better. And I believe it's true. He didn't make [stuff] like that up."

He lived the first few years of his life in a crib on his parents' tour bus surrounded by the likes of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. By age 5, he was playing drums. At 8 years old, he began taking piano lessons. He started playing guitar at 14 and on occasion he'd play percussion in his father's band.

In high school Jennings fronted an industrial rock band called KilRaven for his high school's talent show. In 2011, he released the KilRaven track "Only You" on the album "Missed The Boat".

In 1996, Jennings and his father recorded an album together. They called it ''Fenixon'' (a play on the words "phoenix" and "son") but could not find a label to distribute it.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Waylon and Son, Reunited on Disc|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471459623460261|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = November 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Jim|last = Fusilli}}</ref> Some of the material was remastered and used for the album ''Waylon Forever''. The full ''Fenixon'' recording was finally released by Jennings' label Black Country Rock in 2014. Shooter Jennings is the uncle of William Harness, Professionally known as [[Struggle Jennings]].

== Career ==
[[File:Shooterjennings(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|Jennings performing in 2009]]

=== Stargunn ===
In 2001, Jennings left [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to seek his fortunes in [[Los Angeles]]. He assembled and performed with Stargunn, a [[rock music|rock]] band. The band featured Jennings on piano and lead vocals, Carter Falco, and Jonathan Boddie (later succeeded by Kevin Sciou) on guitar and background vocals, Curtis Roach on bass, and Lex Lipsitz on drums. Towards the end of 2001, Stargunn released their first album, ''The Only Way Up Is Down'', and toured with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], Mark Ford and others in support of the album. That same year, ''[[Music Connection]]'' magazine listed Stargunn as one of the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists of 2001.

In 2002, Stargunn was featured on ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', and the soundtrack to the [[Vince Vaughn]] film ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] licensed the song "White Lines N Black Ties" for the film ''[[The Crew (2000 film)|The Crew]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stargunn performed together for three years, built an avid following, and earned praise from the local music press. On March 30, 2003, Jennings dissolved Stargunn and began working on his solo career.

After the band's breakup, Jennings was twice presented with the opportunity to front the hard rock supergroup [[Velvet Revolver]], but chose instead to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SHOOTER JENNINGS Claims He Was Offered VELVET REVOLVER Job Twice|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shooter-jennings-claims-he-was-offered-velvet-revolver-job-twice/|website = BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date = March 19, 2009|access-date = November 21, 2015|language = en-US}}</ref>

In 2015, Jennings' label Black Country Rock released Stargunn's debut album "The Only Way Up Is Down" on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.

=== ''Put the "O" Back in Country'' ===
He returned to Los Angeles in 2004 to begin working on new material. In 2005 Jennings signed his first recording contract, with [[Universal South Records]], releasing his debut album ''[[Put the "O" Back in Country]]'' that same year.

"Put the "O" Back in Country" produced his only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in its lead-off single "Fourth of July", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22. The album version of this song features a cameo appearance by George Jones, who sings the chorus to his signature song "He Stopped Loving Her Today" at the end; this guest appearance was removed from the song's radio edit. Despite the edit, Jones was credited on the Billboard charts. The album featured his new band The .357's, which consisted of Leroy Powell on guitar, Bryan Keeling on drums, [[Ted Russell Kamp|Ted Kamp]] on bass with [[Robby Turner]] on steel, and backing vocals by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].

Later that year his song "Busted In Baylor County" was then featured in the 2005 film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', furthermore Jennings portrayed his father in the [[Johnny Cash]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Walk the Line]]'' alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]. His rendition of his father's song "Long Way From Home" was featured on the film's soundtrack.

=== ''Electric Rodeo'' and ''The Wolf'' ===
Though recorded before ''Put the "O" Back in Country'', released on April 4, 2006,{{clarify|reason=is this the release date of Put the O Back in Country or the release date of Electric Rodeo?|date=April 2017}} ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' was released as Jennings's second solo album. Sonically, ''Electric Rodeo'' is louder, rawer, more upfront rock and roll than its predecessor.

''Electric Rodeo'' was followed by ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' on October 23, 2007. The album varied from his previous records in that the .357s had opted for a decidedly 1970s feel to the instrumentals. It featured collaborations with [[Doug Kershaw]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], as well as a cover of the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Walk of Life]]".

That same year Jennings was featured on a duet of "[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]" on [[Deana Carter]]'s sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''.

=== Departure from Universal ===
In 2009, Jennings, having issues with his label and wanting out of his four-album contract released his first compilation album, ''[[Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's]]''. The album featured four new tracks; live versions of "Lonesome Blues", and "Daddy's Farm", as well as covers of his father's "Lonesome, Onry and Mean", and the [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] song "Living Proof".

After the release of ''Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's'', having fulfilled his four-album contract; Jennings parted ways with Universal records.

On March 23, 2009, Jennings took part in ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', a television show in which two musicians are paired with one another and perform a small concert together for an intimate crowd. The episode paired Jennings with close friend and fellow musician [[Jamey Johnson]]. The evening's set list consisted entirely of duets, including a cover of "[[Outlaw country|Outlaw]] Shit" from the ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' album, two songs from Jennings' discography; "God Bless Alabama", "It Ain't Easy". As well as four songs from Johnson's album ''[[That Lonesome Song]]''; "High Cost Of Living", "Mowing Down The Roses", "Between Jennings and Jones" and "In Color".

=== ''Black Ribbons'' ===
Having left Universal, Jennings changed the name of his backing band from The .357's to Hierophant. With the news that he and his band would be joining the likes of [[Paramore]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Jefree Star]], and various other popular rock bands on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]] it became apparent that Jennings next album would differ drastically from his previous efforts.

In February 2009, it was announced that the album would be titled ''[[Black Ribbons]]''. It was also announced that it would be a dystopian concept rock opera and that writer [[Stephen King]] would play a major role in the album as Will O' The Wisp.

It was released independently on March 2, 2010, through Black Country Rock Records, and although it was seen as a complete departure from his country sound, the album showed off the diversity as an artist and gained him much critical acclaim, as well as a brand new underground following.

On May 1, 2010, Jennings announced "Black Ribbons: The Living Album" on his Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShooterJennings |title=Shooter Jennings (ShooterJennings) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=June 3, 2014 |access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref> The "Living Album" includes the full studio record and live shows with [[Hierophant]] on a [[USB flash drive]] shaped like a tarot card.
Towards the end of 2010, Jennings with the help of various other artists launched the "XXX" movement to help musicians who struggle to receive mainstream recognition.

In 2016, Jennings created and released a podcast series title "Beyond the Black" dealing with the topics and recording of [[Black Ribbons]]. The series is available on all music streaming formats as well as YouTube and the podcast's own website: [http://www.beyondthe.black www.beyondthe.black]

=== ''Family Man'' ===
In 2011, along with childhood friend and master pianist Erik Deutsch, Jennings formed The Triple Crown, a new backing band featuring Erik Deutsch on piano, Tony Leone on drums, Jeff Hill on bass, Jon Graboff on pedal steel, Eleanor Whitmore on fiddle and Chris Masterson on lead guitar.

On March 13, 2012, having signed a record deal with [[E1 Music]], and with The Triple Crown along for the ride, Jennings returned to his country roots with the release of the album ''Family Man'', his first self-produced outing. The album was originally meant to contain eighteen tracks, but was instead split into two albums: ''Family Man'' and 2013's ''The Other Life''.

On July 31, 2012, Jennings was featured in [[Bucky Covington]]'s debut single "The Drinking Side of Country" from the album ''Good Guys''.

Jennings took part in the February 25 Johnny Cash 80th Birthday Bash, in which he sang [[Cocaine Blues]] With [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Amy Nelson]]. The performance was released in a DVD/CD combo.

In October 2012 Jennings was one of six commentators for the Ovation mini-series ''Song By Song: Johnny Cash''.

=== ''The Other Life'' ===
While recording ''Family Man'', Jennings decided to cut the darker tracks from the album, and instead use them for the album's follow-up, ''The Other Life''.

"Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing ''Family Man'', and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records. ''The Other Life'' is representative of the other side of the coin from ''Family Man'' and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways, At first we were going to call it ''The Outsider'', but once we got into the film we thought, 'Well, it's like a mirror, a dark mirror of what ''Family Man'' was.{{'"}} - Jennings told TheBoot.com.

Jennings premiered the track "Wild & Lonesome" (featuring [[Patti Griffin]]) on the 4th season of the FX original series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Followed by the release of first official single from the album "The White Trash Song" (featuring [[Scott H. Biram]]) which premiered on RollingStones.com along with the announcement that the album would be accompanied by a film.

The album featured seven new songs, as well as two cover songs ([[Harry Nilsson]]'s "Flying Saucer song" and [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s "The White Trash song") and "Outlaw You", which was put out in early 2012 as a digital release.

Jennings along with filmmaker Blake Judd released ''The Other Life'' film. Running at 32 minutes long, it utilizes six of the songs from the album as a sort of narration. The film is about a musician leaving his family to tour, but when he does so he finds the road is not the same, and becomes haunted by a mysterious woman. Throughout the film, the musician is forced to face his darker urges and deal with self-discovery, temptation, isolation and rebirth. The film closes with a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.

The Other Life went on to win Best Short Film at the 2013 Horror Hound Festival.

The album was also heavily featured in the 2nd season of ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', of which Shooter also appears, as himself.

=== Black Country Rock Media ===
{{main|Black Country Rock Media}}
In October 2013, Jennings announced the formation of his new label and multi-format recording company, Black Country Rock. Their initial releases included: a remastered release of the [[Waylon Jennings]] album ''[[Right for the Time]]'', two live albums (one from [[Jessi Colter]] titled ''Live from Cain's Ballroom'', and one from Jennings titled ''The Other Live''), as well as a recording of "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" featuring vocals from both [[Jamey Johnson]] and Jennings. All four were released on vinyl, cassette, CD, as well as digitally.

=== ''The Magic'' ===
On February 27, 2014, Jennings revealed he would be releasing a spoken word follow-up to Hierophant's 2010 album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]'', titled ''The Magic'', inspired by first story in the controversially interactive horror series thirteen.

In addition to ''The Magic'' Jennings also announced, that after nearly a decade of waiting, he would be releasing the 1995 collaborative album, ''Fenixon''.

Both projects were released during 2014's Record Store Day, and subsequently sold out.

=== "George/Giorgio" releases ===
Towards the end of May 2014, Jennings announced his intention to release two EP's later in the year. ''Don't Wait Up (for George)'' is a tribute to his close friend and mentor [[George Jones]], which was released in August 2014. Jennings' seventh studio album, ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'', was originally scheduled to be released in November 2014, but its release was delayed due to the sudden death of [[Jon Hensley (radio personality)|Jon Hensley]], Jennings' longtime manager and friend and Black Country Rock co-founder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-daft-punk-and-the-muppets-inspired-shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-6616503 |title=How Daft Punk and the Muppets Inspired Shooter Jennings' Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album |first=Daniel |last=Kohn |work=[[LA Weekly]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |date=February 23, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> A tribute to 1970s electronic-music pioneer and producer, [[Giorgio Moroder]], the album was released on February 26, 2016, and features guest vocals from [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6882805/shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-countach-david-bowie-interview |title=Shooter Jennings on Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album & How His David Bowie Cover 'Ended Up Meaning So Much More' |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 19, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Brandi Carlile]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/shooter-jennings-enlists-marilyn-manson-brandi-carlile-for-countach-20160104 |title=Shooter Jennings Enlists Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile for 'Countach' |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 4, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/02/marilyn-manson-covers-the-hell-out-of-david-bowies-cat-people-listen/ |title=Marilyn Manson covers the hell out of David Bowie's "Cat People" — listen |first=Ben |last=Kaye |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=February 18, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[Richard Garriott|Richard Garriott de Cayeux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/neon-noir-meets-outlaw-country-shooter-jennings-tr-230314 |title=Neon noir meets outlaw country in Shooter Jennings' tribute to Giorgio Moroder |first=Mike |last=Vanderbilt |work=[[The A.V.

=== ''Shooter'' ===

Following Countach, [[Brandi Carlile]] insisted that Jennings be involved in her next project. Together with [[Dave Cobb]], Jennings produced her 2018 album ''[[By the Way, I Forgive You]]'', which landed six Grammy nominations, including the all-genre Album and Song of the Year categories. It won in three categories: Americana album and both best American roots song and best American roots performance (for "The Joke").

After reuniting with Dave Cobb, with whom Jennings made his first four records, Jennings, inspired by the 1984 country album ''[[Major Moves]]'' decided to shelve the album he had already been working on and instead go in a completely different direction with Cobb and make a fun, straight-ahead drinking, rockin' record. That album, titled ''Shooter'', was released in August 2018. 
 
The following year Jennings teamed up with Brandi Carlile to produce [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 25th album, ''[[While I'm Livin']]''. The record, Tucker's first in 17 years, earned Grammys for Best Country Album and Best Country Song as well as Americana Award nominations for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Artist of the Year.

=== ''Over a Cocaine Rainbow'' ===

In late 2021 Jennings released "Leave Those Memories Alone", a tribute to his late friend and manager, Col. John Hensley. the track serves as the first single from the album ''Over a Cocaine Rainbow''. The record was initially slated for a 2017 release, but Jennings felt it was too "dark and experimental" to release at the time, given its subject matter and tone. Earlier that same year, Jennings released a remix of his "From Here to Eternity" track. The new version is dubbed the "Goof the Floof Remix", a reference to something Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] once said in an interview.

=== Radio show ===

'''The Departed''' (also known as '''Cody Canada and the Departed''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band. The band was formed in 2011 by [[Cody Canada]], the former lead vocalist and guitarist for [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] after that band broke up in 2010. The band currently consists of Canada (guitars and lead vocals), Jeremy Plato (bass guitar and vocals), and [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] (drums).

==Formation==
After Oklahoma based southern rock band [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] broke up in 2010, [[Cody Canada]] decided to start the Departed that was billed by Texas and Oklahoma music scene observers as a "Super Group." Canada remained on lead vocals and lead guitar and former Ragweed bass guitar player Jeremy Plato joined Canada. Canada recruited friend and Texas based blues rock singer and songwriter Seth James to be co-lead on guitar and vocals, well known red dirt keyboardist Steve Littleton, and fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma]] native Dave Bowen on drums. Naming themselves "The Departed" as all had left previous bands to join together, the group at first billed themselves as "Cody Canada and The Departed" namely for fan recognition according to the band members in a 2011 interview.

==''This Is Indian Land''==
The band released its first album in June 2011 titled ''This Is Indian Land'' through its own record label, Underground Sound. The record was a tribute album to Oklahoma music and songwriters. The band's cover version of the Red Dirt Rangers song "Staring Down the Sun" was the only released single from the album. Two other songs, "The Ballad of Rosalie" and "Skyline Radio" both charted on the Texas and Oklahoma music charts.

==''Adventūs''==
On August 24, 2012, now billed as simply The Departed, the band announced on its website and in social media that it would release its first original album, ''Adventūs'' (Latin for "arrival") on November 13, 2012, on Underground Sound. Bowen had left the group and was replaced by Chris Doege on the drums. The band moved to an [[alternative rock]] and grunge sound with driving electric guitars and the power vocals of James and Canada. Three singles were released: "Worth The Fight", "Prayer For the Lonely" and "Flagpole".

==''HippieLovePunk'' & Line-Up Changes==
In September 2013, Seth James announced that he intended to leave the band. The parting was amicable; as James said. "After three years of great times and great music, I have decided to take a step down as a band member of the Departed. It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/cody-canada-announces-the-departed-lineup-changes-new-solo-acoustic-live-album-due-this-fall/article/3883601 |title=Cody Canada announces The Departed lineup changes, new solo acoustic live album due this fall |author= Brandy McDonnell |date= September 16, 2013 |work=NewsOK }}</ref> The band continued performing as a four-piece group.

In 2014, the band finished a new album, ''HippieLovePunk''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/5-minutes-in-texas-with-cody-canada-20140721 |title=5 Minutes in Texas With Cody Canada|author= Jim Casey |date=July 21, 2014 |magazine= Rolling Stone }}</ref> It was released on January 13, 2015, and debuted at No. 9 on the Top [[Alternative Country]] Albums chart, with 4,700 copies sold in the US in its first week. The sound was, for the most part, still like the alt-rock sound of ''Adventūs''.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://roughstock.com/news/2015/01/32254-country-album-chart-report-january-21-2015/|title=Country Album Chart Report For January 21, 2015 |author= Matt Bjorke |date=January 21, 2015 |work=Roughstock }}</ref> Cody Canada and The Departed, as the band was once again known, debuted a new line-up at The MusicFest in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on January 8, 2015. [[East Texas]] native Ross Smith replaced Littleton on keyboards and took up rhythm guitars, while [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] became the drummer in place of Doege. In late November 2015, the band produced a music video for the song "All Nighter" on ''HippieLovePunk'' at John T. Floore's Country Store in [[Helotes, Texas]]. The song and the video were dedicated to the former bass guitar player for [[Micky and the Motorcars]] Mark McCoy, who had died in [[Idaho]] in 2012 while on vacation. The songs "Inbetweener" and "Easy" were released as singles.

==''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect''==
In early 2016, the band announced on social media that it would be releasing an album consisting of cover versions of classic country songs. This project was named ''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect'', honoring 1960s era country music with songs by [[Johnny Paycheck]], Stonewall Jackson and [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]], among others. The bass guitarist, Plato, took the lead vocals and had Canada, Smith and Hansen as his backing on the project. [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly's]] Cody Braun and Cody Angel of Jason Boland and the Stragglers contributed their instrumentation to the project, as well as the folk singer Jamie Lin Wilson, who sang backing vocals and also appeared on a popular duet with Plato.

==''3''==
In early 2017, Ross Smith left the band and The Departed became a 3 piece set with Canada, Plato, and Hansen. On April 20, 2018 the band released the single "Lipstick" from their new album ''3'', that was released on June 29, 2018, by the Underground Sound Label. [[Mike McClure]], who had produced several of Cross Canadian Ragweed's albums, came back to produce the album. The name of the album comes from the number of those who were left in the band. It was also their 3rd album of original content as '''In Retrospect''', and '''Indian Land''' had both been cover albums.

==Current==
Due to the band's current lineup, several popular Cross Canadian Ragweed songs have made their way back into the Departed's nightly set list in addition to the new material the band has written. Canada said in a 2018 Rolling Stone interview that he was "truly happy with the way the band is now and I feel this is the band I have always wanted, and really deserved."

'''The Kentucky Headhunters''' are an American [[country rock]] and [[Southern rock]] band originating in the state of [[Kentucky]]. The band's members are Doug Phelps (bass guitar, vocals), Greg Martin (lead guitar, vocals), and brothers Richard Young (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Fred Young (drums, vocals). It was founded in 1968 as Itchy Brother, which consisted of the Young brothers and Martin, along with Anthony Kenney on bass guitar and vocals. Itchy Brother performed until 1982, with James Harrison replacing Martin from 1973 to 1976. The Youngs and Martin began performing as The Kentucky Headhunters in 1986, adding brothers Ricky Lee Phelps (lead vocals, harmonica) and Doug Phelps (bass guitar, vocals) to the membership.

With the release of its 1989 debut album ''[[Pickin' on Nashville]]'' via [[Mercury Records]], the band charted four consecutive Top 40 country singles. A second album for Mercury, ''[[Electric Barnyard]]'', did not do as well commercially, and the Phelps brothers left after its release to form [[Brother Phelps]]. Kenney re-joined and Mark S. Orr took over on lead vocals for 1993's ''[[Rave On!! (album)|Rave On!!]]'' and a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[The Best of The Kentucky Headhunters: Still Pickin']]'' before the band exited Mercury. Orr left and Doug Phelps rejoined in 1996 as lead vocalist for the album ''[[Stompin' Grounds]]''. He also led on the [[Audium Entertainment]] albums ''[[Songs from the Grass String Ranch]]'' and ''[[Soul (The Kentucky Headhunters album)|Soul]]'', as well as ''[[Big Boss Man (The Kentucky Headhunters album)|Big Boss Man]]'' and a second compilation, ''[[Flying Under the Radar]]'', on CBuJ Entertainment. After Kenney's departure, Doug once again became the band's bass guitarist by the release of ''[[Dixie Lullabies]]'', in 2011.

The Kentucky Headhunters has released ten studio albums, three compilations, and twenty-three singles. Its highest-peaking single is a cover of the [[Don Gibson]] song "[[Oh Lonesome Me]],"  which the band took to number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in 1990. In addition, the band has won three [[Country Music Association]] awards, an [[Academy of Country Music]] award, and a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], won in 1990 for ''Pickin' on Nashville''.

==History==

===1968–1982: Early years as Itchy Brother===
Richard Young, his younger brother Fred, and their cousins Anthony Kenney and Greg Martin began performing music in the Youngs' and Kenney's hometown of [[Glasgow, Kentucky]], in the 1960s. They founded a band called Itchy Brother,<ref name="violets">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/1258|title=Kentucky Headhunters no shrinking violets|last=Morrison|first=Tonya Parker|date=2005-07-19|work=American Chronicle|access-date=2009-05-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815005533/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/1258|archive-date=2009-08-15}}</ref> named after Fred's favorite cartoon character,<ref name="indie"/> from ''[[King Leonardo and His Short Subjects]]''. The original lineup consisted of Richard Young on [[rhythm guitar]], Fred Young on drums, Kenney on bass guitar, and Martin on lead guitar. Itchy Brother achieved regional success in Kentucky in the 1970s, including at least one single, "Shotgun Effie," which they wrote about the Youngs' grandmother, Effie.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Mark|title=Dixie Lullaby|page=215|isbn=0-8203-2872-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdMX9tbWdEMC&q=%22Shotgun+effie&pg=PA215|date=September 2006|publisher=University of Georgia Press }}</ref> It was released in 1973 on the King Fargo label. That same year, Greg Martin left the group to play in another band in his hometown of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. In the meantime, guitarist James Harrison took his place. Martin returned to the group in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bgdailynews.com/amplifier/music/our-musical-memories-the-rocking-sound-of-itchy-brother-an-interview-with-james-harrison-and/article_40892156-6893-5d0c-815d-c199d50301a7.html|title=Our Musical Memories: the rocking sound of Itchy Brother, an interview with James Harrison and Greg Martin|first=Jack|last=Montgomery|website=Bowling Green Daily News|date=24 March 2009 }}</ref>

Itchy Brother was almost signed to [[Swan Song Records]], an independent label founded by the band [[Led Zeppelin]], in 1980. The label closed after Led Zeppelin drummer [[John Bonham]] died, and Itchy Brother never recorded a full album on Swan Song.<ref name="oldies">{{cite web | title=The Kentucky Headhunters biography | url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/The-Kentucky-Headhunters.html | work=Oldies.com | access-date=2009-05-23 }}</ref> Itchy Brother broke up in 1982. After their disbanding, Richard started writing songs for [[Acuff-Rose Music]], and Fred became a backing musician for country singer [[Sylvia (singer)|Sylvia]], who at the time was recording on [[RCA Records]]. Martin played [[bass guitar]] and sang backing vocals for [[Ronnie McDowell]], then a recording artist for [[Curb Records]], and Kenney stopped performing, although he continued to write songs with the Young brothers.<ref name="violets"/>

===1986–1988: Reunion with new name===
When Martin attempted to reunite Itchy Brother in 1985, the Young brothers joined him, but Kenney declined. Martin invited [[Missouri Bootheel]] native Doug Phelps,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|date=1991-06-17|title=Mixing Hard Rock with Country Music Puts Five Down-Home Boys on a Roll|volume=35|issue=23|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20115340,00.html|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> also a member of McDowell's band, to replace Kenney, and Doug brought his older brother Ricky Lee to sing lead vocals.<ref name="allmusic"/> The band decided to name themselves The Headhunters, taking the name from the term "headchopper," which blues musician [[Muddy Waters]] used to indicate that he had supplanted another band in a gig.

===1989–1990: Debut album and early success===
The Kentucky Headhunters borrowed $4,500<ref name="kentucky">{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Charles|title=Kentucky Country|page=181|isbn=0-8131-0879-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3x4TUwtiCZgC&q=%22kentucky+headhunters%22&pg=RA1-PA180|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Kentucky }}</ref> to record a [[demo (music)|demo]] album, which included seven original songs, plus covers of [[Bill Monroe]]'s "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine," [[Henson Cargill]]'s "[[Skip a Rope]]", and [[Don Gibson]]'s "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]."<ref name="kentucky"/> Originally intended to be sold at the band's live shows, the demo tape came to the attention of the Nashville music community.<ref name="oldies"/> Although Martin said that the band had not seriously considered signing a record deal, the band pursued one through the suggestion of its manager, Mitchell Fox.<ref name="asker"/> [[Harold Shedd]], a record producer who was then the head of [[Mercury Records]], helped sign The Kentucky Headhunters to the label in 1989.

Mercury released the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters' debut album, ''[[Pickin' on Nashville]]''. The album produced four singles, all of which reached top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart. The first of these, the "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine" cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|page=223|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> After it came "[[Dumas Walker]]."  According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: "[The label] thought it was too regional, and that no one outside the area would get it, but what they didn't see, was the reaction we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn't matter where we were playing either."<ref name="doug">{{cite web|url=http://www.libertynjustice.net/gettoknow_doug.php |title=Get to know Doug Phelps |work=Liberty 'n Justice |access-date=2009-05-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522222722/http://www.libertynjustice.net/gettoknow_doug.php |archive-date=2009-05-22 }}</ref> The single peaked at number 15 on the ''Billboard'' chart.<ref name="whitburn"/>

Following "Dumas Walker" was "Oh Lonesome Me", which peaked at number eight; this was the band's only Top Ten hit. Finishing off the single releases was the number 23 "Rock 'n' Roll Angel",<ref name="whitburn"/> which Richard wrote. ''Pickin' on Nashville'' also earned the band a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], Best New Vocal Group award from the [[Academy of Country Music]] (ACM), and Album of the Year and Vocal Group of the Year awards from the [[Country Music Association]] (CMA).<ref name="CMA">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaawards.com/2008/database/ArtistDetail.aspx?artistId=1527|title=Artist Detail for The Kentucky Headhunters|work=Academy of Country Music|access-date=2009-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VP&p_theme=vp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAFF2F4F4A3F7AE&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Headhunters' excitement captures fans|last=Roberts|first=Frank|date=4 May 1990|work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|pages=B5|access-date=13 March 2010}}</ref> In addition, it earned a double-platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipping two million copies in the United States.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Kentucky%20Headhunters&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA search results for The Kentucky Headhunters|work=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=2009-05-26}}</ref> William Ruhlmann of [[Allmusic]] gave the album a four-and-a-half star rating out of five, saying that the band was "all the better" for having a sound closer to rock than country.<ref name="pickinreview"/> After the success of their debut album, The Kentucky Headhunters began touring with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] and [[Delbert McClinton]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Om0WAAAAIBAJ&pg=4617,6911895&dq=kentucky-headhunters|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714005950/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Om0WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2hIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4617,6911895&dq=kentucky-headhunters|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-14|title=Kentucky Headhunters explode|last=Tianen|first=Dave|date=1990-07-27|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|access-date=2009-05-26}}</ref>

===1991–1992: Second album and departure of the Phelps brothers===
In 1991, the band released their second album, ''[[Electric Barnyard]]''.

This album was met with mixed reception from critics. [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it an A rating, saying that it "skillfully blends raw wit, the working-class energy of sweat-stained factory workers jamming between shifts, and musical styles as diverse as the corny [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] and the creamy [[Eric Clapton]]."<ref name="ewelectric"/> Allmusic critic [[Brian Mansfield]], who gave it three-and-a-half stars, called the band a "top-notch Southern rock band with a sense of humor," and said that the covers on ''Electric Barnyard'' were highlights, while the originals were "adequate, offbeat filler."<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r123509|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Electric Barnyard'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|work=Allmusic|access-date=2009-07-15}}</ref> Randy Lewis of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the band "[[ZZ Top]] lite" and said that most of the songs on the album had a "party-hearty sound."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61197495.html?dids=61197495:61197495&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+14%2C+1991&author=RANDY+LEWIS&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=**+KENTUCKY+HEADHUNTERS+%22Electric+Barnyard%22+Mercury&pqatl=google|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021143549/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61197495.html?dids=61197495:61197495&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+14,+1991&author=RANDY+LEWIS&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=**+KENTUCKY+HEADHUNTERS+%22Electric+Barnyard%22+Mercury&pqatl=google|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 21, 2012|title=''Electric Barnyard'' review|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=1991-04-14|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=65|access-date=2009-07-15}}</ref>

Ricky Lee and Doug departed in June 1992 due to creative differences.

===1992–1994: New line-up and lack of success===
Kenney rejoined in 1992 as bass guitarist, and [[Charlotte, Michigan]], native Mark S.

Mansfield gave a two-star rating for Allmusic, where he wrote that the band had "devolved into a [[redneck]] [[boogie]] group."<ref name="rave"/> Nash's review for ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave it a C− grade, and called it "warmed-over blues" that lacked the "outrageousness, wit, and brilliance that distinguished their earlier albums."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1993/03/26/rave|title=''Rave On!'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=1993-03-26|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2009-07-15}}</ref> Steve Morse of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called it an "irresistible car-stereo album,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADE046D6A69415&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=''Rave On!!'' review|last=Morse|first=Steve|date=1993-02-25|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=2009-07-15}}</ref> and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic John Swenson said that the album was more rock-oriented than its predecessors, also saying that it "sounds like a hell of a blueprint for a summer concert tour."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/warrenhaynes/albums/album/161776/review/5944391/tales_of_ordinary_madness|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814193359/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/warrenhaynes/albums/album/161776/review/5944391/tales_of_ordinary_madness|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 14, 2009|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Kentucky Headhunters, Warren Haynes reviews|last=Swenson|first=John|date=1993-05-27|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=2009-07-15}}</ref>

''[[Songs from the Grass String Ranch]]'', the band's next album, was completed almost 18 months before its release.

It included the non-charting single "Lonely Nights" and a tribute song to Carl Perkins entitled "Last Night I Met Carl Perkins", as well as two covers: "I Still Wanna Be Your Man," originally recorded by [[Eddie Hinton]], and "[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman?]]," a [[blues]] standard made famous by [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name="aboutsoul">{{cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blsoulrev.htm|title=''Soul'' review|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|work=[[About.com]]|access-date=2009-06-24|archive-date=2009-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820015220/http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blsoulrev.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> This album received generally favorable reviews.

'''The Marshall Tucker Band''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. Noted for incorporating [[blues]], [[country music|country]] and [[jazz]] into an eclectic sound, the Marshall Tucker Band helped establish the [[Southern rock]] genre in the early 1970s.<ref name=larkin /> While the band had reached the height of its commercial success by the end of the decade, it has recorded and performed continuously under various line-ups for 50 years.<ref name=larkin>Colin Larkin (ed.), "Marshall Tucker Band". ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Vol. 5 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 521–522.</ref> Lead vocalist [[Doug Gray]] remains the only original member still active with the band.

The original line-up of the Marshall Tucker Band, formed in 1972, included [[lead guitarist]], vocalist and primary songwriter [[Toy Caldwell]] (1947–1993), lead vocalist [[Doug Gray]] (born 1948), keyboard player, saxophone player and [[flautist]] [[Jerry Eubanks]] (born 1950), rhythm guitarist [[George McCorkle]] (1946–2007), drummer Paul Riddle (born 1953) and bassist [[Tommy Caldwell (musician)|Tommy Caldwell]] (1949–1980). They signed with [[Capricorn Records]] and released their first album in 1973, ''[[The Marshall Tucker Band (album)|The Marshall Tucker Band]]''.

After Tommy Caldwell was killed in a car accident in 1980, he was replaced by bassist Franklin Wilkie. Most of the original band members had left by 1984.<ref name=olson>Ted Olson, "Marshall Tucker Band."

==Origin of the name==
The "Marshall Tucker" in the band's name does not refer to a band member, rather to a blind piano tuner from Spartanburg.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blind piano tuner turns talent into a key business|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19830215&id=8dZOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6972,3967212&hl=en|access-date = 2016-01-13|date = February 15, 1983|publisher = Associated Press|last = Herring|first = Melissa}}</ref>  While the band was discussing possible band names one evening in an old warehouse they had rented for rehearsal space, someone noticed that the warehouse's door key had the name "Marshall Tucker" inscribed on it, and suggested they call themselves "The Marshall Tucker Band," not realizing it referred to an actual person. Later it came to light that Marshall Tucker, the piano tuner, had tuned a piano in that rented space before the band and his name was inscribed on the key.<ref name=bio>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090529001722/http://marshalltucker.com/nt-31-biography.html The Marshall Tucker Band – Biography]. 2009.

==History==
===Early history===
The original members (and some later members) of the Marshall Tucker Band had been playing in various line-ups under different band names around the Spartanburg area since the early 1960s. In 1966 members of several such bands merged to form the Toy Factory, named after guitarist Toy Caldwell. The Toy Factory's constantly shifting line-up included, at various times, Caldwell, his younger brother Tommy, Doug Gray, Jerry Eubanks, George McCorkle and Franklin Wilkie. In the late 1960s, four of the band members served in the US military;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgemccorkle.com/Bio.htm|title=GEORGE MCCORKLE|publisher=georgemccorkle.com|access-date=3 June 2012|archive-date=14 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814042449/http://www.georgemccorkle.com/Bio.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|title=Marshall Tucker Band to Entertain Troops in Iraq & Kuwait|author=Ryan|date=May 4, 2011|publisher=marshalltucker.com|access-date=3 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611130837/http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|archive-date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|title=Marines salute Hutchings, Caldwells|author=Dudley Brown|date=June 29, 2003|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|access-date=3 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611130837/http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|archive-date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Toy Caldwell served in the Marine Corps and received a Purple Heart after being wounded in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/arts/toy-caldwell-jr-45-a-founder-of-the-marshall-tucker-band.html|title=Toy Caldwell Jr., 45, a Founder of the Marshall Tucker Band|date=February 26, 1993|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref>

By the 1970s, Toy Caldwell and George McCorkle had returned to Spartanburg and the Toy Factory had resumed playing in area clubs.<ref name=smith>Michael B. Smith, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/toy_bio.htm Toy Caldwell's Carolina Dreams]. Tuckerhead.com.  Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref>

In 1972 Caldwell and McCorkle once again revamped the band's line-up, eventually settling on Tommy Caldwell on bass, George McCorkle rhythm guitar, vocalist Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks, keyboards/flute/tenor sax, while adding Paul Riddle on drums; the new line-up adopted the name "Marshall Tucker Band". [[Wet Willie]] lead singer [[Jimmy Hall]] told Toy Caldwell to book the band at Grant's Lounge in [[Macon, Georgia]], which he did. After hearing the band play at Grant's Lounge, Buddy Thornton and [[Paul Hornsby]] recorded the band's [[demo (music)|demo]] at [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn Studios]]. [[Frank Fenter]] and [[Phil Walden]] signed the Marshall Tucker Band to [[Capricorn Records]] based on those demos.

===1970s===
The Marshall Tucker Band's [[The Marshall Tucker Band (album)|self-titled debut]], produced by [[Paul Hornsby]], was released in 1973 and certified gold in 1975.<ref name=elliott>James Elliott, "Marshall Tucker Band." ''Definitive Country: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Country Music and its Performers'' (New York: Berkley Publishing Group, 1995), pp. 504-505.</ref> All of the tracks were written by Toy Caldwell, including "[[Can't You See (The Marshall Tucker Band song)|Can't You See]]" which was released as a popular single in 1973 and re-released in 1977, generating much FM airplay and becoming the group's best known song. After the album's release, the band began touring, playing upwards of 300 shows per year throughout the decade.<ref name=elliott /> Southern rock fiddler [[Charlie Daniels]] later recalled that the Marshall Tucker Band "came onstage and just blew it out from start to finish."<ref name=alfonso>Barry Alfonso, Notes to ''The Marshall Tucker Band: Anthology'' [CD liner notes]. Ramblin' Records, 2005.</ref> 

Daniels' first of many collaborations with the Marshall Tucker Band came on the band's second album, ''[[A New Life (album)|A New Life]]'',<ref name=alfonso /> which was released in 1974, and certified gold in 1977.<ref name=elliott /> Daniels and blues guitarist [[Elvin Bishop]] were among several musicians that joined the band for ''[[Where We All Belong]]'',<ref name=alfonso /> a double-album (one studio album and one live album) released by the band in 1974 and certified gold that same year.

The following year the band's ''[[Searchin' for a Rainbow]]'' was also certified gold the year of its release, and contained the track "[[Fire on the Mountain (The Marshall Tucker Band song)|Fire on the Mountain]]," which peaked at No. 38 on the [[Billboard charts]]. ''[[Long Hard Ride]]'', the band's fifth consecutive gold album, was released in 1976,<ref name=alfonso /> and its instrumental title track (which again features Charlie Daniels on fiddle) was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]].<ref name=cortner>Amy Cortner, "Marshall Tucker Band." ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006). p. 1186.</ref>

''[[Carolina Dreams]]'', released in 1977 and certified platinum that same year, proved to be the band's most commercially successful album, and included the track "[[Heard It in a Love Song]]", which reached No. 14 on the Billboard charts.<ref name=elliott />  And the band's final Capricorn release came with 1978's ''[[Together Forever (The Marshall Tucker Band album)|Together Forever]]'', which was produced by [[Stewart Levine]].<ref name=alfonso />

Following the bankruptcy of Capricorn, the Marshall Tucker Band moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1979 for their ninth album, ''[[Running Like the Wind]]'' (the band's eighth release was a compilation album entitled ''Greatest Hits''), and they retained Levine as the album's producer.

In August 1979, the band played at [[Knebworth Festival 1979|Knebworth Festival]] in England. [[Led Zeppelin]] was the headline act at both of their festival appearances.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} Official Website Knebworth Festival - August 11, 1979|url=https://www.ledzeppelin.com/|access-date=2022-01-09|website=Led Zeppelin {{!}} Official Website - Official Website|language=en}}</ref>

===1980s===
On April 22, 1980, following the completion of the band's tenth album ''[[Tenth (The Marshall Tucker Band album)|Tenth]]'', bassist and co-founder Tommy Caldwell suffered massive head trauma in a car wreck and died six days later. Former Toy Factory bassist Franklin Wilkie replaced Caldwell for their next album, [[Dedicated (The Marshall Tucker Band album)|''Dedicated'']] (1981), but the band was never able to recapture its commercial success of the 1970s.

On 1982's ''Tuckerized'', which featured Ronnie Godfrey, who joined them as an additional keyboardist, only two songs were written by band members; "Sea, Dreams & Fairy Tales" by Toy Caldwell and "Sweet Elaine" by George McCorkle. And main songwriter Toy Caldwell only contributed three songs to each of their next two albums, both released in 1983; ''Just Us'' and ''Greetings from South Carolina''. Afterwards, all the rest of the original band members split in June 1984, except for Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks.<ref name=larkin />

During the summer of 1984, MTB toured with a revamped lineup featuring Gray, Eubanks, Spartanburg guitarist Rusty Milner and new Nashville players: Bob Wray (bass), [[James Stroud]] (drums), Kenny Mims (guitar) and [[Bobby Ogdin]] (keyboards).  But in 1985, Wray, Stroud and Mims were replaced respectively by session veteran [[Tom Robb]] (from [[Leslie West]]'s Wild West Show), Stuart Swanlund (guitars, slide guitar, pedal steel guitar, vocals) and  David "Ace" Allen (drums).

In 1988 Gray and Eubanks released the album ''Still Holdin' On'', their one and only release on the Mercury Records label, which had been recorded mostly back in 1985 in Nashville with the 84/85 mostly Nashville players lineup. 

Bassist Tim Lawter joined in 1987, and the newer members (including newly added, in 1989, keyboardist Don Cameron) had a much greater role on the band's 1990 album, ''Southern Spirit'', released on the Sisapa label. The album marked a return to the band's country and blues roots.<ref name=tuckerhead>Tuckerhead.com, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/still_holdin_on_review.htm ''Still Holdin' On'' Review]. 2002–2008. Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref>

===1990s===
In 1992 the Marshall Tucker Band produced its first album for the Cabin Fever label, ''Still Smokin'''. Just after the album's recording, drummer David "Frankie" Toler (ex-[[Allman Brothers Band]]) replaced Allen on drums and Mark Pettey replaced Don Cameron later that same year on keyboards.

The band's 1993 release, ''Walk Outside the Lines'', marked a transition to a more country sound, relying less on long improvised jams that were the trademark of the band's early career.<ref>Craig Cumberland, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/walk_review.htm ''Walk Outside the Lines'' Review]. Tuckerhead.com,  Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref> The album's title track was co-written by country music star [[Garth Brooks]], a long-time fan of the band who considered writing a track for them a "milestone" in his career.<ref name=elliott />

The band added Spartanburg-area guitarist Ronald Radford in 1993 to 1995 after Swanlund suffered a hand injury, and Radford appeared on 1998's ''Face Down In the Blues'', along with [[Firefall]]'s multi-instrumentalist David Muse, the latter replacing Jerry Eubanks who had retired in 1996. But Swanlund was back in the band from 1995 till his death in 2012 and Muse was there from 1996-2000, then again in 2003-2009.

Garry Guzzardo replaced drummer Toler in 1994-1996 and was succeeded by current drummer B.B. Borden (ex-[[Mother's Finest]]) in 1997, guitarist Chris Hicks joined in 1996, after a long stint in the [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]], and keyboardist Paul Thompson (who came in after Pettey left) was briefly a member in 1994, but was dropped pretty soon after and not replaced. He was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1998.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1998 - 1999|website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com}}</ref>

''Gospel'', the band's 1999 album, featured the band's rendition of traditional songs including [[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|"The Wayfaring Stranger"]], [[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|"Will the Circle Be Unbroken"]], and several original tracks.

===21st century===
[[Clay Cook]] (saxophone, flute, keyboards, vocals) was a member from 2000-2009 and Dave Muse returned in 2003-2009 before 
being succeeded by current man Marcus James Henderson in 2009. Longtime bassist Tim Lawter was succeeded by Tony Heatherly in 2001, who turned it over to Pat Elwood in 2004. Guitarist Rusty Milner left in 2003 and Stuart Swanland was there on and off (his health permitting) from 1985 until his death on August 5, 2012 at age 54. The current guitarists are Chris Hicks (since 1996) and Rick Willis (since 2009) and bassist Tony Black was there from 2017-2019. Ryan Ware has occupied the bass chair since the band returned to the road in 2021, after the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].   

The Marshall Tucker Band continued recording and performing into the 21st century, playing between 150 and 200 shows per year.<ref name=bio /> The band reissued many of its albums from the 1970s on its new Ramblin' Records label, as well as two two-disc compilations, the first (''Anthology'') being a 30-year retrospective and the second (''Where a Country Boy Belongs'') being a collection of the band's country songs. In 2004, they released another studio album, ''Beyond the Horizon'', and the following year released a Christmas album, ''Carolina Christmas''. In 2007 they released their newest studio album ''The Next Adventure''.

"Can't You See'" was used for the opening and closing credits of the [[Kevin Costner]] 2008 motion picture ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]''. "Take the Highway" was also used in the movie.

"Can't You See" is also used in the 2001 film ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'' and the 2017 film ''[[I, Tonya]]''.

==Musical style==
[[Tommy Caldwell (musician)|Tommy Caldwell]] described the Marshall Tucker Band's music as [[progressive country]], explaining that the band played [[country music]] structures and riffs combined with [[jazz]] improvisation upon which more complex structures were built from the country music foundation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/marshall-tucker-band-where-we-all-belong-album-of-the-week-club-review |title=Marshall Tucker Band: Where We All Belong - Album Of The Week Club review|author=Staff |date=January 24, 2022 |work=Classic Rock |access-date=2023-07-22}}</ref> In 1977, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' identified the Marshall Tucker Band as major performers of the genre.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p00EAAAAMBAJ&dq=marshall+tucker+band+%22progressive+country%22&pg=PT92 |title=Traditional Country + Modern Sound |last=Cech |first=Tom |date= October 15, 1977|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2023-07-24}}</ref> Aside from progressive country, the band has also been categorized as [[Southern rock]],<ref name=longislander>{{Cite web|url=http://www.longislandernews.com/life-and-style/the-marshall-tucker-band-brings-southern-rock-to-the-paramount|title=The Marshall Tucker Band Brings Southern Rock To The Paramount|website=Long Islander News|date=6 December 2017 |access-date=Apr 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name=allmusic3/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/the-marshall-tucker-band-southern-jam-kings-32507|title=The Marshall Tucker Band: Southern jam kings|website=Axs.com|access-date=Apr 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/op-ed-marshall-tucker-band-puts-on-the-best-southern-rock-show-of-2017/article/510984|title=Op-Ed: Marshall Tucker Band puts on the best southern rock show of 2017|date=December 28, 2017|website=Digitaljournal.com|access-date=Apr 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beneathadesertsky.com/2017/10/15/the-marshall-tucker-band-brings-its-southern-rock-to-talking-stick-resort-showroom/|title=The Marshall Tucker Band Brings its Southern Rock to Talking Stick Resort Showroom |website=Beneathadesertsky.com|first=Fred|last=Kuhlman|date=15 October 2017 |access-date=Apr 28, 2019}}</ref> [[blues rock]],<ref name=allmusic4>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-on-long-island-4-18-80-mw0000445891|title=Live on Long Island: 4-18-80 - The Marshall Tucker Band &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=Apr 28, 2019}}</ref> [[country rock]],<ref name=Faignant/> [[jazz rock]],<ref name=Faignant>{{cite web |url= https://www.rutlandherald.com/features/vermont_arts/the-marshall-tucker-band-southern-rock-n-roll-music-with-the-ability-to-stray/article_c0af42cc-74ac-5792-956d-1134f912c4d5.html |title=The Marshall Tucker Band: 'Southern rock 'n' roll music with the ability to stray' |last=Faignant |first=Janelle |date=February 18, 2023 |work=Rutland Herald |access-date=2023-07-22}}</ref> and as a "proto-[[jam band]]".<ref name=allmusic4/> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts have categorized the band as country, blues and [[adult contemporary]].<ref name=allmusic3/>

Remembering the early years in 2012,  Doug Gray describes the band as being like <nowiki>''a bowl of soup like your mom would cook. Whatever was in the refrigerator was all thrown in there, and however it tasted was what it was.'' As Grey remarks, the result was so eclectic that the press didn'</nowiki>t really know what to make of them as they failed to fit neatly in any pigeonhole.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Goldmine Staff|title=MTB's singer Doug Gray is still searchin' For a rainbow|url=https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/mtbs-singer-doug-gray-is-still-searchin-for-a-rainbow|access-date=2020-12-17|website=Goldmine Magazine: Record Collector & Music Memorabilia|date=15 July 2012 |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
The Steel Woods were cofounded by Wes Bayliss and Jason "Rowdy" Cope. Cope was the creative lead of the band as well as its [[lead guitar]]ist, songwriter and co-producer, while Bayliss is a multi-instrumentalist, lead singer and co-producer.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-02-04 |title=Hotstar: The Steel Woods Build A Career Show By Show - Pollstar News |url=https://news.pollstar.com/2019/02/04/hotstar-the-steel-woods-build-a-career-show-by-show/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Bayliss grew up in [[Woodland, Alabama]], playing music in his family's gospel band and learned to play harmonica, mandolin, and guitar. In 2007, he moved to [[Mobile, Alabama]], where he experimented further on different instruments. Cope began to learn guitar at the age of 11 in his hometown of [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. He later worked as a [[Los Angeles]]-based musician before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 2007 and joined [[Jamey Johnson]]'s band. In his nine years with Johnson, Cope co-wrote "Can't Cash My Checks" and helped Johnson make the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated "[[That Lonesome Song]]" (2008) and "[[The Guitar Song]]" (2010).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pisgahbrewing.com/shows/the-steel-woods/|title=The Steel Woods|last=Pisgah|first=Brewing|date=July 29, 2019|website=Pisgah Brewing|access-date=April 16, 2020|archive-date=April 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408015228/http://www.pisgahbrewing.com/shows/the-steel-woods/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the early days of The Steel Woods, Bayliss and Cope spent a lot of time fishing and writing what would eventually evolve into the bands first studio album, ''Straw in the Wind'' (2017) released on [[Thirty Tigers]]/Woods Music. The album featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Lindi Ortega]], and [[Brent Cobb]] also contributed as a songwriter. On June 10, 2017, it reached number 42 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/independent-albums/2017-06-09|title=Independent Albums Chart|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>

In the subsequent years, the band toured with fellow [[Southern rock]] artists [[Cody Johnson]], [[Cody Jinks]], [[Whiskey Myers]], and [[Blackberry Smoke]] as well as inspirations such as [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[Miranda Lambert]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=The Steel Woods – MoxieTalk with Kirt Jacobs |url=https://moxietalk.com/episodes/thesteelwoods/ |access-date=2020-04-16 |website=MoxieTalk |language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Boston Red Sox]] (known at the time for beards they'd grown during the playoffs) adopted the song as their anthem during the lead-up to the [[2013 World Series]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mtstandard.com/news/local/butte-native-reaches-new-heights-with-new-single-release-kid/article_766c9ce7-0714-5529-a5ad-5ab205726ed6.html |title=Butte Native Reaches New Heights with New Single Release |access-date=2017-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030005955/http://mtstandard.com/news/local/butte-native-reaches-new-heights-with-new-single-release-kid/article_766c9ce7-0714-5529-a5ad-5ab205726ed6.html |archive-date=2017-10-30 |url-status=live}}</ref> The Shrednecks and Gibbons recorded a custom version for the post-season (with lyrics referencing Red Sox highlights and Boston landmarks).<ref name="NESN.com">{{Cite news |date=October 24, 2013 |title=Tim Montana Remakes 'These Beards Came Here to Party' Featuring Lyrics About Boston, Red Sox Highlights (Video) |work=NESN.com |url=https://nesn.com/2013/10/tim-montana-remakes-these-beards-came-here-to-party-featuring-lyrics-about-boston-red-sox-highlights-video/ |url-status=live |access-date=2017-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020033845/https://nesn.com/2013/10/tim-montana-remakes-these-beards-came-here-to-party-featuring-lyrics-about-boston-red-sox-highlights-video/ |archive-date=2017-10-20}}</ref> Montana and the band later returned to sing [[The Star-Spangled Banner]] at [[Fenway Park]] at a May 28, 2013, ceremony honoring the winning [[2004 World Series]] Red Sox team.<ref name="boston.cbslocal.com">{{Cite web |title=Tim Montana and the Shrednecks Sing National Anthem at Fenway Park, Then on Flight Home |url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/06/03/tim-montana-and-the-shrednecks-sing-national-anthem-at-fenway-park-then-on-flight-home/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020032828/http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/06/03/tim-montana-and-the-shrednecks-sing-national-anthem-at-fenway-park-then-on-flight-home/ |archive-date=2017-10-20 |access-date=2017-09-01}}</ref>

Following the release of "This Beard Came Here to Party," Gibbons invited Tim Montana to open for ZZ Top on tour. Tim Montana and the Shrednecks have continued to appear with ZZ Top and opened for [[Kid Rock]] on various tour dates during the summer of 2016.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/10-new-country-artists-you-need-to-know-july-2016-20160701/tim-montana-the-shrednecks-20160630 |title=10 New Country Artists You Need to Know: July 2016 |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=July 2016 |access-date=2017-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312080240/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/10-new-country-artists-you-need-to-know-july-2016-20160701/tim-montana-the-shrednecks-20160630 |archive-date=2018-03-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On February 24, 2016, Tim Montana released the album ''Tim Montana and the Shrednecks,'' featuring Gibbons on four tracks.

Tim Montana released the single "Hillbilly Rich" on September 8, 2017. He released a video for the song on September 19 which features friend Robert J. O'Neill and "Streetbike" Tommy Passemante from MTV's Nitro Circus. In their review of the video, ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that its "aspirational swagger is perfectly on message for Montana's eclectic musical influences".[15] Actor Charlie Sheen took an interest in the video stating on Twitter "this is a stone-cold masterpiece! my man is flat out Killin the Game" to his millions of followers.[16] Shortly after Tim met Charlie in person, Charlie went on to write and direct Tim's music video "Mostly Stoned" which created a press storm that ultimately led to Tim signing with Music Knox Records/BBR Music Group which is part of the BMG Rights Management family.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title= Tim Montana Mostly Stoned|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 29, 2019 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/tim-montana-mostly-stoned-video-charlie-sheen-905334/}}</ref>

As a songwriter Montana co-wrote "Tennessee Mountain Top" and "Greatest Show on Earth" for Kid Rock's 2017 "Sweet Southern Sugar" album.  Both of which went on to chart in the top 40.  He also co-wrote Travis Tritt's "Smoke in a Bar",<ref>{{Cite web |last=Churilla |first=Ken |date=March 4, 2021 |title=Travis Tritt Releases Single "Smoke in A Bar"; First New Music in 13 Years |url=https://americansongwriter.com/travis-tritt-releases-single-smoke-in-a-bar-first-new-music-in-13-years/ |access-date=2023-04-28 |website=American Songwriter |language=en-US}}</ref> Billy F Gibbons "I was a Highway" and Michael Ray's "Higher Education" which featured Montana, Billy F Gibbons, Lee Brice and Kid Rock.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Holthouse |first=Jerry |date=November 3, 2021 |title=Watch: Michael Ray's "Higher Education" |url=https://www.nashville.com/watch-michael-rays-higher-education/ |access-date=2023-04-28 |website=Nashville.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Montana is a vocal supporter of U.S. military veterans. After watching the film ''[[American Sniper]]'' (which tells the story of the late U.S. Navy SEAL [[Chris Kyle]]), Montana became involved in the welfare of veterans suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]]. He approached [[Gibson guitars]] to create a custom Chris Kyle guitar, decorated with Kyle's skull-and-crosshairs logo. The guitar was auctioned off, raising $117,500 for the Guardians of Heroes Foundation, helping wounded U.S. soldiers.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tim-montana-talks-chris-kyle-legacy-american-sniper-guitar-20160601 |title=Tim Montana Talks Chris Kyle Legacy, American Sniper Guitar |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=2017-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202104329/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tim-montana-talks-chris-kyle-legacy-american-sniper-guitar-20160601 |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=live}}</ref>

''' James Travis Tritt''' (born February 9, 1963)  is an American [[country music|country]] singer-songwriter. He signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1989, releasing seven studio albums and a greatest hits package for the label between then and 1999. In the 2000s, he released three studio albums on [[Columbia Records]] and one for the now-defunct [[Category 5 Records]]. Seven of his albums (counting the Greatest Hits) are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA); the highest-certified is 1991's ''[[It's All About to Change]]'', which is certified triple-platinum. Tritt has also charted more than 40 times on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including five number ones—"[[Help Me Hold On]]", "[[Anymore (Travis Tritt song)|Anymore]]", "[[Can I Trust You with My Heart]]", "[[Foolish Pride (Travis Tritt song)|Foolish Pride]]", and "[[Best of Intentions]]"—and 15 additional top ten singles. Tritt's musical style is defined by mainstream country and [[Southern rock]] influences.

He has received two [[Grammy Awards]], both for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]: in 1992 for "[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]", a duet with [[Marty Stuart]], and again in 1998 for "Same Old Train", a collaboration with Stuart and nine other artists. He has received four awards from the [[Country Music Association]] and has been a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] since 1992.

==Early life==
James Travis Tritt was born on February 9, 1963, in [[Marietta, Georgia]], to James and Gwen Tritt.  He first took interest in singing after his church's Sunday school choir performed "[[Everything Is Beautiful]]".<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 2</ref> He received his first guitar at age 8 and taught himself how to play it; in the fourth grade, he performed "[[Annie's Song]]" and "[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]" for his class, and later got invited to play for other classrooms in his school.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 3</ref> At age 14, his parents bought him another guitar, and he learned more songs from his uncle, Sam Lockhart.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 4</ref> Later on, Tritt joined his church band, which occasionally performed at other churches nearby.<ref name="thirteen">Tritt and Bane, p. 13</ref>

Tritt began writing music while he was attending [[Sprayberry High School]]; his first song composition, entitled "Spend a Little Time", was written about a girlfriend whom he had broken up with.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 17</ref> He performed the song for his friends, one of whom complimented him on his songwriting skills.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 20</ref> He also founded a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group with some of his friends and won second place in a local tournament for playing "[[Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]".<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 35–36</ref>

During his teenage years, Tritt worked at a furniture store, and later as a supermarket clerk. He lived with his mother after she and his father divorced; they remarried when he was 18.<ref name="thirty-nine">, Tritt and Bane, pp. 39–41</ref> He worked at an air conditioning company while playing in clubs, but gave up the air conditioning job at the suggestion of one of his bandmates.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 46</ref> Tritt's father thought that he would not find success as a musician, while his mother thought that he should perform Christian music instead of country.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

Through the assistance of [[Warner Bros. Records]] executive Danny Davenport, Tritt began recording [[demo (music)|demos]]. The two worked together for the next several years, eventually putting together a demo album called ''Proud of the Country''.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 64</ref> Davenport sent the demo to Warner Bros. representatives in Los Angeles, who in turn sent the demo to their Nashville division, which signed Tritt in 1987.<ref name="stabler">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Stambler|first2=Lyndon|last3=Laudon|first3=Grelon|title=Country music: the encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22travis+tritt%22&pg=PA500|year=1997|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-26487-9}}</ref> Davenport also helped Tritt find a [[talent manager]], Ken Kragen. At first, Kragen was not interested in taking an "entry-level act", but decided to sign on as Tritt's manager after Kragen's wife convinced him.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 102</ref>

==Musical career==

===1989–1991: ''Country Club''===
Tritt's contract with Warner Bros.  meant that he was signed to record six songs, and three of them would be released as singles. According to the contract, he would not be signed on for a full album unless one of the three singles became a hit.<ref name="stabler" /><ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 94</ref> His first single was "[[Country Club (song)|Country Club]]". Recorded in late 1988 and released on August 7, 1989,<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 98</ref> the song spent 26 weeks on the [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts, peaking at number nine.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=427–428|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> It was the title track to his 1990 debut album ''[[Country Club (album)|Country Club]]'', produced by Gregg Brown. The month of its release, Tritt burst a blood vessel on his vocal cords, and had to take vocal rest for a month.<ref name="stabler" /> Second single "[[Help Me Hold On]]" became his first number one single in 1990.<ref name="whitburn"/> The album's third and fifth singles, "[[I'm Gonna Be Somebody]]" and "[[Drift Off to Dream]]", respectively peaked at numbers two and three on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts, and number one on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.1316&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=uvsk2ptt6nbkarbs9e98rh1n34|title=RPM Country Tracks for August 25, 1990|work=RPM|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.1526&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=05ij8b9g2celva9nckkrvfs936|title=RPM Country Tracks for May 25, 1991|work=RPM|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> "I'm Gonna Be Somebody" also went to number one on the U.S. country singles charts published by ''[[Radio & Records]]''.<ref name="stabler" /> "[[Put Some Drive in Your Country]]", which was released fourth, peaked at 28 on Hot Country Songs.<ref name="whitburn"/> ''Country Club'' was [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in July 1991 for shipments of one million copies, and no medals since in 1996.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Travis%20Tritt&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=Search results for Travis Tritt|work=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=September 22, 2010}}</ref> In 1990, he won the Top New Male Artist award from ''Billboard''.<ref name="opry">{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artists/t/Tritt_Travis.html|title=Travis Tritt Biography|work=[[Grand Ole Opry]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> The [[Country Music Association]] (CMA) also nominated him for the Horizon Award (now known as the New Artist Award),<ref name="stabler" /> which is given to new artists who show have shown the most significant artistic and commercial development from a first or second album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaawards.com/about/overview.aspx|title=About the awards|work=Country Music Association|access-date=September 26, 2010}}</ref>

[[Brian Mansfield]] of [[AllMusic]] gave the album a positive review, saying that "Put Some Drive in Your Country" paid homage to Tritt's influences, but that the other singles were more radio-friendly.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r94384|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Country Club'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> Giving the album a B-minus, [[Alanna Nash]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared Tritt's music to that of [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] and [[Joe Stampley]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316906,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221043456/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316906,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 21, 2009|title=We review new music from Travis Tritt, Kris Kristofferson, Alan Jackson, and more|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=March 16, 1990|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

===1991–1992: ''It's All About to Change''===
In 1991, Tritt received a second Horizon Award nomination, which he won that year.<ref name="opry"/> He also released his second album, ''[[It's All About to Change]]''. The album went on to become his bestselling, with a triple-platinum certification from the RIAA for shipments of three million copies.<ref name="riaa"/> All four of its singles reached the top five on the country music charts. "[[Here's a Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares)]]" and the [[Marty Stuart]] duet "[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]", respectively the first and third singles, both reached number two, with the number-one "[[Anymore (Travis Tritt song)|Anymore]]" in between. "[[Nothing Short of Dying]]" was the fourth single, with a peak at number four on ''Billboard'';<ref name="whitburn"/> both it and "The Whiskey Ain't Working" went to Number One on ''Radio & Records''.<ref name="stabler"/> "Bible Belt", another cut from the album (recorded in collaboration with [[Little Feat]]), appeared in the 1992 film ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'' (the lyrics for the song, however, were changed for the version played in the movie to match the story line). Although not released as a single, it peaked at number 72 country based on unsolicited airplay and was the [[b-side]] to "Nothing Short of Dying".<ref name="whitburn"/> "Bible Belt" was inspired by a youth pastor whom Tritt knew in his childhood.<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 12–13</ref>

Stuart offered "The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Anymore" to Tritt backstage at the CMA awards show, and they recorded it as a duet through the suggestion of Tritt's record producer, Gregg Brown.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 190</ref> The duet won both artists the next year's [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].<ref name="whitburn"/> Tritt and Stuart charted a second duet, "[[This One's Gonna Hurt You (For a Long, Long Time)]]", which went to number seven in mid-1992 and appeared on Stuart's album ''[[This One's Gonna Hurt You]]''.<ref name="whitburn"/> This song won the 1992 CMA award for Vocal Event of the Year.<ref name="opry"/>

In June 1992, Tritt received media attention when he criticized [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]' "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]" at a Fan Fair interview, saying that he did not think that Cyrus' song made a "statement".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lTkpAAAAIBAJ&pg=3077,2956775&dq=travis-tritt+billy-ray-cyrus+statement&hl=en|title=Tritt pans Cyrus tune, video|date=June 12, 1992|work=Sun Journal|access-date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> The following January, Cyrus responded at the [[American Music Awards]] by referring to Tritt's "Here's a Quarter".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i9srAAAAIBAJ&pg=1859,2275018&dq=travis-tritt+billy-ray-cyrus&hl=en|title=Cyrus gives Tritt no quarter|date=January 28, 1993|work=Kentucky New Era|access-date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> Tritt later apologized to Cyrus, but said that he defended his opinion on the song.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 161</ref>

===1992–1993: ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' and ''A Travis Tritt Christmas''===
Tritt and Stuart began a "No Hats Tour" in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/78488388.html?dids=78488388:78488388&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+09%2C+1992&author=Jim+Abbott+of+The+Sentinel+Staff&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=TRAVIS+TRITT&pqatl=google|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104003318/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/78488388.html?dids=78488388:78488388&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+09,+1992&author=Jim+Abbott+of+The+Sentinel+Staff&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=TRAVIS+TRITT&pqatl=google|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 4, 2012|title=Travis Tritt|last=Abbott|first=Jim|date=October 9, 1992|work=[[The Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> In August of that same year, Tritt released the album ''[[T-R-O-U-B-L-E (album)|T-R-O-U-B-L-E]]''. Its first single was "[[Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man]]", a song written by [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]]. This song, which featured backing vocals from [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[T. Graham Brown]], [[George Jones]], [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]], [[Dana McVicker]] (who also sang backup on Tritt's first two albums), [[Tanya Tucker]] and [[Porter Wagoner]] on the final chorus, peaked at number five.<ref name="whitburn"/> Its follow-up, "[[Can I Trust You with My Heart]]", became Tritt's third ''Billboard'' number one in early 1993.<ref name="whitburn"/> The album's next three singles did not perform as well on the charts: the [[T-R-O-U-B-L-E (song)|title track]] (a cover of an [[Elvis Presley]] song<ref name="trouble"/>), peaked at 13, followed by "[[Looking Out for Number One (Travis Tritt song)|Looking Out for Number One]]" at number 11 and "Worth Every Mile" at number 30.<ref name="whitburn"/> ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' became the second album of his career to achieve double-platinum certification.<ref name="riaa"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic thought that ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' followed too closely the formula of ''It's All About to Change'', but said that the songs showed Tritt's personality.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r123596|pure_url=yes}}|title=''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> Nash gave the album a similar criticism, but praised the rock influences of "Looking Out for Number One" and the vocals on "Can I Trust You with My Heart".<ref name="trouble">{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1992/09/04/t-r-o-u-b-l-e/|title=''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=September 4, 1992|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

One month after the release of ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'', Tritt issued a Christmas album titled ''[[A Travis Tritt Christmas: Loving Time of the Year]]'', for which he wrote the title track.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r123617|pure_url=yes}}|title=''A Travis Tritt Christmas: Loving Time of the Year'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> He also joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]], a weekly stage show and radio broadcast specializing in country music performances,<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 115</ref> and filled in for [[Garth Brooks]] at a performance on the [[American Music Awards]].<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 179</ref> By year's end, Tritt and several other artists appeared on [[George Jones]]'s "[[I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair]]", which won all artists involved the next year's CMA Vocal Event of the Year award.<ref>Whitburn, p. 215</ref>

===1994–1995: ''Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof'' and ''Greatest Hits''===
In early 1994, after "Worth Every Mile" fell from the charts, Tritt charted at number 21 with a cover of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' "[[Take It Easy]]".<ref name="whitburn"/> He recorded this song for the tribute album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'' (released through Warner Bros.' [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] division), which featured country music artists' renditions of Eagles songs.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r188406|pure_url=yes}}|title=Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles|website=AllMusic|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> When filming the music video for this song, Tritt requested that the band, which had been on hiatus for over 13 years, appear in it. This reunion inspired the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over Tour, which began that year.<ref name="stabler"/>

His fourth album, ''[[Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof]]'', was released that May. Its lead-off single, "[[Foolish Pride (Travis Tritt song)|Foolish Pride]]", went to number one, and the fourth single, "[[Tell Me I Was Dreaming]]", reached number two. In between these songs were the title track at number 22 and "[[Between an Old Memory and Me]]" (originally recorded by [[Keith Whitley]]<ref name="tenfeet"/>) at number 11.<ref name="whitburn"/> The album included two co-writes with [[Gary Rossington]] of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], and guest vocals from [[Waylon Jennings]] and Hank Williams, Jr. on the cut "Outlaws Like Us".<ref name="bulletproof">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r202312|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof'' review|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> The album achieved platinum certification in December of that year, and later became his third double-platinum album.<ref name="riaa"/> AllMusic reviewer Brian Mansfield said that Tritt was "most comfortable with his Southern rock/outlaw mantle" on it, comparing "Foolish Pride" favorably to "Anymore" and the work of [[Bob Seger]].<ref name="bulletproof"/> Alanna Nash praised the title track and "Tell Me I Was Dreaming" in her review for ''Entertainment Weekly'', but thought that the other songs were still too similar in sound to his previous works.<ref name="tenfeet">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302220,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122073730/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302220,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 22, 2008|title=''Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof'' review|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=May 23, 1994|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

1995's ''[[Greatest Hits: From the Beginning (Travis Tritt album)|Greatest Hits: From the Beginning]]'' included most of his singles to that point, as well as two new cuts: the [[Steve Earle]] composition "[[Sometimes She Forgets]]" and a cover of the pop standard "[[Only You (And You Alone)]]". The former was a top ten hit at number seven, while the latter spent only eight weeks on the country charts and peaked at number 51.<ref name="whitburn"/> ''Greatest Hits'' was certified platinum.<ref name="riaa"/>

===1996–1997: ''The Restless Kind''===
In April 1996, Tritt and Stuart charted a third duet, "[[Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best (song)|Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best]]", which appeared on Stuart's [[Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best|album of the same name]] and peaked at 23 on the country charts. The song won both artists that year's Country Music Association award for Vocal Event, Tritt's third win in this category.<ref name="whitburn"/> The two began a second tour, the Double Trouble Tour, that year.<ref name="stabler" />

Tritt charted at number three in mid-1996 with "[[More Than You'll Ever Know]]", the first single from his fifth album, ''[[The Restless Kind]]''. The album accounted for one more top ten hit, a cover of Waylon Jennings's "[[Where Corn Don't Grow]]", which Tritt took to number six in late 1996.

==Musical styles==
Although he had been singing since childhood, Tritt said that he began to put "a little more soul" in his voice after his church band performed at an African-American church. He said that he took interest in how African-American singers put "all these bends and sweeps and curls" in their voices, and began emulating that sound.<ref name="thirteen"/> While performing at these churches, he also took interest in gospel singers such as [[Andraé Crouch]].<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 14</ref> Later on, he began listening to [[Southern rock]] acts such as [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] through the recommendation of a friend,<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 29–30</ref> as well as the bluegrass music that his uncle exposed him to.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 34</ref> Tritt said that he found his songwriting began to develop during the creation of his demo tape, when he had written a song called "Gambler's Blues" that "felt a lot more connected to Southern rock" than his previous writings.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 63</ref> He cites country, rock and [[folk music|folk]] as his influences.<ref name="opry"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine contrasts him with contemporaries [[Clint Black]] and [[Alan Jackson]], saying that Tritt was "the only one not to wear a [cowboy] hat and the only one to dip into bluesy Southern rock. Consequently, he developed a gutsy, outlaw image that distinguished him from the pack."<ref name="AllMusic"/> Zell Miller, in the book ''They Heard Georgia Singing'', said that Tritt has an "unerring ability to walk the narrow path between his country heritage and his rock leanings to the acclaim of the devotees of both."<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Zell|title=They Heard Georgia Singing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kv8EdRRkiQC&q=%22travis+tritt%22&pg=PA293|year=1996|publisher=0865545049|pages=293–294|isbn=9780865545045}}</ref>

Regarding his songwriting style and single choices, Tritt said that he writes "strictly from personal experiences" and does not follow a particular formula.<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 22-23</ref> He described "Here's a Quarter" as "one of the simplest three-chord [[waltz]]es I've ever written",<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 25</ref> and said that label executives were reluctant to release it because they thought that it was a [[novelty song]].<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 136</ref> Also, he was told that "I'm Gonna Be Somebody" would not be a hit because it did not contain any rhymes,<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 23</ref> and fought the release of the song "Country Club" because he did not think that it fit his style.<ref>Tritt and Bane, pp. 137–138</ref> He also said that, despite their low peaks, the more rock-influenced "Put Some Drive in Your Country" and "T-R-O-U-B-L-E" helped generate sales for their respective albums more so than the top ten hits from those albums.<ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 138</ref>

===Political views and advocacy===
Tritt is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and supported [[George W. Bush]] for president in 2000. The two met in 1996 at the [[Republican National Convention]] in San Diego, California, where Tritt sang the national anthem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1474994/tritt-open-about-political-leanings/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627194834/http://www.cmt.com/news/1474994/tritt-open-about-political-leanings/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 27, 2019|title=Tritt Open About Political Leanings|publisher=Country Music Television|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> Tritt told [[Insight on the News]] that he is a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and believes the answer to crime is not gun control but criminal control. "I'm a pro-gun guy. I'm an NRA ([[National Rifle Association of America]]) member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with. I think that sends much more of an incentive for people to not commit crimes of any type than taking away guns. Because you take away guns, and the next thing you know, stabbing murders are going to increase." He adds that he is "definitely pro-death penalty".{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In September 2020, Tritt gained notoriety for joining fellow Republican [[James Woods]] in blocking random [[Twitter]] users for using pro-[[Black Lives Matter]] and other anti-Trump tags in their posts, under the belief that it would counteract anti-Republican sentiment on Twitter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meaww.com/who-is-travis-tritt-musician-backs-james-woods-block-resisters-why-is-he-blocking-urge-trumpers/|title=Who is Travis Tritt?

In April 2023, as a protest against [[Bud Light]] for supporting transgender influencer [[Dylan Mulvaney]], Tritt Tweeted "I will be deleting all Anheuser-Busch products from my tour hospitality rider."<ref>{{Cite web |title=https://twitter.com/Travistritt/status/1643765186736553984 |url=https://twitter.com/Travistritt/status/1643765186736553984 |access-date=April 18, 2023 |website=Twitter |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Holpuch |first=Amanda |date=April 14, 2023 |title=Behind the Backlash Against Bud Light's Transgender Influencer |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/business/bud-light-boycott.html |access-date=April 18, 2023 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===Alleged paranormal encounters===
In October 2015, Tritt appeared on Lifetime network's ''[[The Haunting of...]]'' program to discuss his experiences with the paranormal. Tritt stated that beginning in 1993, he was awakened "regularly" by disembodied voices in a vacation cabin that he owned – the voices spoke in an unknown dialect. His wife, Theresa, eventually heard them as well. According to Tritt, "Over the years, these voices started happening
on such a frequent basis that we were afraid to come up here." He also asserted that footprints once appeared in the carpet of the cabin, and imprints in the bedspread, that belonged to neither him nor his wife.

The show's host, Kim Russo, concluded that an African-American medicine man had been stabbed and beaten to death on the property, and the voices that Tritt was hearing belonged to the murderers' angry spirits. A title card in the program notes that "On August 14, 1875, a group of men killed a '[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] doctor' close to the land where Travis' cabin was built." Russo believed that the hoodoo doctor's spirit also lingered on the property because it found a "kindred spirit" in Tritt.<ref>[http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/the-haunting-of/season-4/episode-9] {{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3di96b|title=The Haunting Of S05E22 – Travis Tritt – video|website=Dailymotion.com|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>

They have released six albums, the latest being ''[[Tornillo_(album)|Tornillo]]'' released in July 2022.

==Music career==
In 2008, the band released their debut album, ''Road of Life''.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0001002713|pure_url=yes}} |title=Whiskey Myers Biography |last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=July 31, 2012}}</ref> Their second album, ''Firewater'', was released by Wiggy Thump in 2011 and debuted in the Top 30 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart, largely thanks to the single "Ballad of a Southern Man". On February 4, 2014, the album, ''Early Morning Shakes'', was released and received mostly positive reviews. In September 2016, their fourth album ''Mud'' was released. The band's self-titled album was released on September 27, 2019 followed by "Tornillo" in July 29, 2022.

The band started when friends Cody Cannon and John Jeffers began learning guitar together, inspired by the music of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Waylon Jennings]], amongst many other artists. After being joined by Cannon's co-worker and friend Cody Tate. After playing together for a while, the three decided to start a more serious band. They enlisted friend Jeff Hogg to play drums, and asked Cannon's cousin Gary Brown to play bass (although he did not know how to play the instrument at the time). They began playing shows around their hometown and native state of Texas, slowly starting to build a following on the Texas/Red Dirt scene.

In 2018, the band was featured in four episodes of the [[Kevin Costner]] [[Paramount Network]] series [[Yellowstone (American TV series)|''Yellowstone'']]. Shortly afterwards, the band's three available albums moved into the top 10 iTunes country chart. Their most recent album at the time, ''Mud'', reached No. 1 on the charts, and its song "Stone" reached No. 9 in all genres. 

On September 27, 2019, the band released the self-titled album, ''[[Whiskey Myers (album)|Whiskey Myers]]''.

'''Will Hoge''' (born November 14, 1972<ref name="tennessean.com">[http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080822/ENTERTAINMENT01/80822064 ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>) is an American [[Americana (music)|Americana]] [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and [[musician]] from [[Nashville, Tennessee]], United States.

==Early life==
Will Hoge was born and grew up in [[Franklin, Tennessee]], located just south of Nashville.  His sound was influenced by his musician father and uncles and the extensive record collection that his father kept.

Hoge attended [[Western Kentucky University]] to study history, planning to become a high school history teacher and basketball coach.  He decided that he wanted to try his hand at [[rock and roll]] and began writing music.  Will left the university after realizing he wanted to be a musician.

==Early band==
Will released an early [[extended play|EP]] of original music with his band Spoonful in the mid-1990s.  However, the band was not picked up and eventually disbanded.  Some of these early songs were recycled on later albums, and are still hits with his loyal followers.

==Solo artist==
[[File:Will Hoge Concert.jpg|thumb|left|Hoge in concert, September 25, 2010 in Nashville]]With former [[The Georgia Satellites]] guitarist [[Dan Baird]] in tow, Hoge began touring the American south.  He independently released his first [[compact disc|CD]], ''Live At The Exit/In'', a live set recorded at the Nashville club.  His original sound drew much attention and, through constant touring, he was able to release his first studio album, ''Carousel''.

Hoge caught the attention of [[Atlantic Records]] music executives and he was signed to a record deal in early 2002.  Atlantic then re-released ''Carousel'' to a wider market.  His 2003 major label debut, ''Blackbird On A Lonely Wire'' was a cleaner sounding effort; however, the album was poorly promoted by Atlantic.  Eventually, Hoge asked for and received a release from his contract, re-obtaining the rights to ''Carousel''.

The support of his fans has given Hoge the ability to tour incessantly, and self-release a couple live albums (2004's ''Almost Alone: Live At Smith's Olde Bar''' and 2005's ''During the Before and After''), a politically charged album called ''The America EP'' (which included a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are A-Changin']])", and a bluesy rock and roll sounding album, ''The Man Who Killed Love''.

Over the years, Hoge has toured with many artists, including [[Midnight Oil]], [[Shinedown]], [[Needtobreathe]], [[Marc Broussard]], [[ZZ Top]], [[The Cat Empire]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Edwin McCain]].  Bands that have opened for him include [[Steel Train]], [[The Trews]], [[The Elms (band)|The Elms]], [[Rose Hill Drive]], [[Needtobreathe]], [[Moses Mayfield]], [[The Alternate Routes]], [[Aslyn]], [[Katie Herzig]], [[Missy Higgins]], and [[The Civil Wars]].

Hoge recorded the opening theme song, "You Make Me Happy," for the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Still Standing (American TV series)|Still Standing]]''.

On February 20, 2007, he released a live album, ''Again Somewhere Tomorrow'', from recordings made during the band's two-night stint at the Exit/In in Nashville, in September 2006.

The band's fourth studio album, ''Draw the Curtains'', was released nationwide in October 2007 by [[Rykodisc Records]]. The album was initially released as a [[CD]], with a limited edition 180-Gram [[Vinyl Record]] version which followed later.

Following a scooter accident in August 2008, the band went on hiatus for seven months while Hoge recuperated from his injuries.  In April 2009, the band got together for a 3-week acoustic tour of venues in the Midwest, Southeast and East Coast, hitting cities including New York City, Chicago, Nashville and Atlanta.  When the tour ended in late April, the band headed back into the studio to complete recording their next album (of which they had begun at the time of Hoge's accident).  Ken Coomer and Charlie Brocco again produced, and the album, ''The Wreckage'', was released on September 29, 2009.

Will Hoge performed a residency at 12th & Porter in [[Nashville, tn|Nashville, TN]] in June 2010.  During these concerts, many of Hoge's friends, family, and former bandmates joined him on stage during the run of the four shows.  These guests included former guitarists [[Dan Baird]], Brian Layson, and Jason 'Slim' Gambill; former keyboard players Jefferson Crowe and John Lancaster; as well as Will's own father, who sang lead vocals on the final song of the concert series.

On August 29, 2009, Will and the band appeared and performed the single "[[Even If It Breaks Your Heart]]" on the [[CBS Early Show]] as the music guest.

Hoge opened for [[Needtobreathe]] on their spring 2010 tour.  He also opened shows for [[Sugarland]] and [[Michelle Branch]] on select dates during their summer tour.

Hoge was part of a line-up, which included [[Keith Urban]], [[Dierks Bentley]], and [[Sheryl Crow]], that performed on the nationally televised "[[Music City Keep On Playin']]" flood relief program that aired on [[Great American Country|GAC]] on May 16, 2010.  Hoge closed the show by performing his song "Washed By The Water."

Hoge opened for mainstream rock band [[Shinedown]] on their acoustic "Anything & Everything" tour in the fall of 2010.

In September 2011, Hoge released his 7th studio album entitled 'Number Seven'.  The album was his third release via Ryko.  This time around, Hoge took over production duties for the entire album.  The album's first single "When I Get My Wings" was released to radio in August 2011.  The official music video for the song was added into rotation on both [[VH1]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0EIxUWO_0M&ob=av2n |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2016-01-04}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead YouTube link|date=February 2022}}</ref>  During this time, Hoge was invited to perform on three separate occasions at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], with country legend [[Vince Gill]] playing guitar and singing background vocals on a couple songs during his first appearance (Gill is a guest artist on 'Seven' as well, as he and his wife, [[Amy Grant]] are fans of Hoge).

In a September 2012 blog post on his website, Hoge announced a number of changes.  He left Rykodisc Records after releasing three albums with them. Longtime drummer Sigurdur 'Siggi' Birkis was released from the band.  They have yet to hire a permanent replacement.  He also announced in a Twitter post that [[Lady Antebellum]] was recording a cover of his song "Better Off Now" from his 2003 release "Blackbird On A Lonely Wire" which will be included on their next album.

In October 2012, Hoge announced, via Twitter, than he has signed a songwriting deal with BMG Nashville.

Hoge received a Country Music Association nomination, an Academy of Country Music nomination and a Grammy nomination for "Country Song of the Year" for "Even If It Breaks Your Heart". The song was recorded by the Eli Young Band and reached #1 on the country charts.

In 2013, he released ''[[Never Give In (Will Hoge album)|Never Give In]]''.  The album debuted at 129 on the Billboard 200, his highest debut on the chart, selling 3,000 copies in the US.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2013/10/13907-country-album-chart-news-the-week-of-october-23-2013-scotty-mccreery-willie-nelson-duets-chase-rice-cassadee-pope-lead/ |title= Country Album Chart News: The Week of October 23, 2013: Scotty McCreery, Willie Nelson Duets, Chase Rice, Cassadee Pope Lead|author= Matt Bjorke |date= October 23, 2013 |work=Roughstock }}</ref> The album's final track "Strong" was featured in a television commercial for Chevy trucks and contributed to the album's success.

On April 7, 2015, Hoge released his album ''Small Town Dream''.  The album debuted at No. 162 on the [[Billboard 200]] and No. 15 on the Top Country Albums chart, selling 3,700 copies for the week.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2015/04/34260-country-album-chart-report-april-15-2015/ |title=Country Album Chart Report For April 15, 2015 |author= Matt Bjorke |date= April 15, 2015 |website=Roughstock.com|access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EU88r4wxrG4FTpfeCEwITPzwOmXju-uOIenH4ILNNG0/edit#gid=0 |title=10 Country Albums - April 15, 2015 - Google Sheets |website=Docs.google.com |date=2015-04-15 |access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref>

On August 11, 2017, Hoge released ''[[Anchors (Will Hoge album)|Anchors]]'', which debuted at No. 14 on the Independent Albums chart,<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/independent-albums/2017-09-02|title= Independent Albums: Week of September 2, 2017|magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 12, 2017}}</ref>  with 1,900 copies sold in its first week.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2017/08/42177-top-10-country-albums-sales-chart-august-20-2017 |title=Top 10 Country Albums Sales Chart: August 21, 2017 |first= Matt |last= Bjorke |date= August 22, 2017 |work=Roughstock }}</ref>

In 2018 Hoge released his 11th studio album, the politically-charged ''My American Dream''. He also toured with punk rock band Social Distortion after lead singer Mike Ness heard Hoge on satellite radio, thanks to a free subscription with his new car.  Ness invited Hoge to tour together.<ref>as told by Hoge and Ness in Toronto, ON 2018-10-10</ref>

Hoge's next album, ''Tiny Little Movies'', was released in June 2020. His latest effort, ''Wings On My Shoes'', is slated for release on 26 August 2022.

==Motorcycle accident==
Hoge was involved in a motorcycle accident on August 20, 2008 after leaving a studio session for what would be his next album, "The Wreckage." He was traveling north on Main Street in [[East Nashville]] at about 8 p.m. when a van traveling southbound failed to yield while turning into 712 Main St.  Hoge's motorcycle collided with the passenger side of the van. He was admitted to [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] in critical condition.  He went into surgery immediately upon arrival at the hospital for numerous broken bones (ribs, sternum, shattered femur, knee cap, shoulder blades), and lacerations to his face, arms, and torso requiring over 200 stitches.  Hoge's condition was upgraded to stable on August 22.<ref name="tennessean.com"/>  No evidence was found that alcohol or drugs were involved in the accident.<ref>[http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080821/TUNEIN/80821015 ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>

In the year following the accident, Hoge went through numerous surgical procedures (mainly on his shattered femur/leg) and intensive physical therapy.  Work on ''The Wreckage'', as well as tour dates, were postponed through spring 2009.  Since that point, Hoge has made a full recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.willhoge.com/blog?descp=update-on-will&maindivId=&divId=1&subId=1&main= |title=News — Will Hoge |website=Willhoge.com |date=2015-02-06 |access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2015}}
In 2002, Brown was traveling with a heavy tour schedule of approximately 200 dates a year. The initial Zac Brown Band lineup consisted of Brown, on acoustic guitar and lead vocals, backed by drummer Marcus Petruska and bass guitarist Jacob Lawson. In 2003, Brown started his own label, called Home Grown—it was later renamed "Southern Ground".

In 2004, Brown opened a music club and restaurant with his father in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia, called "Zac's Place" where the fare was southern-style cooking. A developer bought the restaurant and, in turn, the Zac Brown Band bought a tour bus and began touring full-time, playing rock and country clubs, as well as folk and jam band festivals. The release of the Zac Brown Band's first independent album, ''Home Grown'', occurred during the same year.

Also in 2004, Brown added violinist/fiddler and tenor vocalist Jimmy De Martini to the lineup. According to an interview with De Martini, he explained that Wyatt Durrette, Brown's frequent songwriting collaborator, was working as a bartender at Sidelines Sports Bar in [[Kennesaw, Georgia]], at the time, where the Zac Brown Band frequently performed. Durette suggested De Martini to Brown, who was wanting a "lead instrument" in his band, as well as a harmony singer. After doing several performances with the band at the club, Brown asked De Martini to become a permanent member, to which De Martini gladly obliged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenville.metromix.com/music/article/q-and-a-jimmy/1470971/content|title=Q&A: Jimmy DeMartini of Zac Brown Band|author=Matt Wake|publisher=Metromix Greenville|date=September 17, 2009|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref>

Brown met [[John Driskell Hopkins]] in 1998 when Hopkins was hosting an open mic night at CJ's Landing in Buckhead, Georgia. Hopkins later recorded ''Home Grown'' in his music studio, Brighter Shade Studios. The two remained friends, and in 2005, Hopkins stepped in as bass guitarist while helping the group finish what became their number-one single "Toes". "Toes" was the second single from the band's major-label debut, ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'', which was partially recorded in Hopkins' studio. ''[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]'' was also partially recorded in Brighter Shade Studios.

[[Coy Bowles]] transferred to Atlanta's [[Georgia State University]] to study music. He subsequently became involved in Atlanta's various music scenes, and eventually formed Coy Bowles and the Fellowship in 2004. Two years later, Bowles decided to reconnect with Brown. Through mutual friends, he learned that the Zac Brown Band was scheduled to perform in Atlanta one evening. Bowles and Brown spent the afternoon prior to the performance reacquainting with each other, which ended with Brown inviting Bowles to sit in with his band at that night's performance. To return the favor, Bowles invited the band to attend his own gig with the Fellowship a couple of months later, which in turn resulted in Brown and his band sitting in at that gig.

This turn of events continued for eight months until Bowles concluded that it was too overwhelming to balance his time with Brown's band and his own band, in addition to other activities; he therefore made a decision to put the Fellowship on an indefinite hiatus, and became a permanent member of the Zac Brown Band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/music/about-zbb/|title=About ZBB|work=Coy Bowles|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/coy/about/|title=About|work=Coy Bowles|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref>

In 2008, the Zac Brown Band signed to Live Nation Artists Records, in association with Brown's own Home Grown label, after Chris Fryar became an addition to the band. An [[Alabama]] native, Fryar attended the [[University of North Texas]] and the [[Mississippi University for Women]], and made a name for himself in the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] music scene.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2011/05/and_the_beat_goes_on_gardendal.html|title=The beat goes on: Gardendale drummer Chris Fryar earns fame, stays humble in Zac Brown Band (video)|author=Mary Colurso|newspaper=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=May 27, 2011|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref> According to Fryar, a mutual friend recommended him to Brown, who was in need of a new drummer for the band. Fryar, who in turn had just finished a stint with a previous band, subsequently auditioned and shortly afterward became the Zac Brown Band's newest member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/static/ads/landing_pages/4343_zacbrownband/4343_landing_page.html|title=Landshark Lager - Proud Sponsor of Zac Brown Band|website=Pandora.com|access-date=December 23, 2011}}</ref>

In 2014, with the addition of bass guitarist Matt Mangano to the line-up, Hopkins expanded from his own role as bass guitarist to add other instruments in his arsenal such as standard six-string guitar, seven-string guitar, baritone guitar, ukulele, double bass, and banjo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zacbrownband.com/john-driskell-hopkins.html |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=Zac Brown Band |access-date=August 1, 2014}}</ref>

===Commercial success===
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2015}}
The Zac Brown Band's debut single, "[[Chicken Fried]]", was originally recorded in 2003 and included on the ''Home Grown'' album, but later re-recorded and released to country radio in 2008. This song was also recorded by [[The Lost Trailers]], whose 2006 recording was released as a single but withdrawn after Brown decided that he wanted to release it himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4477828-1.html |title= BNA Forced To Swap Trailers' Single |access-date=June 19, 2008 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=March 15, 2006 |work=Radio Monitor}}</ref> Brown also co-wrote "Simple Life", a song recorded by The Lost Trailers on their 2006 [[The Lost Trailers (album)|self-titled album]].

In the third episode of HBO's music documentary series [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|Sonic Highways]], Brown was a featured interviewee and explained why Lost Trailer's version of "Chicken Fried" was pulled from the radio. Brown stated that after six years of touring that he was broke and sleeping in his tour van. In 2005 the Lost Trailers contacted Brown and expressed interest in recording "Chicken Fried". Brown stated he agreed under the condition that the song would only be an album cut and not a single as he still had hopes of releasing the song as a radio single himself.

Both parties agreed and the Lost Trailers recorded the song. Some months later the Lost Trailers landed a deal with Sony Nashville, and when they submitted the tracks for their album, they included "Chicken Fried". [[Joe Galante]], then the Chairman of Sony Music Nashville, heard the tracks and chose "Chicken Fried" as the single that the label wanted to promote.

Brown described hearing his song on the radio: "The first time I hear 'Chicken Fried' on the radio and it wasn't us singing it. It was a nightmare." Brown then called his lawyer to have the song pulled from the radio immediately. Brown's lawyer warned him that because of Galante's power in the Nashville music scene that pulling the song could essentially have him blackballed in Nashville. Brown was insistent that his agreement with the Lost Trailers was violated, so his lawyer issued a [[cease and desist]] letter and the single was pulled from the radio.

A few months later The Zac Brown Band was booked to perform at 3rd and Lindsley in Nashville and producer [[Keith Stegall]] came to watch their performance. Stegall and Brown had drinks later that night and Brown recalled Stegall stating, "I just had to meet the kid that told Joe Galante to fuck off!" Brown credits this incident and his meeting and collaboration with Stegall as the beginning of his success in the music business.

In October 2008, [[Atlantic Records]] acquired distribution of "Chicken Fried" after Live Nation Artists closed. The band's album ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'' was released under Atlantic Records' newly re-established country division in association with the Home Grown/Bigger Picture label on November 18 of that year.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043645/zac-brown-band-signs-with-atlantic |title=Zac Brown Band Signs With Atlantic  |access-date=October 29, 2008 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=October 29, 2008 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> "Chicken Fried" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts that same month, making them the first country band to reach No.&nbsp;1 with a debut single since [[Heartland (country music band)|Heartland]] did so in 2006 with "[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/charts/chart_alert/e3iac81cb9ace3320f8be5a577c0bd8f3ef |title=Beyonce's 'Fierce' Debut Leads Pre-Turkey Day Chart  |access-date=December 7, 2008|date=November 26, 2008 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

In July 2012, Zac Brown Band debuted their new CD, ''Uncaged'', which was well received. Billboard considered the album to be the best country album of 2012 as of its release.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/481828/zac-brown-band-uncaged-track-by-track-review|title=Zac Brown Band, 'Uncaged': Track-by-Track Review|last=Dauphin|first=Chuck|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 10, 2012|access-date=August 11, 2012}}</ref>

On January 7, 2013, Zac Brown Band performed the National Anthem at the [[2013 BCS National Championship Game]] between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Just two weeks later on January 20, 2013, the band performed the National Anthem during the NFC Championship Game between the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers at the CenturyLink Field in Seattle.

On January 1, 2014, Zac Brown Band performed the National Anthem during the NHL's Winter Classic between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] & [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] at [[Michigan Stadium]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan, home of the [[Michigan Wolverines]] football team.

The Zac Brown Band announced on January 12, 2015, that it had finalized a four-way strategic partnership involving the Southern Ground Artists record label, Big Machine Label Group, Republic Records, and [[John Varvatos]] Records for the release of its fourth studio album. The terms of the deal state that the Zac Brown Band will work with Big Machine Label Group for marketing and distribution, while Southern Ground Artists will work on radio promotion, Republic will provide support in the area of non-country radio formats and international promotion, and Varvatos will oversee branding and styling.<ref name="Zac">{{cite news|author=Nate Rau|title=Zac Brown Band aligns with Big Machine|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2015/01/12/zac-brown-band-aligns-big-machine/21649505/|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|access-date=January 17, 2015|date=January 12, 2015}}</ref> Brown stated in a press release:

<blockquote>Southern Ground Artists together with John Varvatos Records, Big Machine Label Group, and Republic Records is the dream team for Zac Brown Band's evolution ... We're excited to reach new music fans worldwide.<ref name="Zac" /></blockquote>

===Addition of Clay Cook===
In January 2009, two months after "Chicken Fried" went to No.&nbsp;1, Atlanta native [[Clay Cook]] joined the Zac Brown Band as its multi-instrumentalist and high tenor vocalist. Cook had previously collaborated with [[John Mayer]] and [[Shawn Mullins]], and was also a member of the [[Marshall Tucker Band]] for two years prior to joining the Zac Brown Band.

Cook explains how he first met Brown:

{{blockquote|We ran into each other (in) 2003 in a club scene in Atlanta, where my band opened up for his band ... ever since then, we've been friendly ... and I think he just thought I was a singer-songwriter for a long time; and then we were on a (music) cruise ship together ... and I was playing with the Marshall Tucker Band at the time, and (Brown)'s band (also participated in the cruise) ... and he actually got to see me play the guitar ... and then he realized, 'I need this guy in my band,' I guess.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj69DZ-FHTE| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/Gj69DZ-FHTE| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=ExploreMusic chats with Clay Cook|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2010-12-10|access-date=2011-11-23}}{{cbignore}}</ref>}}

Brown himself admitted his strong desire to add Cook to the lineup, for he believed Cook's musicianship would enhance the Zac Brown Band's overall musical style:

{{blockquote|I'd been tryin' to get him in the band for three years, and you know, it's been a journey, but I always knew [he could make us better]. I'm a harmony fanatic. I love big harmonies and things, and we didn't have a high tenor, and Jimmy [De Martini], my fiddle player, sings a lot of the high stuff now, but havin' somebody that can actually sing on top of that, we've added a four-part harmony now that's searing, and the guy's a monster player, too."<ref name=gactv.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5942665,00.html|title=Zac Brown Band Expands On ''The Foundation''|publisher=GAC News|date=2009-04-21|access-date=2011-11-23}}</ref>}}

With the new Zac Brown Band lineup completed, the band released its second single, "[[Whatever It Is]]", which went to No.&nbsp;2. In October 2009, a third single, "[[Toes (Zac Brown Band song)|Toes]]", became the band's second Number One. The album's fourth single, and third No.&nbsp;1, was "[[Highway 20 Ride]]". "[[Free (Zac Brown Band song)|Free]]" was the album's fifth single and on the week of August 21, 2010, it also peaked at Number One.

===''Uncaged'' and ''The Grohl Sessions, Vol. 1''===
On April 25, 2012, it was announced via the Zac Brown Band's website that percussionist [[Daniel de los Reyes]] had joined the band on a permanent basis. De los Reyes had previously performed with the band as a touring musician and participated in the recording of their album ''[[Uncaged]]''. De los Reyes has also performed with artists and groups such as [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/zac-brown-talks-new-album-uncaged-out-july-10-new-band-member-and-search-for-that-pulse/2012/04/25/gIQA0wYKgT_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113062655/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/zac-brown-talks-new-album-uncaged-out-july-10-new-band-member-and-search-for-that-pulse/2012/04/25/gIQA0wYKgT_story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 13, 2019|title=Zac Brown talks new album 'Uncaged,' out July 10, new band member and search for 'that pulse'|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=April 25, 2012|access-date=April 29, 2012}}</ref> "[[Goodbye in Her Eyes]]" reached Number One on the [[Country Airplay]] chart in 2013.

In April 2014, the band announced its summer tour schedule, which included [[Kacey Musgraves]] as an opening act, and the addition of Matt Mangano as an eighth member. Mangano previously performed live with Zac Brown Band when they performed "Blackbird" on the "[[Pass the Jar: Zac Brown Band and Friends Live from the Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta|Pass The Jar]]" live album.

==Early life==
Brown was raised on [[Lake Lanier]], Georgia by his mother, Bettye, and stepfather Dr. Jody Moses, a dentist in [[Cumming, Georgia]]. The eleventh of twelve children, Brown attended Mashburn Elementary School in Cumming; [[Lakeview Academy]] in [[Gainesville, Georgia]]; and [[South Forsyth High School]] in Cumming. At age he moved to [[Dahlonega, Georgia]] where he graduated from [[Lumpkin County High School]]. Brown was given his mother's guitar at age 8, and one of his stepfather's patients was enlisted to teach him classical guitar. He completed two years of lessons, but soon after developed a love for [[bluegrass music]] while playing with his father and brother on weekend visits. In his mid-teens, Brown spent almost a year being tutored by a vocal coach from his church.

While still in high school, with [[James Taylor]] as his inspiration, Brown began playing solo gigs in local venues, performing country and pop [[cover version|cover]] songs.

The group also included Bruce Ford (bass) and Kevin Rouse (keyboard). They independently released an EP, "Shine a Light", in 2014.
